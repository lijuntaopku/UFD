0	kitsch is global A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it, and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as "well-worn," which seems to be a euphemism for "shop-worn," "clichï¿½," or "stupefyingly unoriginal." Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: "As It Is In Heaven" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the kï¿½ttbullar?) A standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes: -- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force; -- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia; -- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It; -- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is "Best Boy," a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in "There's Something About Mary," or turned into plaster saints as here.) So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of "The O.C." Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis-ï¿½-vis the USA: kitsch is global.
0	Chapellle didnt want to do these for a reason... They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone. Tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though
0	Enough of too much awready! The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7 million people. I'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie. Usually when a movie runs over 2 hours, it's because there's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in. In the case of Hard Boiled, the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by John Woo's desire to get into the Guinness Book of Records for "most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture." Chow Yun-Fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay, and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. He shoots (usually with a pistol in each hand) while diving headlong over furniture, while swinging from a rope, while sliding down a banister(!), while being hurled through the air by explosions. Sometimes he even shoots while standing still. And he shoots, and shoots, and shoots. And the bad guys shoot, and shoot, and shoot. And Yun-Fat's fellow cops shoot, and shoot, and -- you get the idea. There are some fine action scenes in this film, but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended. There wasn't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next, and it became painfully repetitious. Personally I would highly recommend The Replacement Killers over Hard Boiled. There's plenty of Yun-Fat's balletic shoot-em-up action, but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire
0	The Trinity Collection The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered. It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD. If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality
0	It's about kids at a "musical camp" for wannabe performers These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at "Camp Ovation" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a "one hit wonder" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a "fag hag", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem. There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people.
0	terrible baby video I cannot believe this is billed as a baby video. The images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value. I personally like the Baby Miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby.
0	Predictable but Zooey saves the day With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained. Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie
0	Not what I was expecting If you are looking for a dvd that is filled with White Stripes music and interviews, look elsewhere. The item description says it has over 40 minutes of in-depth interviews, but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes (if that) of this is actually with the band (and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd). It has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the White Stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning. It is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details, but it is not something I will watch again. (If Jack & Meg were telling their own story, THAT would be worth it)
0	Embarrassing I didn't even want to see this movie, but my brother read the book and wanted to see it. (We were unaware of the fact that this wasn't meant to follow the book...) Everything was poorly done in this movie. Even Hans Zimmer's score didn't save it. I've mentioned that I'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars, and if I could, I'd give it negative ten
0	The Big Sleep Here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made! I couldn't believe what I was watching! Moreover,I am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating. What is going on? Is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about? Am I naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain? Where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work,hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema's most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor Ralph Fiennes? How I long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do - entertain.Sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as "The Constant Gardener" it appears that we unfortunate "real" film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future.
0	Will the real Herzog please emerge. This was so messy and Mr. Dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion. YUK.!..my partner and I were disgusted. He and his deceased friend/photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag-Degenerates for sure.Too damn bad for your buddy. It was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring/bold/ and challenging as some of Herzogs past films. We have been fans for 20+ years. Looks like he did it for the money and Dorrington rode Herzogs coatails in a way. Geez..I had just watched March of the Penguins and Wings of Migration and those! are truly documentaries made by film experts. The babbling and rambling on in The White Diamond made me pity Herzog. He did it for the $ maybe.Dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way I suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts. Hey Dorrington-Who cares about you? Herzog..Get out of California before you rot
0	Not Funny I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all
0	Very Poor Quality DVD Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one

0	This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called "Look Out, Officer" that Stephen Chow made in 1990. Shaolin Idiot is not out yet to my knowledge. If you want Stephen Chow's "Look Out, Officer" you should buy this DVD if not, don't.
0	What a complete waste of time To say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement. Almost every joke in this movie that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego. The film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew. This movie comes across as crass, tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects. Thank God I borrowed this movie and didn't pay anything to rent it. I won't be watching another Kevin Smith movie anytime soon
0	Pro-Apartheid propaganda produced by Jack Abramoff. Yes, that Jack Abramoff! Interestingly, this pro-apartheid film was produced and written by Jack Abramoff, now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest American congressional corruption scandal in a generation. Yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators, robbed several native american tribes blind, tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary, and called the Choctaw tribal council "Monkeys" and "troglodytes", had an interesting earlier career. He was disqualified from the student government election in his Beverly Hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits. He took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, and longtime republican insider Grover Norquist. But more relevant to this movie, well into the 1990's while actively working in the Hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only Apartheid Goverment of the old South Africa, and to oppose and discredit Nelson Mandela and the ANC's struggle for majority rule and racial equality. During this period, he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda, paid for by the Apartheid government in the old South Africa, equating the struggle for black liberation in South Africa with communism and the Soviet Union, and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority Afrikkaner government. The hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries, or so called soldiers of fortune, as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film, were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid. An amazing historical anomoly, this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history, involving bribery,favors, protection of sweatshops (in US colonies where women are forced into having abortions), fraud, the chritian coalition, pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america, and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner, the owner of Sun Cruises, when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line. My advice, buy it used for historical purposes, not new. This guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the American people. Let's not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder, racial segregation, perversion of the constitution, police state style abuses of civil rights, and many other crimes against humanity. Let's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the USA. Let this movie be a record of the power of Hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people, or to turn away from evil and tell the truth. Let's make a different legacy this time around
0	For The Hardcore 50 Cent Fans Only (2 Stars) I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent fan, but I went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of XXL. It wasn't all that entertaining. The documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't already know. We've seen all these videos before, but the video for &quot;Heat&quot; is straight wack. The street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny. The Show In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that's being said. The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 Mile DVD trailer? The DVD borders on corny, but the CD isn't that bad. These are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been able to find the &quot;8 Mile Road (G Unit Remix)&quot; ever since I lost my underground CD. Lloyd Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD / DVD release. If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that he's nowhere to be found on this release. Overall, The New Breed isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or two uses. The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably have them already. I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 Cent / G Unit fans
0	Worst action movie ever Just look how many are for sale, thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is. It has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting. I fastforwarded about 70% of the movie! and what got me was on the back it says "Family-Friendly" im still laughing about that! What has this world come to? I would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone! Even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn't buy or rent this movie. Im embarassed that I rented it! Please turn away now
0	American Bob I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back?
0	Poorly Produced DVD This is a review of the DVD, not the World Series. Please save your comments re the Series for the sports blogs. In this day and age, for Major League Baseball to produce a non-anamorphic DVD is absolutely pathetic. This DVD was made for a widescreen TV (16:9 ratio), but cannot take advantage of it, because it is non-anamorphic, meaning it will not take up the full widescreen. It has black bars on all four sides. They may as well have made it full screen instead, with a 4:3 ratio. Also, in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the DVD out quickly, they decided not to include footage from the season, to show nothing of the Tigers' play-off run, and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players. ("Gee, was it exciting to be out on the mound!") I am an avid Cardinals fan, but this DVD was not worth the $14.99 I paid for it. Major League Baseball, as usual, cheats its fans. Another lesson they fail to learn from Pro Football
0	What happened? After seeing Match Point, which I loved, I figured I had to see Scoop. All I can say is "Oh my GAWD!" Scoop is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Woody Allen really should stay out of his own movies. And the rest of it, the story, acting, editing etc, were just painful to watch. I can't believe he went from Match Point to this dribble
0	worst Bond movie? Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable. What's so bad about it? Well, how shall I begin . . . (1) Sean Connery is a dud. There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions. To be fair, he had no decent material to play. The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before. But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here. (2) The action scenes are uninspiring. I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes. Here, the action is strictly second-rate. (3) Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances. (4) There is literally no reason to see this in favor of "Thunderball," of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements. In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled. (5) There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles. Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place. The actor playing the "new" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either. (6) The music is bad. The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon. I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there. All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of "Casino Royale" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies. It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion
0	Funny Premise - Unfunny Film I was very disappointed with this film. The premise was really intriguing, with Elvis switching places with an Elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at Graceland leaving the real Elvis to scratch out a living as - what else - an Elvis "impersonator." And now, at the end of The King's life, he's a semi-invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy. Since it's Texas, the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to Stevie Ray Vaughn. And oh, yeah, JFK is also in this nursing home, having inexplicably been transformed into Ozzie Davis. How can you miss with a setup like this? Well, for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there's no real need to provide any additional comedy. The movie is flat, with very little humor. As other reviewers have noted, it moves at a glacial pace, even allowing for the protagonists being 80-somethings who don't move like they used to. Sure, the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film, but there's no point in making a comdey that isn't funny. Nice try, but booooooooooring. Not at all recommended.
0	Argento fans should avoid this unless completists Compared to Argento, I must say that Mario Bava is for me entirely overrated. He might be a pioneer, but as a stylist he is sadly lacking. His seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry, even if you like horror films. Argento fans seeking out 'Shock' on the strength of Daria Nicolodi's starring role, music by two members of Goblin (under the nom-de-plume 'A.Libra)and Srgento's supposed giallio-based debt to Bava should buy 'Shock' with caution. Although it is an authentic slice of Eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror Hollywood churns out, it is still a fairly dreary, dull, repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances. Finally, the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of Jess Franco's rubbish (and that's saying something) - my DVD of the silly 'She Killed In Ecstasy', filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better. Shame Daria never made films without Argento that are better than this..
0	Whip Me Til I'm Dead- A Real Bore I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest. There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!" So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.
0	Pretty Bad I am a Howard Stern fanatic and a softball fanantic. I couldn't go wrong with this movie, right? Wrong! It is pretty bad. I was disappointed with Artie's project. Gross jokes terrible acting. There are a couple of funny scenes. Wait until it is on sale
0	Another teen slasher So what kind of movie is this from the director of "I know what you did last summer?" It's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher movie. They rode into this film with the same clichéd scares, a young group of teens, a psycho killer, and a traditional ending. So is it worth seeing? That I can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply "an unstoppable evil force." But individually, do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece? Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no. Let's take a look at some of them; Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add. The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film. The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo. Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful. Special Effects- They set this up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard Halloween "stage blood" which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky special effects, including the last major one in the film. The Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks like....I'm sure they don't run like football players. So what overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out from any normal Hollywood production. My recommendation? It's ok. I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again...
0	Beautiful, but overrated This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors. Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity. The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together. Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away. The end. I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was. In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress. It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else. I have issues with some of the pacing as well. I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much. Not a good sign. So, for what it is, it's okay. Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy.
0	Good suspense bad story In this film made in UK and Luxembourg, Madeline Stowe stars as Senga. Senga and her daughter Nat are driving at midnight after visiting Nat's father. They bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop. Nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult. And we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter. Both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood. Why they do so is never explained. And even at this point when Senga is trying to rescue Nat, she still acts like a brat. The last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion. And becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating I assigned. That good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction, not the wirtting. The movie is dark and suspenseful. Though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie, it does keep you on the edge of the seat as Senga tries to rescue her daughter
0	Hard to Review I would love to provide a review of this DVD, however since I've not received it, despite having placed my order in August (it's now November)and having written to Amazon Customer Service about the matter (as yet unanswered) I'm afraid any review will have to wait
0	Does He Ever Wear a Different Coat? What's wrong with this show? 1. Jim wears the same pants, coat, and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series. 2. A slow, sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums. 3. Won't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her? 4. Do you really believe that this middle-aged, heavy fellow would drive a Firebird - a tight fitting car? 5. Angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	just another dumb preppie vs. nerd movie This movie has been done over and over again, with different actors and by different directors, but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring. Don't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind.... buy something original or save your money
0	There's a big difference between nudity and quality nudity. If the girls in this film were considered "hot" back in 1979 then I'm glad I was still in preschool. Some unattractive women, not college age girls, but actual 30-year-old women who cannot get into the popular Pi sorority start their own sorority called H.O.T.S. which stands for Help Out The Seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie. The goal of the H.O.T.S. girls is to steal all the guys away from Pi house, so they throw "wild" parties, jump topless out of a airplane (too bad the camera was on the ground), fly a hot air balloon over the Pi house to launch pies on the Pi girls as they sunbathe topless, etc. The script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old, which isn't a bad thing. I liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice. Unfortunately I didn't find any of the girls even remotely attractive. If this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with Nikki Ziering, Brittany Daniel, Shannon Elizabeth and Jenna Jameson as the four main H.O.T.S. girls and maybe Catherine Bell as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in DVD sales. I also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots. How rude
0	Where is the Wolf? Just Horrendous! With the New Year just more than six hours away, I must tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon, quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid the flick "Darkwolf" for many moons to come. What a joke. What a silly, stupid, insult to one's intelligence. The script could have been written by my dog Stan...and even then, I give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine. Let's put it this way. Have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much, you simply didn't give a ^&^%* if they got blown away? I was hoping the entire cast got mulched by Mr. Wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser. Go "Darkwolf". Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director, producer, writer and editors as quickly as possible...and don't wait until the next full moon. "Darkwolf" is an insult to motion pictures. More so, it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as "The Wolf Man", "Wolfen" and "The Howling", not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic "An American Werewolf in London". Need I say more? "Darkwolf" has no bite. It's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion. The box claims this flick to be "Half Man. Half Wolf. Pure Evil." In reality it is Half/Whole Stupid. Half/Whole Worthless. ...and...Pure ^%&*! Get my drift? At midnight...as we turn another page and the new year unfolds...I promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman", much more than "Darkwolf". I'm off to watch yet another New Year's flick before dawn. I need to make amends to Lon Chaney, Jr. before midnight. Bottom line, it was a film you didn't really care "where" the "wolf" came from, or where the werewolf was going. Pitiful...embarrassing..."I've seen the bad moon rising" but this one makes me wish it would set!
0	Miserable acting, horrible script, inane directing. What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator. Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite. Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story. As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film. Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast. This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents? It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't. Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths. Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous "nurse nipple" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember. But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry. Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting. His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre. Most high-school students do better than this. Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film. On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget. But when the "story" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film. Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments. But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of worst films I've ever subjected myself to
0	Casshan Volume 2 I felt a little ripped off, when I got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from Amazon.Com. Movie wise, volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1, with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and Eng subtitle. Amazon could have at least indicated that in the &quot;description&quot;
0	a 'difficult' movie; unfortunately, it ain't very good either It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's "Foxes". Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious "Fatal Attraction", "Foxes" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life. The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused. The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with. Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's "On The Radio" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel. Overall though, "Foxes" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation
0	One Of Andersons Misses I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.
1	The Best Season Yet Season 3 of The L-Word is by far the best yet. The character development and story have come so far since the 1st season, and are even better than season 2. They have scaled back the sex a little bit, but when they do put it in, the sparks really fly. I love the l-word
1	I've always dreamt for a DVD like this! This has 110 minutes of the 1995 concert performed at Symphony Hall, Birmingham...& also has 3 music videos Don't Pay The Ferryman, Missing You, & Separate Tables!!
1	Good choice for light entertainment The musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no "square" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it again. The film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd
1	GIMME A BREAK! As if this set could be anything BUT five stars!!! Barbra Streisand - four of her films on their DVD debut - her own commentary - oy vey! Order it now and plan a vacation day for the day after you get delivery
1	Russians Love a Good Soap Just Like Us I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable
1	Party Hardy with Bear This DVD contains three episodes of "Bear in the Big Blue House." The first two have a birthday party theme. The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it is still rocking. The fun starts with "Mouse Party" when our friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to "Happy, Happy Birthday" when the time comes for Tutter's big party. Next comes "Bear's Birthday Bash." This is an episode that recalls "Mouse Party" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise party. Finally, "Dancin' the Day Away" finds everyone in the Big Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really can. This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs
1	Stroke of Genius I'm not a golfing buff, but found the story and golf very good. I enjoyed this movie very much
1	An Excellent Adaptation of an Excellent Novel. David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial). The supporting cast added to the film: Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role. This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction. Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities. There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people. This movie is not completely faithful to the movie. Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel. Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first. I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie). True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character. Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either. As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy. This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced). The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character. (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome", and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.) Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister. This is because of its dependence on situation ethics. Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations. In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie. I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture.
0	let's make this short and sweet... This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing. I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it. Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again. I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake. This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long. Hidalgo is the name of the horse. So what? That's about as boring as this movie. So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo. I did not, however, like this movie. It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again. If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time
0	Byou My 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with. I think it is best for those with a dance background. The music is good, though
0	Femme Fatales or Very Lame? Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid
1	A clear understanding as to why Enron fell I am a CPA & I watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take, essentially because of the fall of Enron. I have since bought the video & watched it at least 5 other times. Of course there are political slants. For example, they try & tie the Bush administration(s)(Sr. & Jr.) to Enron. But, the majority of the film deals with what happened to Enron, so that in the end, the stock you purchased was worth $0. I would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary. A riveting documentary on the rise & fall of Enron & who the major players in Enron were.
0	Not too impressed The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot. Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine. Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.
1	This is just great stuff..... Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story), but this is "Boogie Nights". I can't say this movie was "over-looked", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, "Fan-f**k-ing-tastic". Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form. What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people. Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works. I can't hear "Sister Christian" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will) Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive. If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it
1	Brilliant! These guys are terrific! I'm a student of Shakespeare, so every time I read a play I haven't read before I pull out this DVD to see what they've done to it! After reading Coriolanus I was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play wasn't appropriate for children. If you love Shakespeare, or are just curious about Shakespeare, buy this DVD
0	The Carpetborers This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish. It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp. Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot. George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on "The A-Team". Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture. It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill. Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy. The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular). If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow
1	A simple plot with some great slapstick action and pure comedy I first saw Help! when I was in middle school, rifling through my parents' VHS collection. My friends and I were won over by this silly comedy and the Fab Four, and I have treasured the movie ever since. It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy. The plot is pure genius in its simplicity: a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger. A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice. A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger. The Beatles are absolutely clueless. So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious. The DVD I bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in French. So once you've seen Help! enough times to know every line by heart, try it out in a foreign language, and laugh even harder at The Beatles speaking in French. Go... to... THE WINDOW... GO... TO... the window..
1	good cop movie this is more realistic then some may admit. you see it all the time in the stories on tv, reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is, best example is michael jackson. everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side. that is what this movie is all about. the movie depicts the evil intentions of 2 immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders. the plot was pretty original. i don't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong. it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism. you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting. there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie. almost to the point of overwhelming, but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie. i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi. storylines are a bit different, but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story.
0	Not as good as Miyazaki's other titles This isn't as good as Spritied Away or Princess Mononoke. It's not a bad film but it didn't capture me as well as the other films did
1	Shamefully Overlooked Southern Gothic Murder Mystery Has Atmosphere, Genuine Thrills and the Superb Blanchett This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the "Spider-Man" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then. Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie. Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child. While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy. In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us. The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's "Furniture Room Lullaby" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer
0	yeah yeah yeah I lasted 10 minutes. At times, I believe Hunter S. Thompson was able to write. This was not one of those times. His gonzo humor was just over the top, not funny, and stale to these tired eyes. Maybe it was groundbreaking once, but I doubt it. Maybe you should watch it while stoned. He probably wrote it that way.
0	A totally boring movie I terribly disappointed by this movie. It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have. This lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end. The cops were basically two idiots who couldn't solve the crime on their own. Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie.
0	Mary Ann and Sissy Spacek I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows. This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie.
0	The novelty's worn off, and it's left as a former shell of itself On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent.
0	Be Warned I love this film. It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing. I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used. I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches. In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture. I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves. I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print . One of the worst I've ever seen
1	Teusdays with Mauri Terriffic Movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt
0	Land of Oprahisms Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry
0	watered down unanswered questions I unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time.. this was the best of them.. the others were pure wastes of money. While this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point. if you've seen "what the bleep" dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds.
1	Better of many older submarine thrillers I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice
1	A beautiful piece of cinematographic work "From Hell" is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie. Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful. Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American. This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good). "From Hell" makes a great addition to any movie collection.
1	Very Pleasantly Surprised! We rented this movie not expecting too much. We like this genre (moron movies). Unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie, we had no trouble at all following the plot. We just thought this movie was a scream! Lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell. What's not to like? If you like this type of movie, you will love it! Mac McCaule
1	Good Idea, altered for Artistic Purposes This is a great "feel good" movie, but Hollywood altered the story for theatricality. In the film, a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up, in one year, to become calculus winners. There is a good backgroud article at: http://reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml that describes how the process took ten years, so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the AP calculus exam. Jaime Escalante (played by Edward James Olmos of "Miami Vice" fame) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time, reaching back to the junior high school that fed Garfield High. The way that the movie was done, however, allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them, especially their parents. Remarkably, at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under Escalante's leadership. That's 400 fewer future employees for KFC and MacDonald's. (As Escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student, "So tough guys don't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living?") Eventually, it appears that the Education Establishment won out, driving the brilliant teacher out, and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future. The idea is great, that no student should be regarded as hopeless, and that all should be encouraged to try, but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows.
0	Gave it a Chance but... I really did give this a chance but I can't say I like the show. It focuses more on the "police" aspect and less on the science, which differentiates the CSI series from most of the other garbage out there. I know David Caruso has his fans but I just can't appreciate him in this vehicle...
1	Highly Recommended!!! I first found out Hannah Montana when I realised I saw Billy Ray Cyrus, thinking it was someone else at first. Thank goodness I was wrong!!! I am quite older than being 13, (almost 30) but I loved Billy Ray Cyrus when he first came out in early 1990's, and still do. Now that his daughter Miley has her own show and an awesome voice, I not only do I get to see and hear him again, but also his own daughter following a similar career as he has. I knew I had to buy the dvd, not question there. It's a piece of my past, when I was a teen, but it's a great way to remind myself that life is not always about work. It tells me to be a kid at heart, and laugh every now and then!!
1	U2's Best Live DVD Since ZooTV From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs. The bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real attraction. As it should be. Two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB. I also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums. Good call! Also, Many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions), Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original of the Species (acoustic piano ballad). This was the first major U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list. For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo, Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not represented here. Here's hoping they release at least one more Vertigo Tour DVD...
0	Treasure fans Beware! Many of these shorts on this DVD (as well as the other DVD's in this series) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these DVD's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you'll see on the cartoons
1	Great DVD! The Snake tells all... Awesome DVD! Jake Roberts tells you everything from origin of the DDT to the drug addiction to the last time he appeared on WWE television. This is definitely a must have! Jake the Snake is a true legend and deserves to in the Hall of Fame. Maybe it will happen in 2006
0	Mediocre is good? I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie. Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language! A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
0	Loaded deck shoots blanks Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film
1	Left & Right Brain Videos were big hits at our house! I purchased these used from a bookstore that buys and resells used books and videos. I think my baby boy was about 5 months old at the time. These were the ONLY videos that ever captured his attention at that young age. Any other video--Disney, Baby Einstein, etc.--just had him crying within a few minutes. These, though, he would watch to the end, fascinated. To this day, he loves them, and he is now 15 months old; the tapes are WORN OUT so I am reordering them both. Not only does he still love them, but I just had a new baby, and I am hoping they will entertain her just as much. In fact, the other night, we accidentally woke him up and he cried and cried and wouldn't go back to sleep. Finally, in desperation, my husband popped one of these into the VCR, and my son was INSTANTLY quieted the moment he heard the familiar music; in no time at all he was ready to go back to bed. We have since purchased most of the other titles in the Brainy Baby series--he loves them all, the music, the images of the babies, etc. The ABC video is especially well-done. He also gradually learned to enjoy other types of videos by Baby Einstein, Sesame Street, etc. But these two left & right brain videos are still his very favorites.
1	Really? I didn't notice it was a bad movie. All I saw was Johnny Depp. Seriously, it's a great movie. I think maybe people are forgeting this started out as a childrens' movie.
1	A must for the home collection I'm trying to decide which of the three I love the best, but all should be part of one's home library. I often view them while I'm on my exercise bike and always pedal faster! It's easy to forget you're sweating while watching people on the screen being chased by dinosaurs. Perhaps gyms across the country should invest in the Jurassic Park movie collection? Chrissy K. McVay - Autho
0	MacGyver on stupid pills As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action
1	It was worth the money! I had previously bought the 1st version. Liked it very much. So I was eagerly looking forward to this latest version. Happy to know that this version has more new Science related information - which was what I was interested in. And for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist, there is a seperate section entirely on Interviews. The best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations. For those who have not seen the 1st version, I think it is alright to watch this. Viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie. The interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer. Everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world, universe and what they are made of. If you had deep question about the reality, you might find an answer in this movie. -- Ravi, Singapor
1	KNOWLEDGE Simply Fantastic! Anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this. Some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children.
0	it skips chapters I have now received 2 copies of this DVD and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly. My personal favorite is the episode were Jerry is trying to become homecoming queen. It skips a whole chapter... THE WEESLE & THE CHICKEN... maybe the best comedy I have ever seen. Please check your copy and see if this happens, it is not the fault of Amazon it is a bad transfer to DVD that needs to be fixed. If you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene, and skip to the next chapter. To see the chapter, go backard 1 chapter. I have had the same problem on all DVD players
1	one of the best asian family film i have seen Flawless and Beautifully Rieveting "The Joy Luck Club" has to be the best movie I have ever seen, and probably will be the only one of it's kind. The story is beautiful and timeless and I encourage everyone to see it. It makes you think of the relationships of your family and how, even though this is a movie, it can impact you beyond belief. It will rock you to the core of your being and I am living proof
0	so many gaps in the story This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story
1	A good bit of drama mixed in with fun.... Y'know - I don't care what anyone else says 'bout this film. I liked it so there... :g: It was a good bit of childish fun at times, as well as a lot of drama. I cried my eyes out for those children because of their father being at war. It's got funny stuff with the cousin and "It", which Eddie voices ever so brilliantly... and I loved the aunt.. I knew she was something special, siding with the children and helping them. I loved her! Kenneth Brannagh was hilarious as well. I don't know - I just loved it. I think you should give it a dry. I think it's a good mix between a typical family movie that has a good thing to say to the viewer and a fanstasy like CS Lewis or even Tolkien at times. the moral of the story... wishes can't last forever... but you'll just have to see the movie to see what I'm talking about, now won't you? :
0	A disgrace to any integral female There are two main female characters in the plot: one is a man-eater who will sleep her way to the top (although she may not even need it because she is good independently) and the other is the jealous and depressed housewife who gave up her career for the sake of her husband's. This is a man's fantasy and nightmare come true in one; and a boring cliche for all the intelligent and responsible females of the world. To all the Hollywood men out there: You can't brainwash us anymore with your b/s; okay??
0	this movie has nothing to it! This movie is dumb. It would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters. And I think I saw this movie before, it was called madagascar! Don't get this movie! It short and pointless. If you want to watch something with your kids, don't pick this up. I recomend Chiken Little or the incredibles! sure chiken little might be short, but atleast it tells about its characters! I really don't recomend this one...at all! P.S. Don't buy it, watch it or... anything else that is similer. What a snoozer, twenty bucks is such a loss
1	Pretty good despite cheesy title It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time
1	Great dancing Really nice dancing, with some innovative moves and choreography. The dancers are definetely top notch, just like their credentials would suggest. If do not want to watch another booooring and hokey ballroom show, this is the DVD for you. It ranks up there with "Shall We Dance"(Japanese version) as a great dance DVD. The last samba number is amazing. If there is one thing I would change with the show, it is that it does NOT have enough latin dancing. I kept waiting in vain for another chacha and a good salsa or rueda, and nothing happened ("Burn the Floor" guys - are you listening!?)
0	I wish I could go lower than this. This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny.
1	not bad i read some of the reviews before i purchased it. i agree that the dvd was not made with high tech, the toys used were not even new at all, the instructors making weird sounds (to me). i was disappointed at first and planned to sell it right away. but i thought i should give a try to my son, 16 months. surprisingly,it catches my 16 month boy full attention(he would not pay attention at all to baby bumblebee). he watches for over 2 weeks, he started to copy the sounds and gestures they made in the dvd. sometimes, he will even make the sounds before the instructor does. though , he still only says mama, but i am already so happy with the current result.
0	It's Flat & It's Not Funny I love Dave's TV show, it's really hilarious, so I was expecting a lot when I bought this DVD as part of a two-pack with Richard Pryor. After 10 minutes of Dave, I started thinking, "when am I going to laugh?" After 20 minutes, I got bored so I started listening to the audience for this live show. They were laughing (a little) & not all that often, so I concluded that it wasn't just my mood, this just wasn't funny. After 30 minutes, I turned it off. I can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time, even if you're a Dave fan, as I am. I can't tell you if the rest is funny or not, because I didn't watch it. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was expecting Richard Pryor, which I had watched first. My recommendation is either to buy only the Pryor DVD (which is terrific), or watch the Chappelle DVD first, so it won't suffer by comparison
0	Another one of those silly 80's movies. The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete
1	You'll be in stitches! It's a [more vulnerable] Patton in a white coat, running a hospital, and it's all great fun, with a good story from an Oscar-winning script. You have to love it when Scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow. You half-expect him to finish her off with "There are brave men DYING out there!"
1	"Try this for a deep, dark secret..." Yes, I was a kid growing up in the '80s and one of my favorite shows was the charming Remington Steele, which I actually preferred to Moonlighting. Pierce Brosnan was so cool and debonair and so dang British that I wanted to be like him. The fact that he was a con-man and had a mysterious past added to the mystique. And Lord, I had such a crush on Laura Holt, who was beautiful, clever, earnest, athletic and kinda prudish (turns out, our little Miss Prim & Proper had a few urges she firmly kept in check). Anyways, I'm a sucker for freckles. One of the best things about Season One was the ultra-cool theme song by the great Henry Mancini. The music exuded sheer class and sexiness and seemed to promise champagne and skullduggery. Another cool thing was the intro voice-over of Stephanie Zimbalist: "Try this for a deep, dark secret. The great detective Remington Steele? He doesn't exist. I invented him. Follow..." And so, we do. Skip this paragraph if you know the show's premise. Laura Holt is a very capable sleuth whose private investigative agency isn't drawing in the clients, mostly because she's a woman. So she invents a front man - a decidedly masculine superior - named Remington Steele (according to Laura, "Remington" is derived from a brand of typewriter, while "Steele" is from the Pittsburg Steelers). Soon, sure enough, clients are coming in droves. And then, one day, HE walked in. Episode one, License to Steele, tells of the chance encounter between Laura Holt and a charming, urbane thief who steals her heart and, while he's at it, the name and identity of her agency. The show Remington Steele ushered in a short era of sophistication and sly humor that recalled the best of vintage Hollywood. Brosnan and Zimbalist may not have gotten along well in real life, but as Steele and Holt, they were a match made in heaven. The show was ably supported by the yearning Murphy (James Read), who never did get over his suspicions (not totally unfounded) about Steele, and the gum-chewing Bernice Fox (Janet DeMay), whose name Remington chose to not clearly remember, much to her annoyance. Too bad the powers-that-be decided Murphy and Bernice were in the way of Remington and Laura's blossoming romance; they were written out by season two. The mysteries themselves weren't all that original, more than a few being patterned after the plots of famous movies, which ties in nicely with Remington's penchant for quoting from Hollywood's golden age. But viewers didn't tune in for the quality of the mystery elements (don't get me wrong, they didn't suck), but rather - much like the classic Thin Man films - for the nova-intense chemistry between the two leads and their up-and-down romantic relationship. It would take a few seasons before their always-on-the-verge-but-never-quite-consumated flirtation became frustrating for the audience. This season is the first and by far the best. Highlight episodes of Season One are: License to Steele (episode 1) - Private eye Laura Holt is hired to protect some valuable, high profile jewelry, but an enigmatic (but very suave) British scam artist keeps popping up. Serious eye contact and innuendos are exchanged between the two, which later results in the con-man (who has his own problems) taking up the identity of the fictitious Remington Steele. Needless to say, a must see episode. Thou Shalt Not Steele (episode 5) - A woman (Cassandra Harris, Brosnan's real wife at the time) from Steele's mysterious past convinces Steele to steal a painting rumored to be cursed from a Los Angeles museum exhibit. Problem is, Laura had already contracted to protect the valuable painting. Fun episode with Remington and Laura dabbling in professional thieving. This is the debut of Felicia, Remington's ex-flame, who shows up again in season 4. In the Steele of the Night (episode 9) - Laura and Murphy attend a reunion party consisting of sleuths who used to work for the Havenhurst agency. One of the detectives is killed and Remington (who crashes the get-together) is elected to solve the murder. Very amusing, as Laura handfeeds clues to Remington, who attempts to look knowledgeable in front of his "peers." Steele Trap (episode 10) - This one channels Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None. Remington and Laura show up at a weekend bash on the private island of a smut magazine publisher. And then people start getting killed off one by one. Vintage Steele (episode 19) - Shenanigans in a winery and a recurring corpse. Laura stripteases and the two finally kiss. This is a cool episode and one of the most romantic. We finally find out stuff about Laura's past, specifically the reason why Laura doesn't like to mix business with pleasure. Steele's Gold (episode 20) - Remington, Laura, and Murphy follow a prospector's journal, hoping to unearth gold. Hijinks in a ghost town and a wild treasure hunt in the desert. Fun episode. Sting of Steele (episode 21) - The first sighting of Daniel Chalmers (Efrem Zimbalist Jr. - Stephanie's dad), Remington's mentor and surrogate dad, who shows up needing Steele's assistance in putting on an intricate sting to shake some villains off his back. Another vintage episode. This box set contains four discs with all 22 episodes. Special features contain three episode commentaries (License to Steele, Tempered Steele, and Vintage Steele), as well as several making-of featurettes and character bios. Give this show a chance and see why it launched Pierce Brosnan to Hollywood's stratosphere.
0	Not a Comedy This movie is being described and sold as a comedy. It is not one. It has several funny lines, but the movie is more of a romantic drama. If you are looking for a comedy I do not recommend this at all
0	very stagnant I like Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool a lot. I think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie. But Under the Sand is a very typical French movie which makes most people don't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a French movie. I finally persuaded my husband that Francois Ozon is different and this movie will be good, it turned out to be a nightmare, pointlessly soul strangeling movie. I would not recommend unless you are a big fun of Ozon or this type of movies
1	GREAT PRICE AND QUICK SHIPPING THE LOWEST PRICE AT THE TIME I ORDERED IT AND REAL QUICK SHIPPING TOO
0	Why oh why? Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash... Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window. First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it. MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book! I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film. If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book. Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one
0	So 'politically correct' it sucks! "I can't believe they named me after that book--it's so sexist!" After Amelie, where she was a delight, as well as open-minded, AT should have passed on this loser! Political correctness is just intolerance by another name! But you can't tell a liberal that! It's bad here in USA but I suppose the French must be the worst? They have fined Bardot for merely expressing her opinions that muslims are barbaric! Talk about intolerant.
1	Good information... I bought this DVD and I was not disappointed. I give it a 4 only because there wasn't complete balance in all of the "experts". Particularly the Mary Magdelene expert. Not that it really mattered, but there was now counterpoint to her beliefs that "Jesus used to kiss Mary on the mouth, much to the Disciples chagrin". For those who claim bias, I would slightly disagree. Dan Brown has said that his book was fiction. So for National Geographic to create a documentary investigating something that was ficticious from the start is admirable. Some Amazon reviewers call this DVD biased and even believe that the Catholic Church funded the DVD. I honestly beg to differ. The Da Vinci Code is a fanciful story. So for National Geographic to take the bait and create this DVD, gives Dan Brown more exposure. If anything, this DVD portrays the early Catholic Church as misogynous with their negative and false depiction of Mary Magdelene. The debunking of The Priory of Sion with its exclusive membership is comical as well. But they had to research it as it was derived from the book. The DVD Bonus features are pretty good as well. They give you a little True/False quiz at the end. Man will continue to search for proof. However, those who believe in God (and have a relationship with him), need not apply empirical evidence or follow logical conclusions to prove or disprove the Da Vinci Code. Even if the Da Vinci Code was completely true (which it isn't), that wouldn't change my faith or belief. This is something that the DVD touched on. It is Christ's message that is important, not necessarily His social life.
0	A Celebration of Hopelessness I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic".
1	Good relationship movie I really enjoyed this movie if only for Joan Allen's portrayal of a bitter blooming-alcoholic living in the 'burbs with 4 beautiful daughters around 15 to 21. Kevin plays a retired baseball player now DJ (for WRIF-FM, the station I listened to often in Detroit when I was in my late teens and early '20s). He too drinks way too much. They find solace in each other. I loved watching Joan Allen and the movie does have a good script. I liked all the major characters in it except one. All but the detestable middle age guy. He only goes out with young women is made to be the guy you love to hate. I think most women over 40 will like this movie. I highly recommend it to them and anyone who enjoys films about relationships.
0	Exercise video for people who really aren't serious This video is broken into six 10-minute sections. Who in their right mind would work out for only 10 minutes? This is not going to accomplish anything. Well, you think I'll just do all of the workouts one right after the other. This is silly too, because each 10 minute segment includes a warmup, small workout routine, and stretches. Unless it is okay with you to do all this over and over again, it is not an effective use of your time. Especially if you are truly trying to accomplish a goal
1	Slow building classic Horror Saw Burnt Offerings first as a kid on TV, just realized this was the title of it after seeing the picture on the back of the box of the old woman in a chair sitting by the window, a very classic horror image I didn't forget. The story builds slowly, as the small family of Mother, Father, Son and Aunt begin to experience strange occurences in the giant mansion. There's one room with an old lady in it that we don't get to see till the end, which really builds up some fear in a effective way, rather than quick, cheap scares like so many films rely on these days. The ending is truly classic. This one's worth watching for Haunted Mansion fans. There's very little you see, but very much that is suggested. Has some similarities to The Shining
0	Good performances, astoundingly bad script Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane, two otherwise talented actors, completely embarass themselves in this absurd, trite and predictable "thriller" that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done. Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all? While the performances are all good, the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they're given to work with. Every plot "twist" can be seen coming a mile away. Some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity, case in point: when Skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun. Go insult our intelligence somewhere else. And what's with all the product placement? This probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales. Shameless. If there's any saving grace to this movie, it is Leelee Sobieski, although it's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey. She deserves a script that equals her talent. But she is certainly nice to watch, especially the scene where she strips down to her 2-piece bathing suit revealing her bodicious, delicious, nutritious, I-want-some-of-that-icious body. But hey, when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal, right? Rent this one first if you absolutely must see it.
0	First rule of the fight club - You must be a white male to love this movie This movie was very much like American Beauty, except it was a little better. This kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern American life. But for all other people, including myself, Fight Club was not that good. And I GET the movie. I am a consumer, like most Americans. But not to a degree where I can relate to Jack who is the main character. Starting a fight club to re-discover masculinity or one's identity is an absurd idea. What is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of Fight Club. No wonder the only people that joins the Fight Club in the movie are white males. No wonder that the only real people in my life that I saw raving about this movie so far has been all "white men". The movie does speak one truth. Modern American life has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans. Like I said, I have not come to that point yet and I do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful. People should build a family, serve their community, and make real friends to live a happy and significant life. Fight Club is not necessary unless you really became like Jack. Do not watch this movie unless you are white male. Watch if you are really curious, but it will be a waste of time
1	who's having a baby? BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies. she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like "sweet sixteen" or "breakfast club". Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day. Soundtrac is great with kate bush "the woman's work". My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played. i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife. boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever.
1	Great Movie! My girlfriend told me about this movie. Up until then I have never heard about it. This movie was alot better then I thought it would be. I enjoyed every minute of it. It kept me on my toes the entire time
1	inside look at afghanistan-a true storyline, wonderful a great story based on a real tale of one canadian/afghan womens journey back to afghanistan to search for her frined, who is depressed and contemplating suicide due to the opression and devastation all around. in the movie the friend is actually her sister. the main character relives her actual travels and shows you many things in afghanistan that contribute to the situation her friend is facing, such as hunger, death, robbery, oppression of women and their basic rights, religious fanaticism, etc... although she is not able to reach her destination of kandahar, either in real life or in the movie, the movie will show you the devastation the afghan people face day to day, and the lengths people go to survive. there are some comical moments, and some real heartfelt moments throughout. one of the best films made about afghanistan, and a true story to boot. directed by the great mohsen makhmalfbaf, if you buy this please view the commentary by the women in the film, it contains great info as to what the situation was like making the film, and her own personal story. also, the dvd contains a special news braodcast about her life, in canada and afghanistan
0	Take out your hunting knife and gut the book Never have I seen a movie violate a book so badly. John Grisham's Runaway Jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction, in which the widow of a life-long smoker takes on Big Tobacco in the courtroom. The movie Runaway Jury is a slapped-together suspense chase, in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers. This movie is, at most, a caricature of the book, and not a flattering one at that. Hackman transforms Fitch's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery; a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall. Parts of Marlee's life-altering past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events. The most interesting aspects of the story--jury selection and Nicholas Easter's manipulation of the court--are grudgingly presented in minute-long montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around. If I had never read the book, I would consider this a run-of-the-mill flick, rent-worthy at best. But knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad. Even if you aren't a lover of fiction, I highly recommend buying the book instead.
1	the o.c i am a very big fan of the o.c but i must admit that it is getting worse and worse i hate to say this cause really like it but i hope it gets better. whats making it worse is that A LOT is happening in one episode and the hero is always rayen. well lets hope for the best i cant wait for the next season since the finale was a real clif hanger
1	the book is better. The movie is still good. Pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of John Grisham and bring it all onto the screen. They do a pretty good job. Matt Damon plays Rudy, a student in law school who's smart, broke, and about to make history. In the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer. The policy covered it but they would just not pay. Meantime Damons character is in deeper than ever, as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out. Read the novel, then watch the movie. It's really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving. Danny DeVito plays Damons partner in the film and it's one of the better roles I've seen him play.
1	Surprising Gem in Gay Cinema!! When I first heard of this title I thought that it would be just another bad soft core porn video but I was very surprised to find that this movie was very good!! The movie starts with two guys just looking for sex and shows all the things that get in the way of their sex. By the end of the movie there looks to be a relationship there and you feel that it is not just about sex byt also love. The grin on your face is hard to wipe off after seeing this movie!! This is one gay flick that is worth checking out!
1	The best of the bunch I had watched the Bananas special with Jeff Allen on it, but I wanted to see more, so I bought this DVD. It had a little more funny stuff on it, but the serious talk he gave for a portion of the show was great too. This is a seriously funny man that you should check out. One of the best comedians I have ever seen
1	I disagree After reading the reviews above I decided to chime in with my two cents. Although I agree Joe Public may find this movie a bit dry and at times unrealistic I must say that this is an unfair assesment and that the film has it's audience. Currently I am working on my masters in Psychology and I must say that the depiction of an individual who is seriously considering suicide is far more accurate than most films today. Despite popular opinion, those who attempt suicide are rarely brudding goths who always see the more morbid side of things and listen to Metallica. They are generally normal people who just feel tired and lost, something that Paul Rudd brings across in spades. Although they seldom film their deaths, most suicide attempties do discuss killing themselves and are often aware of how "indulgent" it may seem to others, a point discussed in the film. Thus it is unfair to say that this movie is bad based on a half founded belief that the content is unrealistic
1	Unbelievable Acting and Cinematography - downright depressing though This movie is going to bring you down. That's a fact. But it's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves. A classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man. It's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the U Boat service
1	German Ingenuity If you would like to know how life was on a German Submarine in WW2, then this is the movie for you. It will keep you glued to your seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone who's interested in WW2 history and how the thoughts of German sailor's were not much different then our own.
0	Free to Be You and Me - As Long As You Are Like Me I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school. This video made its rounds in the public schools. The songs are catchy and the film quality is good. But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children. I will not be showing it to my kids. Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys. Case in point: Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse). She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time. Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first." The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron. The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal. Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting. There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby. Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror. Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry. Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children
0	Do We Really Need Movies Like This? From the opening line of "Bully" (in which 'Marty' explicitly mentions oral sex) I knew I wasn't going to like this film. Thank goodness I saw it on HBO and didn't waste my money on a rental. Once again, we have ANOTHER movie about dysfunctional upper-middle-class white families, in which the kids are a bunch of spoiled, drug-abusing, potty-mouthed brats, with parents that are nothing more than over-indulgent, inneffectual, clueless dolts. Wow, what a stretch for an "indie" film. Although this movie is based on a novelized "true" story by reporter Jim Schutze, about a murder that took place in Florida, the screenwriter and director seem only halfway interested into getting into the minds of the kids that committed this horrible crime, wasting the other half of the movie with scenes of gratuitous sex and full-frontal nudity that gives this movie the feel of a kiddie-porn flick that's intended to appeal to [...]. On top of that, the girl who instigated the murder was described in Shutze's book as chubby and plain, while the film makers took "artistic license" in their casting of cute, petite little Rachel Miner as Lisa. I guess the director figured that a chubby girl couldn't incite a good-looking young boy to kill for her, even though that's what happened in the book! Or perhaps the film makers wanted a pretty-looking young girl for all the teeneie nudity the role required. At the of the sleaze-fest is a violent murder, and director Larry Clark is uncompromising in his portrayal of the brutality of the act. Bobby (the 'bully') is reduced from a sadistic, foul-mouthed closet [...] to a screaming baby, begging for his life as he is repeatedly stabbed. Ultimately, his best friend Marty cuts his throat. Murder is a horrifying, messy act, and director Clark gives you a bird's-eye view of what a real murder may look like. This 5 minute scene should be clipped and shown to any kid that's considering committing such an awful act. It is truly hard to watch. Other than that, the film is just trash. Larry Clark could have effectively made all of his points without all the graphic sex, nudity, dirty language, and the [...] dildo scene in Bobby's bedroom. What hurts the film's believeability even more is the stereotypical treatment of the kids' parents as disconnected morons who act as unknowing enablers to these kids' rotten lifestyles. Liberal film-makers love to blame the parents, and not a pop culture environment that glorifies sex, drugs, and violence, teaching our kids disobedience, in spite of all that parents try to do to counteract this onslaught. The 5 minute scene portrying the murder of Bobby Kent should be used as part of a 'scared straight' program for wanna-be gangsters. The rest of the movie belongs in the dumpster. 'Nuff said'
0	Don't waste your money The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters. The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity. None of this appeared in the movie
0	murder she wrote--second season the disks in this set are double sided and there are problems. one or two of the episodes are unreadable. we returned the first set, which had an entire unreadable side on one of the cd's. the replacement was better, but not perfect. the single sided cd's in other sets are MUCH better and highly reliable as to quality. double sided just have built in flaws and i wish they would discontinue them.
0	waggy mcwaggster Man! this movie is soooooo boring. I literally slept through this movie. If I die not having watched it again ill be happy. i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs. old, but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr
0	Surprisingly slight and insubstantial The New World is the least of Terrence Malick's limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third. Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn't crop up.
0	Worst Service - Do not buy from these guys I only wish it were possible to give them no stars, or just red x's. These guys never shipped my order, and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then Amazon. Once that ship date came and went, I just made a claim to get my money back. A total of 2 months for DVD's that were meant for a father's day gift. These guys are clueless. Stay away from them for sure. You're better off going to Target to buy DVD's
1	Superb documentary What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void. The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it. Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.
0	No need to Suicide I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!? The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night. Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!? It is not matching the character
0	Worst movie I have ever seen... I really wish Amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars. This movie is nothing but anti-gun propaganda. I have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this, but it was like watching a train wreck...I just had to stay for the end. You know, for those of you who don't know...firearms SAVE far more innocent lives than they take every year, and mine was one of them. This movie CD might make a good coaster, but beyond that it is trash. Some less than truthful "NRA member" (yeah right) wrote..."I really liked and enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention. It will keep yours too, just give it a chance. Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible. I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching. However, I may add this to my collection!" HORSE HOCKEY. Member of the NRA? More like member of the Micheal Moore fan club. This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. They even had to LIE to get you in the theater, as nothing was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers! And saying that it was "a little bit slanted" is like saying Micheal Moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie!!
1	Love These Workouts!! This DVD is Great! I watched the first 2 seasons of the show so I could relate to the people in the video, because I saw how much weight they have lost, and how their lives have changed by getting fit. Those who have never seen the show can still relate to the participants because you can see that they are working hard and struggling also. I have lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks by eating healthy and doing this video daily. I mix n match work-outs each day.
0	ugh! I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!
1	Changed My Perceptions of Michael Moore I saw the last half hour of this movie on the Bravo network last week when I was actually looking for a rerun of "Project Runway," so my first exposure to it was the segment with K-Mart and the interview with Charlton Heston. Wow. I ended up being grateful "Project Runway" wasn't on. I made sure to catch "Bowling for Columbine" when Bravo ran it again, so I could see the whole thing. They showed it again last night. I have to say here that, prior to this, I'd never seen anything of Michael Moore's (except for one episode of "TV Nation") and had never had an interest in seeing any of his films because of all of the negative things I'd heard, including things Moore fans had raved about that I thought were negative, such as the way Moore confronts people in his films. What surprised me about "Bowling for Columbine" was what came across to me as Michael Moore's compassion. I really got the sense that he cared very deeply about people who lost their lives through gun violence as well as about people who lived in unfortunate circumstances. I have much greater respect for him than I had before I saw the film. His motivating factor doesn't seem to me to be so much political as moral. He truly is a moralist. He reminds me of the abolitionists of the nineteenth century that way. (Who an awful lot of people found annoying, if I need remind anyone.) For him, I don't think it's so much "Corporations and other powerful entities are evil" as "People not caring about other people--especially people not caring for those who are less fortunate--results in separation and hostility between people, which leads to evil." Well, shoot, they preach that in my church every Sunday. And, last time I checked, we weren't socialists. Also: I had heard, even from Moore fans, that his interview with Charlton Heston was unfortunate and embarrasing. But I don't agree. Why shouldn't he have asked Heston why he did what he did? Why on earth would Heston have gone to Denver and Flint after what happened? I just don't understand it. Some people said Heston was obviously suffering from Alzheimer's and incapable of carrying on the interview. He seemed entirely lucid to me. He was lucid enough to get up and walk away because he didn't want to answer the questions. Thank you, Michael Moore, for leaving Kayla Rolland's photo behind. Maybe Charlton Heston took it inside. Maybe it made some kind of difference. Peac
0	Disappointng I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it! The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up. I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration! I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine. In only broke my spirits! Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY! One of the worst workouts I have ever seen
0	I don't care so much about the foul language. I'm a big fan of The Sopranos so obviously the F word doesn't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the F word and MF. The stories and characters are superficial, boring and unintelligent. People who like this show are the same people who think that what makes The Sopranos a great show is because people get "whacked" a lot.
1	See how it began It's been 25 years and so much in the gay community has changed and so much hasn't. A quarter century ago it seemed unthinkable that Love and Death could ever co-exist. Now we live in the midst of an uneasy truce. See this film and see how the first generation dealt with the unthinkable
1	Wake Up! I think Orwell could almost sit up and cackle "I TOLD you so!" even as we gobble nachos and watch Monday night football (or PBS or Fox - doesn't matter). Between the propaganda we are fed by the Republican mercantilists or the Democratic marxists, there is little truth. Watch this film, then try to find a theater showing Aaron Russo's "America: From Freedom to Fascism". Then be afraid - but not for long. Get up and take action
1	Classic A movie with one good line after another, funny and interesting characters and lttle vignettes of hilareous bit part players. Just a great funny movi
0	Ludicrous! This DVD was probably the stupidest thing I have ever watched. There is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production. The water crystals are pretty ;-) but everything else about this production is complete nonsense
0	Typical rom-com for genre/bullock/affleck fans only If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell. Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning. Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle? The acting in this movie is "meh", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part. The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you. You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable.
0	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever! Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting
1	The American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1969, Vol. 3 Excellent, great camera work, very good sound and commentar
1	why we need birth control... i think this movie, although depressing, was a good example of the survival instinct manifested in children. Maybe in some sort of perverted way i thought that these children would become expert in the ways of survival, and that this experience could be a positive in their lives as they got older. These kids were being knoked around early in life and this, hopefully, would only make them stronger granting them a true picture of reality and the dog eat dog lifestyle of capitalism. These kids are a model for the capitalist system that encourages a rugged darwinian individualism. A part of me wishes that I would have spent a few years on the street like these kids (sans the Aurolac if possible). If anything we should admire these children for their incredible innocent strength...this is urban primitivism and liberty at its best especially when contrasted with those fat and ugly pampered Bucharetians chillin' at Sydney's cafe...
0	maybe it just hasn't aged well... ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film. I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity. but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth. take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better. so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one
1	Although very violent & graphic, this is an awesome movie Menace II Society is one of those films that leaves a powerful message that is not forgotten long after you have seen it. The story focuses on a teenage street thug who is caught in the middle of gang life and drugs but doesn't know how to escape it. After getting carjacked while cruising with his cousin on the streets of South Central LA, the main character swears revenge on the gangsters who killed his cousin. This movie is very violent and has a lot of language, but it should be shown to every teenager entering high school to show them what can happen if they decide to hook up with the wrong people and make the wrong choices in life. Although I did not like the ending very much, the impact of the film was very powerful and left quite an impact. It showed me that if you mess with the wrong people and don't take responsibility for your actions, you will get dealt with and quite possibly, killed. The main character gets murdered because he sleeps with some chick and gets her pregnant. She tells him, and he's like "What the heck are you telling me for? I had the plastic on extra tight." Condoms are not foolproof. They can slip and they can break. If you are gonna be with a woman for one night, make sure she is on something else, or pull out. The digital transfer to the DVD is first rate. The audio is outstanding in both the 2 channel Dolby Surround format as well as the 5.1 channel Digital tracks. Highs and lows are both top notch... Be sure to warn your neighbors if you have thin walls. I had sound complaints after I played this movie on my system! The bass from the subwoofer as well as the gunshots during the whole movie is so loud, you feel as if it is happening right in front of you. Amazing..
1	not just a good day it's a great day for da hood. i loved all three of em but unfortunately only own friday
0	Dumbest movie ever The entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false. The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents. Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them "again" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply. In movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK. But this is a mainstream legal thriller. It's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't, for no apparent reason. But the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is
1	Nice blend I enjoyed this workout. I love yoga for its awakening of the muscles and concentrated breathing, but it was my first experience with pilates. I enjoyed the mix because it gave my abs and biceps a workout, you get to reward your muscles w/nice stretches, and the 40 minutes went by quickly. I feel the pilates and yoga were blended well in this workout - great for beginner in either
1	Inexpensive Backstage Tour I rated this only four stars because the audio track on my DVD was out of sync with the video. It appears that the film to DVD transfer didn't compensate for the film audio being several frames ahead of the images. On the other hand I now have images of the Utilidors. I managed to take two backstage tours of Walt Disney World during the 1990's. The Keys to the Kingdom tour and the three-park Backstage Magic tour were expensive and took up an entire day--but I thought them worth the trouble and expense. It took me three years to book the Backstage Magic tour, and for several good reasons I didn't get to take home photographs of the backstage areas such as the Utilidors. Modern Marvels provided me video images to keep these vital infrastructure of Walt's utopian village fresh in my mind. I learned about the new Expedition Everest ride, and how the Tree of Life was grown by the Imagineers. I love the Monorail system and the Contemporary Resort--featured! This DVD lets me tour Walt Disney World and its secrets in the comfort of my home, without flying cross-country and putting up with crowds. It isn't "the real thing," but this DVD allows me to scratch my Walt Disney World itch until I get the time and a couple of thousand dollars to return to Orlando
0	Pretty stupid and obnoxious Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning. This is like a comic book for filmgoers. No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen. More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age. Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.
0	"Is this funny still? Yet? I honestly can't tell..." Seasons One, Two, Three: "Go Man, Go!" Season Four: the one to forego. Speaking as a fan who was first stupefied (amazed; astonished) by Bob and David back when they were the Kings of Megaphone Crooning ("People didn't want to hear songs about things that hadn't even been invented yet! They wanted to hear songs about NEW things."), that is, speaking as the rare fanatic, the rare "Mister Mr. Show" raising his voice on Amazon who laughs just as hard at the good G rated sketches as he does at the good NC-17 rated sketches, I find "Season Four" the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless MS sketches available in one package. Funnyguy Bob Odenkirk, reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life, says that Four was the season when "well-crafted" sketches were "in", "absurdity for absurdity's sake" was "out". No longer, he claims, was Mr. Show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers. Translation: they dumbed it down for the audience (and/or: horsing around in the writers' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat, facing the corner). Enticing as the term is, "well-crafted" here seems to mean "warmed over SNL type stuff", as in: spicing up the world's 1000th Jerry Springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat (momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is "funny" incongruity) and ladling on the same gay panic, the same class anxiety that makes the real Springer show such a howl. Overall, MS4's concepts become less novel, less thinky, less left-field-funny, with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true. What I mean is: a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor. But at least SGRH is a species of comedy. I haven't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies, and accounts for at least 75% of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts. Excelsior? (ex-cel-si-or (n.) Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing (originally a trademark)). This set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours. One, and only one, sketch makes me laugh out loud: the phenomenon of "Monster Parties" (as documented in novelty songs such as "Halloween Shindig", "Dracula's Pajama Party" and the like) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid TV grammar. Original, bent premise anchored by yet another simultaneously vicious and sympathetic David Cross performance. For the most part, the gang seems tired, like they're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny. Surely, anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass.
0	the impostors It was terrible! Lili played a good part of course. But the rest was just plain stupid
0	NOT DANCING If you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking. If you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again! This video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing "club" clothing instead of spandex. I was very disappointed with this purchase
1	Ah, Romance! My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of "healthy" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story.
0	Not too good for kids Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program. There are 6 & 10 years old, and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,- You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching & Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program.
1	The funniest show on TV The funniest dry humor on TV. The season just doesn't have enough episodes! But who are we kidding, I could watch these episodes again and again. My favorite- "The Alliance". ENJOY!
0	Can I Get Some Coffee Please! If there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was "History of Violence" On critics top ten list, everyone was talking about the performances of Viggo and Maria and Ed, so I went into it with high expectations. Honestly it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was "been there done that". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off. So I don't recommend this movie, its slow, its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be
0	Incoherent, passionless, garbage. I watched this movie and I have no idea what it was about. Admittedly it had the usual post-modern, post-Matrix action movie tropes, improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things (I'm a big fan of Charlize Theron in a sheer body suit), lots of explosions, a vast, behind the scenes conspiracy (well, that's kind of redundant, most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes) run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the Imperial Storm Troopers in Star Wars look like Marine snipers, but other than that what was this movie about? It's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes, throw them up against the wall, see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results. What comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand. "Aeon Flux" is "Plan 9 From Outer Space" with better looking actors and a huge production budget. Well no, it's not even that, say what you will about Ed Wood, he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them, but it's doubtful that anyone involved in "Aeon Flux" viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck, and it shows. Save your money, in a few years this will be on Showtime late at night as a replacement for "Beastmaster III" and if you're up late you can watch it then
1	Liquid TV Revisited This move gets my vote as I'm some one of the Liquid TV era I enjoyed see the animated Aeon take a real person roll. The movie leaves room for sequals as was the Idea with origonal animated version. Hopefully there will be more to come. She's hot for being as dressed as she is compared to the origonal animation. The Science Fantacy special affect were new and innovative without being dark in it violence. It would be nice if MTV was still as entertaining as Aeon
1	Civil War Great movie, great actors for such a sad part of the U.S. history ! It is great to see in this movie some men who really existed (especially "Stonewall" Jackson). We don't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction, but at the end of the day it's not very important, because the historical interest is preserved
0	terrible this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures. The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this) This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinio
1	Truly Amazing! I have been a Firm Believer for a couple years now and this video still kicks my butt! Everytime I do this video my thighs and fanny are so sore the next day that it hurts to sit! If you want fast results you can see and feel then this is the video for you! Jen Carmen is very motivating and tough. There is no quitting with her. She makes you want finish this workout.
1	Haven't seen it yet I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody
0	Cliched story, inferior animation. We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke... Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry.
1	The World of Crossword Puzzles Explored - Good Stuff For me, crossword puzzles have been a casual thing, I might find one in the airline magazine on a flight and work on it to pass the time or my wife, who is a much more avid fan, might have left a partially finished one about, which I will pick up and see if I can find some answers. Those who appear in this movie find crossword puzzles to be anything but casual. And this is not about just any crossword puzzle. This is the "gold standard." The NYT crossword puzzle. You may genuflect if you wish. As the movie unfolds we hear how the NYT graduates the difficulty of its puzzles from Monday to Sunday. We learn how they are constructed, how they are made more difficult, what the rules of puzzle building are and how crossword puzzles infect and afflict those who are addicted to them. Celebrities from Ken Burns to Jon Stweart are utilized in cameo pieces, some of which are very entertaining. This all culminates in the Marriott Hotel in Stamford, CT where the World Crossword Puzzle Championship takes place every year in March. We meet some of the contestants, we are shown how the tournament is organized and the friendships it has engendered during the years it has been held and as the days pass we get to the "A" finals where three finalists try to solve a puzzle against time on large easels set up at the front of the room which will really draws you in to the genre. Whether crossword puzzles are your thing or not, this is an entertaining and interesting movie to see. It did not encourage me to increase my crossword puzzle activity, but it sure gave me a deeper appreciation of what those who are hooked on it go through. There is something in this movie for everyone.
0	claptrap That which is original in this program is biased and untrue. That which is true is not original. This piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship, such as "Rats, Lice, and History" by Hans Zinsser. It makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating. Diamond's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous. National Geographic has sunk to new lows to screen this
1	Great Movie! This is a great movie. This movie has some sexual references, but no nudity. There is some profanity but definitely a funny movie that is geared to older children about 14 and up.
1	Great workout W/ variations This DVD is a great addition to my colletction! I am able to vary my workout and feel challenged! The instructor is knowledgable, easy to listen to, and explains the moves in detail. There are so many workouts to choose from- it gives you many choices (so you're not bored) So glad I bought it!! You do need a few prop
0	The guys can't act I'm not a professional critic or one that watches many movies. I just love 80's movies and since this movie had good reviews, I had to watch it. I was so dissapointed with the nerd and the rebel's bad acting in the movie; It was just horrible! I like the storyline and the soundtrack, but the acting really ruined everything. If you just want to watch it to see some skin and not for good quality acting, then this is your movie
1	CSI CONTINUES TO SHINE Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically. In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises: Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self. We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more. The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television. Brilliant show just keeps getting better
1	A Sexy, Exciting Thriller Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in this action-packed thriller about a rather unorthodox married couple who have very unique occupations. Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith. Both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage. Jane works with computers, while John works as an architect with his friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn). They have dinner each night at 7 pm, and neither has much to say. They live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors. But in reality, there is much more than meets the eye. Unbeknownst to each other, both are cooly lethal, highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations. They are both assigned the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody). Both John and Jane show up at the intercept point, but in reality, Benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both John and Jane. The organizations have found out that the two are married, and there are orders to kill both of them. Jane soon discovers that John was the one who foiled her attempt to get Benjamin, now she has set her sights on taking out her husband. What happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive. Will John manage to escape from his wife? Will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle? Will John and Jane join forces to save each other? I thought this was a very good movie. The story is very well-conceived. There are lots of action scenes, along with guns, knives, explosives, and narrow escapes. There's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are perfect together, and the film will keep you on your toes throughout. I highly recommend this action-packed movie. This movie gives new meaning to "till death do us part".
1	7 million dollars at box office-No one was there to see this movie The Man Who Wasn't There is a movie by the always unpredictable Coen brothers. Their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it's fun to see what they've come up with next. Out of the ones I've seen, my thoughts are mixed. I mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like Raising Arizona, then one of the best movies of all time with Fargo and then go terribly wrong from there? Then you've got the Big Lebowski, a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness. Not what I call a good movie. Then there's the Ladykillers, a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything. So they're just getting worse by age, right? Wait! Let's go back two years to 2001. It was in this year that this unheard of movie was made. Of course, its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle. And that's the beauty of this gem. The cinematography. The look of this world and the 1940s feel it's good is brilliant. But it's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own. It is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others. But first, let's talk about the plot of the movie. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) is living in California in the 40s with his wife, Doris (Frances McDormand). Doris is part of a community that talks and talks. But not Ed. Ed narrates this story...his story. He sees it in black and white or maybe that's the way it really is. You've got to think. Ed is a barber and is proud of his job. He only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration. So here, there is some more originality, brilliance and beauty. When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini), he reacts with harshness. He blackmails Big Dave but something goes wrong. Big Dave finds out and Ed kills him out of defense. And this all happens in the first 30 minutes. Doris is accused of doing it and from then on, you're in for a real treat. When Ed isn't narrating, like I already said, he isn't talking. So what he does is smoke, cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed Birdy (Scarlett Johansson) play piano. Her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty. Tony Shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider. He's a big shot who talks and talks. Keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the "you don't know" repeated a bunch of times. Believe me, you'll know when you're hearing it. The movie is a sad and tragic tale, a tale showing how badly one man's life can go in a world that isn't for him. He's different. It's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one...he stands out because he's different. The Man Who Wasn't There is hands down an excellent movie. It is a close second to Fargo in the Coen's movies. My last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves. This movie is rated R for a scene of violence? Is that a joke? That scene was in black and white and showed NOTHING! You people really have no idea what you're doing. Pulp Fiction (R)=The Man Who Wasn't There (R) Get it straight people, your ratings are horrid. James Bond flicks have worse content than this.
0	All lies, an attack on america... For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man. Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times! In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie. Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame. Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.
1	Does the field of intention love nature? The Power of Intention is both inspiring and troubling. As an environmental and social activist who lives off of less the 10k per year, I was wondering as I read this book if I was holding in my hands what was once an Ancient Tree? Our Ancient Ancestors are being clear cut at an alarming rate in the Pacific Northwest. Most will go extinct in our lifetimes. Corporations continue to consolidate their political power in both mainstream parties: Democrat and Republican alike enact legislation on behalf of corporations that will open what is left of these ancient giants to clear-cutting. Stories will be told of these trees on day, perhaps even to our own grandchildren beginning with the words, "Once upon a time there was a great and majestic forest." Your Democratic and Republican representatives are now organizing the last Buffalo hunt. You can still have your voice be heard on behalf of these ancient trees before it is too late. On page 48 of his book Mr. Dyer makes the following observation, "Practice kindness toward the Earth by picking up a piece of litter that's on your path, or saying a silent prayer of gratitude for the existence of rain, the color of flowers, or even the paper you hold in your hand that was donated by a tree." Sadly, Mr. Dyer's observation is confused. The paper we hold in our hands is produced by multi-national corporations on public lands administered by bureaucrats marching to one tune: politicians who accept large gratuities in the form of moneyed transactions so favorable legislation opens these national treasures to exploitation. This book review is offered as a creative challenge to Mr. Dyer to connect to the field of intention on behalf of non-sentient life. Hopefully, the field of intention extends the same beneficence to the astonishing field of nature, not in a fashion that promotes anthropocentrism and narcissism, but rather amplifies the web of life and its connections to human life so that a win-win situation is advocated rather than diminished. This begs the question: is the book worth the $24.95 I paid to read it? I suppose that if the field of intention can be tapped into for the benefit of our Earth Mother, my answer is yes! If, on the other hand, the spiritual principles are used only for generating prosperity for the self alone, then the $24.95 would be better spent planting a tree to help offset the expense of Mr. Dyer's next best seller.
0	STUPID PACKAGING & SHAMEFUL OFFER When you receive this set, they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf, for an additional $2.98. What arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder. 20th Century Fox Entertainment should be boycotted. They make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely 8 cents - all in addition to the original cost of the discs. I love THE SIMPSONS, but I am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case
0	Warning: This is What will Happen if Gay Marriage Goes Nationwide!!!! Just kidding. Actually, Massachusetts has nothing to worry about. The people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as Martians would (an effect Fellini was deliberately going for). The only reason I rented this disc is because John Lennon once said that the Beatles' life on tour was like Fellini's Satyricon. I can only hope that the Fab Four's nights in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan were more fun than this movie. More a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative, Satyricon (just how does one pronounce it anyway?) bets eveything on its visuals. Some work and are impressive, but after a half hour, even diehard film buffs will tire of watching Fellini try to top himself every five minutes. I hated Fellini's La Dolce Vita. But, being a good sport, I decided to give the famed Italian director one more shot by watching this. I don't think I want to go for strike three anytime soon. One could pretty much watch the scenes in any order. As an added annoyance, it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming, just like they did in the spaghetti Westerns. Since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists, one only has imagery to go on. So, let me describe the movie in montage form. We see large slabs of meat, bonfires, fat pedophiles, fat homosexuals, thin homosexuals, a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice, an annoying poet with a beautiful voice. There are midgets, galley slaves, oily wrestling matches, a sweaty Minotaur, heads chopped off, mutilations, suicides, a man swinging from a noose, lots of froliking, little real sex and no eroticism, an earthquake, sabers, Centaurians, dusty vistas, squeaky wagons, a pasty-faced demi-god, painted woman, painted men, loin cloths, art work, and as Cosmo Kramer once said, lots of unbridled enthusiasm. What does it all add up to? Two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted. If you want great imagery in a foreign film, stick with Werner Herzog's work.

1	Better than the others I bought this movie last year on a hum bug. This movie really surprised me. I really enjoyed it. My daughters love it as well. We watch it constantly and the soundtrack is awesome too
1	Gov't of the Lobbyists, by the Lobbyists, and for the Lobbyists "The Big Buy" may not have the slick gloss of other documentaries, but the content is invaluable in understanding how American democracy has been hijacked. Birnbaum and Schermbeck show how Tom DeLay deliberately reengineered the electoral system to create an incestuous alliance of lobbyists and government officials on a scale not seen before in American politics. This culture of corruption demands business representatives pay thousands of dollars for access to politicians -- akin to practices normally associated with self-serving Third World governments. In the meantime, the interests of average Americans are shunted aside. The documentary cautions that, even though DeLay has had to step down, others of his ilk have replaced him and are carrying on his legacy. Another outstanding source revealing the magnitude of corruption that has taken hold is PBS's Bill Moyers on America. The first episode, "Capitol Crimes," connects the dots regarding Jack Abramoff, Tom DeLay, Grover Norquist and others who brought an agenda to D.C. to buy out Congress with a view to creating a permanent Republican Congress whose power derives from monies given to it by big business. One definition of Fascism is a government aligned in partnership with corporate businesses. "The Big Buy" shows how Tom DeLay has created that model for American in the 21st century. It begs the question -- as we now try to export democracy to other countries -- can we claim to be democracy anymore
0	Spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell. Isn't stalking hilarious? And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen? I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby. I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends". To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok." Wow. Now that's drama.
0	Sugar Coated Luther... I see a lot of positive reviews posted here... The historical Luther will not be found in this movie. No doubt the audience is predominantly Lutheran. From a secular entertainment point of view, I would agree with them. 4 Stars. The attention to detail is excellent; it is well acted, well written, well casted. However, director Eric Till has made Luther into a hero. He was no hero. History reveals the truth that is so glaringly absent in the film. The only thing that rang true was that Luther was an anti-establishment, religious zealot reformer, just like Jesus, (only Jesus hated gentiles, calling them "dogs and swine)." I challenge Till to make a "Luther Part 2," using excerpts of Luther's OWN WORDS below as the script. It smack's of a Hitler biography/// . Disclaimer: If you are Lutheran, brace yourself. He blatently advocated a slow genocide of the Jews. Hitler picked up on what Luther was throwin' down... "The Jewish vermin... shall have their homes razed... curfews set... business banned..." etc. This is the Luther that is never portrayed. Ad hominem or not, how can Lutheranism be trusted when it's founder was such a hateful individual? The Jews and Their Lies, by Martin Luther "I had made up my mind to write no more either about the Jews or against them. But since I learned that these miserable and accursed people do not cease to lure to themselves even us, that is, the Christians, I have published this little book, so that I might be found among those who opposed such poisonous activities of the Jews who warned the Christians to be on their guard against them. I would not have believed that a Christian could be duped by the Jews into taking their exile and wretchedness upon himself. However, the devil is the god of the world, and wherever God's word is absent he has an easy task, not only with the weak but also with the strong. May God help us. Amen. He did not call them Abraham's children, but a "brood of vipers" [Matt. 3:7]. Oh, that was too insulting for the noble blood and race of Israel, and they declared, "He has a demon' [Matt 11:18]. Our Lord also calls them a "brood of vipers"; furthermore in John 8 [:39,44] he states: "If you were Abraham's children ye would do what Abraham did.... You are of your father the devil. It was intolerable to them to hear that they were not Abraham's but the devil's children, nor can they bear to hear this today. Therefore the blind Jews are truly stupid fools... Now just behold these miserable, blind, and senseless people. ...their blindness and arrogance are as solid as an iron mountain. Learn from this, dear Christian, what you are doing if you permit the blind Jews to mislead you. Then the saying will truly apply, "When a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into the pit" [cf. Luke 6:39]. You cannot learn anything from them except how to misunderstand the divine commandments... Therefore be on your guard against the Jews, knowing that wherever they have their synagogues, nothing is found but a den of devils in which sheer self-glory, conceit, lies, blasphemy, and defaming of God and men are practiced most maliciously and veheming his eyes on them. Moreover, they are nothing but thieves and robbers who daily eat no morsel and wear no thread of clothing which they have not stolen and pilfered from us by means of their accursed usury. Thus they live from day to day, together with wife and child, by theft and robbery, as arch-thieves and robbers, in the most impenitent security. However, they have not acquired a perfect mastery of the art of lying; they lie so clumsily and ineptly that anyone who is just a little observant can easily detect it. But for us Christians they stand as a terrifying example of God's wrath. If I had to refute all the other articles of the Jewish faith, I should be obliged to write against them as much and for as long a time as they have used for inventing their lies-- that is, longer than two thousand years. ...Christ and his word can hardly be recognized because of the great vermin of human ordinances. However, let this suffice for the time being on their lies against doctrine or faith. Did I not tell you earlier that a Jew is such a noble, precious jewel that God and all the angels dance when he farts? Alas, it cannot be anything but the terrible wrath of God which permits anyone to sink into such abysmal, devilish, hellish, insane baseness, envy, and arrogance. If I were to avenge myself on the devil himself I should be unable to wish him such evil and misfortune as God's wrath inflicts on the Jews, compelling them to lie and to blaspheme so monstrously, in violation of their own conscience. Anyway, they have their reward for constantly giving God the lie. No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants. ...but then eject them forever from this country. For, as we have heard, God's anger with them is so intense that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse and worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little. Therefore, in any case, away with them! Over and above that we let them get rich on our sweat and blood, while we remain poor and they suck the marrow from our bones. I brief, dear princes and lords, those of you who have Jews under your rule-- if my counsel does not please your, find better advice, so that you and we all can be rid of the unbearable, devilish burden of the Jews, lest we become guilty sharers before God in the lies, blasphemy, the defamation, and the curses which the mad Jews indulge in so freely and wantonly against the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, this dear mother, all christians, all authority, and ourselves. Do not grant them protection, safe-conduct, or communion with us.... .With this faithful counsel and warning I wish to cleanse and exonerate my conscience. Let the government deal with them in this respect, as I have suggested. But whether the government acts or not, let everyone at least be guided by his own conscience and form for himself a definition or image of a Jew. However, we must avoid confirming them in their wanton lying, slandering, cursing, and defaming. Nor dare we make ourselves partners in their devilish ranting and raving by shielding and protecting them, by giving them food, drink, and shelter, or by other neighborly acts. Therefore we Christians, in turn, are obliged not to tolerate their wanton and conscious blasphemy. Accordingly, it must and dare not be considered a trifling matter but a most serious one to seek counsel against this and to save our souls from the Jews, that is, from the devil and from eternal death. What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews? Since they live among us, we dare not tolerate their conduct, now that we are aware of their lying and reviling and blaspheming. If we do, we become sharers in their lies, cursing and blaspemy. Thus we cannot extinguish the unquenchable fire of divine wrath, of which the prophets speak, nor can we convert the Jews. With prayer and the fear of God we must practice a sharp mercy to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames. We dare not avenge ourselves. Vengeance a thousand times worse than we could wish them already has them by the throat. I shall give you my sincere advice: First to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them. This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, and blaspheming of his Son and of his Christians. For whatever we tolerated in the past unknowingly - and I myself was unaware of it - will be pardoned by God. But if we, now that we are informed, were to protect and shield such a house for the Jews, existing right before our very nose, in which they lie about, blaspheme, curse, vilify, and defame Christ and us (as was heard above), it would be the same as if we were doing all this and even worse ourselves, as we very well know. Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies. This will bring home to them that they are not masters in our country, as they boast, but that they are living in exile and in captivity, as they incessantly wail and lament about us before God. Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them... Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb. For they have justly forfeited the right to such an office by holding the poor Jews captive with the saying of Moses (Deuteronomy 17 [:10 ff.]) in which he commands them to obey their teachers on penalty of death, although Moses clearly adds: "what they teach you in accord with the law of the Lord." Those villains ignore that. They wantonly employ the poor people's obedience contrary to the law of the Lord and infuse them with this poison, cursing, and blasphemy. In the same way the Pope also held us captive with the declaration in Matthew 16 [:18], "You are Peter," etc., inducing us to believe all the lies and deceptions that issued from his devilish mind. He did not teach in accord with the word of God, and therefore he forfeited the right to teach. Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside, since they are not lords, officials, tradesmen, or the like. Let they stay at home... Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them and put aside for safekeeping. The reason for such a measure is that, as said above, they have no other means of earning a livelihood than usury, and by it they have stolen and robbed from us all they possess. Such money should now be used in no other way than the following: Whenever a Jew is sincerely converted, he should be handed one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred florins, as personal circumstances may suggest. With this he could set himself up in some occupation for the support of his poor wife and children, and the maintenance of the old or feeble. For such evil gains are cursed if they are not put to use with God's blessing in a good and worthy cause. Seventh, I commend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children of Adam (Gen 3[:19]}. For it is not fitting that they should let us accursed Goyim toil in the sweat of our faces while they, the holy people, idle away their time behind the stove, feasting and farting, and on top of all, boasting blasphemously of their lordship over the Christians by means of our sweat. No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants. But what will happen even if we do burn down the Jews' synagogues and forbid them publicly to praise God, to pray, to teach, to utter God's name? They will still keep doing it in secret. If we know that they are doing this in secret, it is the same as if they were doing it publicly. For our knowledge of their secret doings and our toleration of them implies that they are not secret after all and thus our conscience is encumbered with it before God. Accordingly, it must and dare not be considered a trifling matter but a most serious one to seek counsel against this and to save our souls from the Jews, that is, from the devil and from eternal death. My advice, as I said earlier, is: First, that their synagogues be burned down, and that all who are able toss in sulphur and pitch; it would be good if someone could also throw in some hellfire. That would demonstrate to God our serious resolve and be evidence to all the world that it was in ignorance that we tolerated such houses, in which the Jews have reviled God, our dear Creator and Father, and his Son most shamefully up till now but that we have now given them their due reward. I wish and I ask that our rulers who have Jewish subjects exercise a sharp mercy toward these wretched people, as suggested above, to see whether this might not help (though it is doubtful). They must act like a good physician who, when gangrene has set in, proceeds without mercy to cut, saw, and burn flesh, veins, bone, and marrow. Such a procedure must also be followed in this instance. Burn down their synagogues, forbid all that I enumerated earlier, force them to work, and deal harshly with them, as Moses did in the wilderness, slaying three thousand lest the whole people perish. They surely do not know what they are doing; moreover, as people possessed, they do not wish to know it, hear it, or learn it. There it would be wrong to be merciful and confirm them in their conduct. If this does not help we must drive them out like mad dogs, so that we do not become partakers of their abominable blasphemy and all their other vices and thus merit God's wrath and be damned with them. I have done my duty. Now let everyone see to his. I am exonerated." My essay, I hope, will furnish a Christian (who in any case has no desire to become a Jew) with enough material not only to defend himself against the blind, venomous Jews, but also to become the foe of the Jews' malice, lying, and cursing, and to understand not only that their belief is false but that they are surely possessed by all devils. May Christ, our dear Lord, convert them mercifully and preserve us steadfastly and immovably in the knowledge of him, which is eternal life. [1]
1	Another pearl from Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming and David Silver Having owned the videotape of this offering from Dr. Yang, I was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the DVD. I was very satisfied with the information offered on the VHS tape, but having already owned the material, it didn't make sense to purchase a DVD unless there was something added to the material. Generally, when a company releases a DVD of a previously released VHS tape, there is very little added to the DVD release. Fortunately, in line with the high quality of YMAA publications, this DVD has approximately two hours of material that was not on the original VHS. Combine this with the ease of access that a DVD offers and the Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style DVD becomes even more of a bargain. The video offers material and instruction for the following: The Taijiquan Thirteen Postures The Fundamental 8 Stances Taiji Qigong, with stretching and three sets taught The Yang Style Taijiquan sequence (The long form) The video also has an extensive lecture on Taijiquan Theory by Dr. Yang as well as a demonstration of Fa Jing and a list of all the movements of the long form. The lecture is vital to anyone who wants to learn Taijiquan. Merely imitating the postures and movements, which sadly is how many people practice Taijiquan, without an understanding of the philosophy from which Taijiquan developed, would severely limit one's experience. Dr. Yang discusses how Taiji is between Wuji (nothingness) and yin and yang. This concept is extremely important and vital to the performance and practice of Taijiquan. When you begin the form, you should stand in a beginning posture which represents Wuji, or nothingness/emptiness, during which you settle the body, relax the breath and bring all the parts of your body and mind into this Wuji state. Then the thought/intention is born in the mind and the Taiji (which came from the Wuji) splits into the yin and yang. The dead hands and body, maximum yin, become alive and slowly inflate and expand to a balance between maximum yin and maximum yang, along with the whole body. Now the form begins. I see many practitioners walk up, stand still for one second and leap into the form without any understanding of where yin and yang spring from. The transition from Wuji to Taiji to the interplay of yin and yang is one of the more fulfilling and engaging aspects of Taijiquan. Dr. Yang points out that Taiji, the theory of which is explained so well in this video, has been around for approximately four thousand years, whereas Taijiquan has been around for perhaps a thousand years. The use of this theory in Daoism is also explained by Dr. Yang. The link between Taijiquan and Daoism through their mutual use of the philosophy of Taiji was one of the initial reasons for my interest in learning Taijiquan. Dr. Yang goes on to illustrate through the use of scientific formulas the relationship of Taijiquan and the laws of physics. This lecture is just the preparation to begin to use the other parts of the video. Too many times tapes are presented by martial artists with little thought for tying it all together and explaining the meaning of what is offered. This video is extremely well thought out and presents the viewer with a strategic approach that will enable them to go far in their quest to learn Taijiquan. Throughout the video there are visual clues as to when to inhale and when to exhale while doing the form or the Taijiquan Qigong. The demonstration of the long form offers detailed instructions when you click on the yin-yang symbol. I would have to write a ten page review to give justice to all the material presented on this DVD. A wonderful addition to Dr. Yang's presentations and a worthwhile purchase even if you already own the VHS version of this video.
1	The STRONG should PROTECT the WEAK--or slaying the "judicial/bureaucratic" Goliaths! Paul Newman is great as a despairing, alcoholic "David", once second in his law class, once part of a prestigious law firm, once married...till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury. The above is past history...just mentioned in the film. It is some years after, and alcoholic Newman, with only 4 cases in the last few years, ...has an epiphany...where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens as he gets the picture, so to speak, of a woman treated unjustly, whom he can help. He forgets himself and his troubles, and the people who have pushed him around, ...and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman...against the hospital and doctors who damaged her. He will later awaken the conscience (as the movie hints) of one of the "Goliaths" he goes up against. However, there are pitfalls... as opposing lawyer Concannon is not above using any trick---or person...to destroy the case. Paul Newman's epiphany scene (which I won't describe further to spoil it for you, but which is clearly recognizable) is quite moving. His Goliaths include: The biased, hostile Judge, the "Prince of Darkness" superlawyer Concannon (played well by James Mason, always good at suave villians), the doctors and **most** of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate Deborah Ann Kaye, ...and the somewhat hesitant Bishop Brophy, head of St. Catherine's, the hospital where Mrs. Kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage. Set in Boston, a largely Catholic city (I am told) we here have nominal Catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the Christian "Good Samaritan" story seriously. My family caution: There are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene. The Verdict implies the barely seen 12 who also are key players...the jury, who must deliver the verdict. Will they go with the letter of the law? Or---its spirit? (If you are familiar with this phrase from the Christian faith, you have the answer...) (Hint of spoiler below) My wish is that brain injured Terri Schiavo had had a jury who could see the spirit of the law! Instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a Congress that dared (how DARE they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude) to merely ask for a second look at the whole case. Meanwhile, Terri slowly starved to death...Shame on us! Shades of Nazi Eugenics!!!
0	This film was not faithful to the adaptation of the novel. There's lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK, but it's mostly emotional. It's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master. The film on the other hand is just your classic, bad 1990s film, beautiful to look at, with lots of skin, languid copulation, heaving bosoms, bodice-ripping nonsense, etc and next to no substance. It has no artistic integrity whatsoever, as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did. I was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character. The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe, and it also lacked much enthusiasm. They were incomplete and contributed little, if anything, to the plot. The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette. Therefore, they should have either gone all the way, tastefully (no pun intended), or have left those scenes out entirely. Now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes, which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book. But for those who haven't read the book, there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat. From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family (despite the narration). Why did the ex-slaves keep laughing? (Something vaguely explained in the movie, though apparently fully explained in the book). Why didn't the parrot fly away? What made the mother go nuts? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester's "issues", as it were, fully explained. The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato, after (as Christophene explains) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place. What a hypocrite. Again, maybe this is the ultimate point, that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans. But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film. So, despite the beautiful cinematography, this movie is a hopeless muddle. I'd highly recommend the novel by the way: a book you don't forget in a hurry. Needless to say I think you should give this insulting (to the memory of Jean Rhys) film a miss, especially if you've read the novel: it'll just frustrate you, no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time.
1	Iconographic Performances In Memorable Comedy-Drama MGM's 1932 GRAND HOTEL, which featured an all-star cast in a series of interweaving plotlines set against a glamorous Berlin hotel, was a tremendous success, and the studio wasted no time in acquiring DINNER AT EIGHT, a popular Broadway show by George S. Kauffman and Edna Ferber that had much the same concept and which could be given the same all-star treatment. When New York society matron and relentless social climber Millicent Jordan has the opportunity to host a dinner for members of the English aristocracy, she determines to go all out--and the film follows the lives of her soon-to-be guests over the course of a week. Millicent (Billie Burke) is unaware that husband Oliver (Lionel Barrymore) faces both a business and medical crisis. Oliver's friend Carlotta (Marie Dressler), a stage star of yesteryear, has sold her stock in Oliver's company--which allows loudmouth business tycoon Dan Packard (Wallace Beery) the chance to cash in at Oliver's expense. By coincidence, Packard's wife Kitty (Jean Harlow) is having an affair with Oliver's doctor, Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe)--and if this were not complication enough, Oliver and Millicent's daughter Paula (Madge Evans) is on the verge of provoking a social scandal via an affair with aging and alcoholic movie star Larry Renault (John Barrymore.) And all of them are invited to dine. DINNER AT EIGHT is usually described as a comedy, and it is true that there are several notable comic performances. The most famous of these are Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow, who give outrageous performances as the bickering Packards; Billie Burke and Marie Dressler also score as the harried hostess and the retired actress whose charms are long gone. Where comedy is concerned, DINNER AT EIGHT plays extremely, extremely well and can hold its own with even the best of 1930s comedy--but in truth the movie is more of a drama than a comedy, and where drama is concerned it shows its age in no uncertain terms. For one thing, the script relies a great deal on coincidence. This adds to the fun where comedy is concerned, but it works less well for drama, and in DINNER AT EIGHT the neatness with which the parallel plots link to each other is a bit too pat. For antoher thing, there is a clash of style between the film's comic and dramatic moments, most particularly in terms of the John Barrymore sequences, where the acting seems excessively stagey. Instead of seamless, the various elements tend butt against each other in a slightly awkward way. Even so, and whether your taste runs to acid-tongued comedy, broad melodrama, or wild farce, DINNER AT EIGHT offers a great deal to enjoy. The performances are first rate, with the comic moments a true delight; there is dark irony in John Barrymore's performance; and the set designs and costuming are nothing short of iconographic: it is impossible to think of Jean Harlow, for instance, without envisioning her against a white-on-white Modern bedroom--and that, and a great deal more, comes straight out of this film. Although the film has not been remastered, the print and sound are extremely good, and bonus features include a very good documentary on Jean Harlow, who more or less steals the show from her numerous co-stars. Recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewe
0	George later hated this series.... It's a little known fact but George Peppard later said in interviews that he hated this series, frequently did not get along with his co-stars (particularly Mr.T) and hate the child scripts that Stephen Candell would turn out each week. It's easy to see why, Two of the actors; Mr.T and Dirk Benedict really could not act and did not work on anything big after this show fizziled out in 1985. Dwight Schultz did continue to work and turned up in supporting roles in various TV movies and films, so he at least had some acting talent to speak of, but really the only real star of this series was George Peppard, and his more memmorial TV work should be as the Private Insurance investigator, Benecheck.
1	great way to break up your exercise routine! This DVD offers a nice twist to traditional Pilates movements. There are a lot of lunges that really get your heart rate up. Results were noticable in just a few sessions. A must have for your collection!
0	Shallow This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill. Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances. Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly). I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates. Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses. People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it. For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale.
0	Fails to come to a boil Laura Esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate,magical novel. Lumi Cavazos is a likeable Tita,struggling with her forbidden passion for Pedro.She's a sympathetic character&conveys her pain with her eyes.For a talented actress,I wonder what has become of her since. Marco Leonardi is not as sympathetic as Pedro.He comes across as a cheating scoundrel,causing pain for both his wife&his forbidden lover.One wonders why Tita loves him so much,except that it's forbidden.Marco Leonardi is,however,being true to the book.He uses Tita for his own pleasure;instead of bravely marrying her,he is a coward in marrying her sister&cheating on her. The movie renders less magical,or powerful,the scenes in the book.Instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti Western.One expects to see John Wayne riding to Tita's rescue. The magical scenes are hardly convincing,even for their time.The movie does have an excellent soundtrack.It's far inferior to the delectable,sensual novel
0	Not Even Worth Finishing Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it
0	What in the Hell is this? this deserves no stars what so ever! One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed
0	Could not get this to play I purchased this DVD, and could not get it to play in my DVD player. I sent it back for exchange, and received another identical disk that it too would not play. I sent it back for a refund, and was never able to view it. I never thought to try it in my computer, bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue. Oddly, the DVD has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all DVD players in the US..
1	Pop culture classic One of the greatest teen movies of all times. If you were in high school during the 80s, you've seen it. The movie is real, funny and a timeless classic. I must admit there is a bit of a lull about 3/4 through, after the abortion, but other than that the movie is perfect. If you haven't seen it lately, check it out and you'll start to remember high school again like it was yesterday. Need more - check out the book.
0	Elizabeth the Silly School Girl A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong. Why not just make up a story with no historical basis
1	super workout this is a great one- gets your muscles working!!! I alternate between this one and the "Crunch- cardio sculpt" on my off days from the gym- a well-worth it effort & a decent workout for 30 minutes
0	Welles has lost it Orson Welles was a master of film. But not this film. While I appreciate the message he is trying to convey, his "cleverness" is off the deep end. This film is like a big ego-trip for Welles. He's so proud of how clever he is. But the film is a mess, like paranoid, disjointed ramblings. In his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style. Clever is most clever when it is not obvious. In this film he beats you over the head with the "subtext" and thinks he's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line. I'm sorry I wasted my time to watch it. I would have turned it off, but given my high respect for Welles, I continued, expecting a revelation or twist. Alas, no, it was just a stupid movie
0	The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed... The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed... For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment. The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV. They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs. The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released
0	"Who would want to kill the sweetest ****** woman in the world?" I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?" The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS. But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack
1	Utterly amazing thriller! Wow! This movie really exceeded my expectations. Unfortunately, this movie does not get the credit it so much deserves. Berry put one of her best performances into this film. The plot is superb, the scenes are very convincing, and the plot-twist at the end is brilliant! This movie is much better than your average thriller and one of my favorites that I have seen in the past few years. This movie is void of predictability or any formulaic format, which makes it such a refreshing thriller. Don't listen to the negative reviews on this film, they don't know what they're talking about! Remember: If you see this movie with a friend, make sure you can hold on tight to him/her because you'll need someone
0	Couldn't have destroyed the story worse... I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming. But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you. See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack. They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart. They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully. It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality. Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player. And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile. SO. NOT. FORNEY. I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life. That horrid. And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role. Hello...?!?! Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too. Read the book, don't watch the movie. You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story
1	Came because of Sela Ward. Stayed because it was a phenomenal show There are very few shows in my lifetime that I have been fiercely loyal to, but the now defunct `Once and Again' without question, topped that short list. I will admit that my lifelong crush on actress Sela Ward was my main interest in this series, originally. Single, with no kids, and in my late 20s during O&A's debut, I was far out of ABC's target demographic for this show. I didn't expect to like the show very much, but I got sucked in not because of Sela, but because the show was nothing less than fantastic. Superbly acted and superbly written, ABC never gave this show a chance to find its audience, and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it's all too early demise. Even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance. The premise of the story is of Rick Samler and Lily Manning, two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces. They fall head over heels for one another, and find that life and love in the (then) late 1990s is far different than what they remember. Adding children, careers, parents, and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for Rick and Lily. Most shows `jump the shark' at some point during their lifetimes. While some could argue that the hostage episode in S2 was that point for O&A, I disagree. Once and Again always presented two kinds of television : good, and better. The stories and characters could fill you with hope, heartbreak, or both every week almost without fail. And best of all - everything about this show was real. Very little, if any, suspension of disbelief was required. Perhaps the best thing I can say about O&A is that it is the only show that I was so passionate about saving, that I sat down and wrote a letter to ABC, asking them to reconsider their canceling of it (as part of an organized campaign with other fans). While the campaign wasn't successful, the release (finally) of the series on DVD will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever, as well as allow those who didn't get to view O&A during its run to discover it, and they too, might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story
1	excellant for all ages but thanks kathy for tackling the menopause! I've worked out with Kathy Smith videos for years. I'm about the same age as her and was delighted when she tackled the subject of the menopause. It is a very postive dvd and it made me feel empowered. I do work out regularly and found the cardio a bit too easy for me but will definately use it on days when I feel a bit tired. I would definately recommend this to beginners and intermediate exercisers of any age. The workouts are short and therefore easy to fit in when busy.
0	A Sleeper (literally) This movie was so bad, I fell asleep watching it in the theatre. I normally like Buddy Films, but this one was just plain bad. The jokes were horrible, the acting was worse. Reality TV fits into this movie seamlessly, which is probably another reason why I didn't enjoy it. I think "Reality" programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business. To sum it all up, save your money, I'm sure you can find a better way to spend it
0	0 STARS: LORD HAVE MERCY!!! "The Church" is nonsensical rubbish. I know Dario Argento is weak on plot, but this movie is absurd. It's interesting how Argento does such a good job with a movie like "Suspiria" creating such an effective atmosphere for a horror movie even though the plot is a bit shaky; but, with "The Church", the creepy atmosphere is clearly not present, and the acting and execution of the screenplay are so bad which only magnifies how terrible the plot is...the result is a disaster!! Indeed, there is zero character development, horrendous acting, monstrous plot holes and an uneven screenplay, all of which lead to this piece of rubbish called "The Church". This movie is trash...PERIOD! STAY AWAY!!!!
1	Love this movie "When Harry Met Sally" is one of my favorite films. It's one of those movies you can watch again and again, and never get sick of it. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are hilarious, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are excellent in their supporting roles. I can't recommend this movie enough.
1	How wonderful to see Womyn of all ages, sizes and colors showing their True Beauty! I really liked this DVD. I already enjoy belly dancing for my husband and this DVD teaches sexy moves that can easily be combined with belly dance moves to seduce your man. Here are some perfect examples of bellydancing and striprteasing combinations. 1. Using wrist circles, which is one of the most basic belly dance moves, to emphasize hip movements when stripping. 2. Facing away from your lover, go from another basic belly dancing move, snake arms, into a striptease move, hugging yourself. 3. While doing a hip drop, a belly dancing move, do a sensual slide, a striptease move. And the 'ol bump and grind is identical to a hip circle! Ah, the fine art of seduction! Not to mention shoulder shinnies, which I still can't seem to do at all well, How frustrating! My only criticism is the end part where the striptease is demonstrated is MUCH to long. Plus, it wasn't neccessary to include the lovemaking scene. A little more instruction on exotic dancing could been substituted, such as lap dancing.
0	The problem with "Alien Quadrilogy" is that only the first two films worth to be seen. 1979 "Alien" by director Ridley Scott and 1986 "Aliens" by director James Cameron, are the only movies of this success Fox franchise, that really were extraordinary films. "Alien" is consider one of the most extraordinary horror movies of all times, mean while "Aliens" is considered one of the best SCI-FI movies of all times. Sadly for the saga, the people of FOX did a very bad job hiring David Fincher to direct "Alien 3" and the French guy Jean-Pierre Jeunet who direct "Aliens resurrection"

1	Navy Heritage - US Navy Seabees This movie has become a part of lore among the men and women of the finest combat contstruction organizations of the US military. It is a nice Hollywood adaptation of the creation of the US Navy Seabees. And who can forget the best character in the movie -- Natasha! It's not often that you see JW's character make the ultimate sacrifice. I watch this and see the beginning of some traditions and attitudes still in practice today. &quot;With Compassion for Others, We Build - We Fight, for Peace with Freedom,&quot; from the Seabee Museum. Remember their montra: Seabee Can-Do
1	Two Sweet-Azz Movies These were my two favorite movies to watch on those all night parties back when I was in school, something good to have on in the background. Dazed & Confused -- The year is 1976. It's the last day of school, and it's time for the new seniors to do some hazing on the new freshmen! Paddling the guys with those wooden boards, and making the girls look like fools. Now that's that done, we spend the rest of the movie drivin around, getting dazed and confused; hanging out at the pool hall; and trying to find a party to go to. Fast Times at Ridgemont High -- The year is 1982. Sex, Drugs, and Rock n' Roll is the story of this movie. Jeff Spicoli is a surfer dude who always being harrassed by his scrict teacher: Mr. Hand. The teacher won't even let Spicoli enjoy a pizza that he ordered in class; no respect for stoners. We've got other characters like Brad Hamilton who's having a hard time finding himself in his senoir year, going from job to job - but he does find a cute girl swimming topless in a pool (played by Pheobe Cates). His sister explores her sexual life. And of course, we have the nerd. Like I said before, two awesome partying movies - like the name of the box set says
1	The Chameleonic Nature Of Reality How do you take a book as psychologically nuanced and sublte as Whitley Streiber's 'Communion' and translate it into a successful film? Judging by the reception it received in theaters across America upon its '89 release and again by the numerous negative reviews here on Amazon.com the answer appears to be you don't. I guess I'll have to disagree with the majority consensus. In my opinion director Philipe Mora has done an admirable job in visualizing Mr. Streiber's disquieting, otherwordly visions, providing us with a disturbing glimpse into the world of UFO's and their occupants. Much of the disappointment and animosity expressed towards this film is due to the ambigious nature of the UFO phenomenon and the directors insistence on leaving it that way. To try and pin down or label psychic experiences is to lose forever the essence of these primal encounters. In such matters we can only ask the questions fully knowing we will never receive the final, definitive answer. Are they from outer space, or someplace much closer to home? It is left for the viewer to decide
0	Back Away From Alice! This movie should have won an Oscar. The acting was superb. Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson were so convincing as lesbians. Their common interest of Jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians, but them (of course), is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes. The writing is amazing. The nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more. Stockard Channing was aspiring as a pyschologist. She made me feel like I could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant. The stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life. The twists and turns provided in The Three Sisters story was like a M Night Shyamalan movie. I won't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise! All in all I feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss. With dialogue like two men saying (...) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like Alice or Claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - I feel like I should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber
0	I Want My MTV! If MTV was smart, and they used to be, along with funny, relevant, and entertaining (they even played music videos all the time!) It was on all day in my house, and you could always count on the VJs passing along some wacky facts, or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently. Anyway, MTV could make their massive video catalog available to the public. You could browse online and choose the videos you wanted, pay $2-$3 each and MTV would either create a custom DVD for you and send it out, or you could download them and make your own DVDs. I would gladly pay to have several DVDs that contained only the videos I wanted. And there are about 100 I want, just off the top of my head. As it is, I am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on VH1 Classic, rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos, 4 of which I may want, the rest I don't. This one did nothing for me. Luckily it was a gift. I never would've bought it for myself
1	PEYTON PLACE (1957) is a movie to treasure I think it is the Americana montages that make the Jerry Wald/Mark Robson production of PEYTON PLACE (1957, Fox) my favorite small-town America soap opera of all time. Grace Metalious' scuzzy and scandalous best-selling novel has been carefully adapted by John Michael Hayes (REAR WINDOW and other 1950's Hitchcock gems). Hampered by censorship that would not allow Selena (Oscar nominee Hope Lange) to have an abortion, it becomes a secret miscarriage and a public appendectomy. Sex scenes become romantic kisses in a vertical position. This is one movie that was actually improved by censorship that forced producer Wald, director Robson, and writer Hayes (all Oscar nominees here) to get more creative. The movie garnered nine Oscar nominations in all, lost all of them in the finals to either THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI or SAYONARA, and was a box office blockbuster that vastly improves on the trashy novel. (CAUTION--PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!) Partially filmed in Camden and other very scenic coastal Maine locations, PEYTON PLACE opens with first-person narration by very likeable heroine Allison Mackenzie (Oscar nominated newcomer Diane Varsi) about the beauty of the seasons in her town. She is then seen having a hasty breakfast with Mom Constance (Best Actress Oscar nominee Lana Turner) before she runs off to high school. Seeming drifter Mike Rossi (Lee Phillips) arrives by car in town and witnesses the son of brutal Lucas Cross (Oscar nominee Arthur Kennedy) and wife Nellie (Betty Field) leave home. Nellie works as the Mackenzie maid. Lucas is the alcoholic school janitor. One of my favorite scenes is a montage of Allison running through backyards and the woods to get to high school, backed by one of Franz Waxman's loveliest scores and William Mellor's beautiful use of CinemaScope. At school, Mildred Dunnock (Miss Thornton) teaches twelfth grade and is expected to be the new Principal. But Mike Rossi becomes the new school Principal. We also meet other school board members, including kindly town doctor Doc Swain (Lloyd Nolan in a career performance) and Harrington (Leon Ames), who runs a textile mill that is the town's biggest industry. In Miss Thornton's classroom, we also meet nice guy male hero Norman Page (Oscar nominee Russ Tamblyn). So in just the first reel, we are introduced to almost all of the major characters. Norman and Allison are an appealing central couple. Radiating out from them are Selena and David Nelson, Constance and Mike Rossi (whose book sex scenes are reduced to forced kisses), and bad girl Betty Anderson (Terry Moore) and Harrington's horny son Rodney (Barry Coe) for more dramatic tension and later misunderstandings. (PLOT SPOILERS-BEWARE!) The rest of a well-paced and engrossing film masterpiece follows these different couples all over town for 157 minutes. Selena gets raped by her stepfather Lucas, resulting in the miscarriage that is publicly called an appendectomy. Allison wants to be a writer. David Nelson wants to be a lawyer. Since the time period here is World War Two, Norman and Rodney both go off to fight overseas. There is a beautiful high school dance to Auld Lang Syne and an exquisite montage of boats on Maine's Penobscot Bay and the glory of Summer after a nostalgic high school graduation. There is also an extended sequence in the film's middle for Labor Day that rivals Labor Day in PICNIC (1955) as the finest ever put on film-singers, school parades, watermelon and hot dogs. When Constance and Mike watch a man put a ship into a bottle, then share a lobster dinner on the bay, backed by Waxman's music, PEYTON PLACE comes very close to being my favorite movie of all time. There is also "Beautiful Dreamer" and rowboats on one river, and two very different couples swimming in a lake outside of Peyton Place, leading to a major misunderstanding. That 20 minute Labor Day sequence is unforgettably evocative, but followed by something gripping and Allison leaving town to become a professional writer. . The climax of PEYTON PLACE, roughly the last half hour of 157 minutes, is a court trial. I won't tell you who is on trial or for what-we have to have some surprises left in this review-but it has Lloyd Nolan's greatest scene as Doc Swain and a satisfying ending. The finale to the movie is one of my all-time favorites (PARTIAL PLOT SPOILER). The final shot is exquisite and euphoric for me, with Allison's voice-over: "We finally discovered that Season of Love. It is only found in someone else's heart. Right now, someone is looking everywhere for it, and it is in you," with two children riding bikes down a shaded Maine street and Waxman's gorgeous score again. (NINE Oscar nominations, but not one for the unforgettably beautiful music score?!) The 1957 Wald/Robson PEYTON PLACE, acted and written to perfection, is a soap opera masterpiece with a very compelling and rewarding plot and some of the most beautiful Americana montages ever put on film. The DVD sells for only $14.95, with audio commentary by surviving cast members Tamblyn and Moore, restored color, lovely remastered music, and glorious CinemaScope letterboxing after decades of cropped pan/scan images. You can finally appreciate William Mellor's use of color and use of wide screen on a movie heavily filmed on both coastal Maine locations (including a lockout mountain scene that is awesome) and the Fox backlot in what is now Los Angeles' Century City. Most of all is a perfect cast down to the bit roles, under Mark Robson's skillful direction. PEYTON PLACE, one of my ten favorite movies ever, is a must-see and must-own on DVD when you have a three hour time slot. Actually longer than 157 minutes because of a 30 minute behind-the-scenes featurette, newsreels, and a theatrical trailer (so you can see how the movie was promoted). (...)
0	THIS is the review I wish I'd read before buying I looked at the name (Groovaloos) and I looked at the cover -- and my gut told me not to get this DVD. I went against my gut and believed the reviews; I wish I'd listened to my gut. For those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey, you're right on the money. They can all dance, but compared to what I expected, they seemed mediocre. Here's the lowdown: (1) the sound sucks - they're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine, but the music isn't loud enough to really "feel" something that makes you want to move, (2) they just seem like a group of people who don't naturally have a rhythm, but they've learned some moves; it's SO not inspiring, (3) it's not edgy enough, and (4) it looks good if you've got a group doing it, but when someone's doing it alone, it's just okay. Overall, this DVD was okay, but not great. Get it only if you're truly desperate

0	Weak content dooms Guitar Demon I consider Buckethead a unique artist with an original vision. The manifestation of that vision on his 13th Anniversary DVD, while intriguing and amusing, is for only his most devoted, hard-core fans. I've liked some of his stuff on YouTube, and saw the DVD by chance passing through a cd/dvd store in a mall and took a chance. Bad decision. I can go along with the "Cheapo Depot" look and vibe, but when it comes down to delivering content, this is a bloated, nearly unwatchable video. The content is presented in two disks, but it should have been one. The live concert material on disk 2 looks as if shot on consumer grade video cameras, featuring Bucket playing along to pre-recorded tracks, doing the robot, and a display of his num-chucks skills. The music, speed-rock with doses of country chicken pickin and classical flavors, sounds largely the same from song to song. Frankly, I was bored. The is an experiment gone wrong. His over-the-top Dr. Phibes meets Yngvie meets the dark side of Disney is realized as an unfocused mess on this package. The result it had on me is that I am unlikely to buy another DVD or song from him without checking into reviews first, so buyer beware. Memo to Buckethead: find someone to focus your vision and move on to the next phase of your career
1	What any TRUE Buckethead fan would expect/want... Simply put, I bought this, brought it home, and spent the wee hours of the night smiling on the couch as the one and only Buckethead filled my living room with his unique brand of guitar-shred-funk-fusion-dementia. This dvd is a trip, from the wacked out menus to the oodles of content that cover his whole career so far...videos (Praxis!), discography (you think you have it all, but I assure you, you don't), and a bonus dvd with 2 live shows (it doesn't hurt that I can see myself in the Boston one, laughing like a goon as he hands out toys). There's just tons of bucketgoodies hiding in here. This dude is just the whole package-Eddie Van Halen and Eddie Hazel all in one, mixed with Leatherface and The Shape. So rad. This dvd definitely had a lot of time and creativity put into it, so to anyone who doesn't enjoy this for the perfect representation of the Bucketman that it is, you simply be missin' the point. Might I suggest you stick to your Dream Theater/Satriani/G3 dvd's, you 5.1 Surround sound obsessed prog-metal nerds...you don't like chickens, get out the coop
0	Sorry This movie is so freakin stupid. Yes its funny...but so very dumb. Not good dumb; bad dumb. Terribly, painfully stupid. Funny at times. Best avoided or taken in small doses
1	Funny Saw this movie on cable and it was so funny to my fiance' and I that I went to Amazon and bought it. I do not think you will be disappointed if you buy it
0	My advice, watch 'Get Shorty' instead The problem with this film is I read the book. I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent. The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example. Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!" But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit. "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made. A few laughs are provided. A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature. Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved. Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½. The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot. Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room. Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug. I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director. Enough said there. My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.'
1	loved the workout years ago, loe the DVD Leisa Hart is by far the best STEEL instructor, i have always loved her style and consider her my own personal trainer when using her videos. she is charming and genuine, a real woman. i love her new videos like Gym In A Box and the Core Series and can't wait for her Sexy Series. She is a great teacher and can help anyone, even witha ten yr old video
1	War Movie classic Great movie for WWII buffs. One of the best submarine movies in my opinion. However, people who are not hard core war movie viewers will likley find it too slow and boring. They did a great job getting it on DVD
0	Such a bad movie they made a second! The first movie was full of hammy and snobbish acting. Perhaps it was the point of the first movie to just be rude and awkward because the plot of this movie is that a boy bets his step sister that he can sleep with the new girl on campus. This is not an original plotline, but the added twist is that if the boy sleeps with this new girl, as part of the bet the step sister will give herself to her step-brother. Take that for what its worth. There was a good crop of rookie actors in the first movie, but then the second movie is not worth it at all. It was a B movie... which is why it went straight to video. If your a frustrated teen boy, you will love this movie for its sexual content. Otherwise, it is greatly overacted and over dramatic
1	The Duke takes the burden of aerial command in WWII John Wayne stars in this thoroughly entertaining film about Marine WWII pilots. The Duke takes command and drives his men hard to accomplish the mission of close air support - a very dangerous endeavor. While his XO does not agree with his methods, he does come to appreciate them later on. Flying Leathernecks includes some excellent real combat footage from WWII, which adds a nice touch of authenticity. The characters and dialogue will engage the viewer, and really help keep the plot moving along. If you like the movie Flying Tigers, or other WWII aviation films then you will enjoy this one. Or, if you simply like the Duke in military films, then this one is also worth viewing.
0	Horrendous Clive Barker did a good job on the original Candyman. It was truly a cut above most horror movies. The second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous. There is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable. Donna D'Errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks. Lets hope this is the last sequel
1	Its a good action movie I was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story. It found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie. Having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows. Still it is worth looking at.
1	As good as the real thing When I heard that Incubus was going to put out a live DVD from their 2004 Summer Tour I was estatic. This is one of the few music DVDs that captures the entire concert to a tee. How do I know? I saw Incubus at the Lawlor Event Center in Reno on this tour. It was amazing, and so is the DVD. Buy it
1	In-credible, make yourself by this.... ...the fact that out of 19 reviews 17 are 5star says alot about this DVD. Im not going to go off on one about this as i dont have time to (i know i'd get carried away as theres so much to comment on this) but basically i thought the Morning View Sessions were a good demonstration of Incubus live, Volume 2 is great, especially the live Cali-accoustic tracks (awesome) but this concert is unbelievable, so so good! Highlights for me are for a start seeing alot of the Crow Left of the Murder tracks live as the album is brilliant & has grown on me so much over time, but also just seeing how well Incubus can improvise & adapt their songs to sound even better live. Theres a great version of "Drive" here, but the lengthened versions of "Sick, Sad Lille world" & "A certain shade of Green" are amazing. The guitar work on "S,S L W", "Priceless" & "Pistola" is brilliant. Other greatly performed trackes include "Wish you were here" (such an anthem nowadays), "Here in my room", "Made for TV movie" (a new favourite of mine) & "Talk shows on mute". also very cool to see "Pantomine" live, its also on the bonus CD, along with a couple live tracks & a couple of non-album tracks. im hoping to get to the Leeds festival this summer (if i can blag a ticket somehow) so very much looking forward to seeing them even if it is only for an hour! Theyre the best band in the world in my opinion. Basically buy this if you love incubus, its the best DVD you can get of them...
0	The world's full of lonely people Patrick Dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy, as did the characters he played. He was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in, somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance, but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end. Here was no acception. He plays the lovable loser once again, this time he was an arrogant, cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college. Disappointed and angry at his failing grades, his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place. While Patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor, he encounters a beautiful, mysterious stranger who (like the plot to a bad porn movie) makes his job worth while with no strings attached. While this fleeting encounter might have ended there, the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this, and soon Patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy. The smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that. Long before Desperate Housewives he was their Afternoon Delight. What was amazing to me in watching this movie is that Patrick didn't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires. He is simply a friend, a companion, someone to talk with. I guess I just don't understand why some of the women he was servicing didn't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head. Of course, as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did, it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving. That's an urban ledgend if there ever was one. I gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words. Still, it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people
0	Should have been PG 13 I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one.
0	A film that you already seen before "Killing Me Softly" has one of those scripts that just don't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big "twist" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven't seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he's an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she's not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly In spite of all that, Chen Kaige's direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous "** out of 5" rating. But if you're a Heather Graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes; and for Joseph Fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks.
1	How can you be brainwashed by your own mother? A rather melodramatic rewriting of a plot that could have been produced by Tennessee Williams. The black widow of a mother who only lives and marries to get a son and put her hands on a big agricultural - or so - estate will not hesitate to kill and then she brainwashes her own son into believing his father died in some kind of an accident. What happens when this son gets married and is expecting a child from his newly wed wife ? The attachment of the son to his mother is shown as perverse and leading to the rejection of the wife, of the mother of the baby to come. Then it melodramatically develops into a new criminal affair and the son finds then the courage, in the name of his wife and child, to break off and go. There is something incestuous and insane in this mother and the film sounds sad and unhappy, in spite of the positive ending. A son, a man, a human being in general cannot live as a human being if he or she rejects his or her parents utterly. This is hatred and hatred is nothing but the perversion of love and hatred makes love impossible. A man or woman who hates cannot love anyone properly and rejects herself or himself out of society. Hatred is psychotic and leads, sooner or later, to murder and death. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
1	"Rockin' from the Delta to the DMZ!" Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon. Mitch Markowitz's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other. Director Barry Levinson successfully harnessed the comedian's wild, manic energy in this movie. Of course, the Williams' radio monologues (famously adlibbed by the comedian) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour ("What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery."). Williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in. His best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision (Peter Weir, Terry Gilliam and Gus Van Sant) and this one is no different. Even though Good Morning is essentially a vehicle for Williams, Levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors, like Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh. Along with Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth, Good Morning Vietnam gives a human dimension to the Vietnamese people. Unlike many other Vietnam War movies of the `80s, the Vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities. This incarnation is an improvement over the previous DVD. There is a six part "Production Diary" that runs 34 minutes. This is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed. He sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on (and the film's title). Director Barry Levinson talks about Robin Williams' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script. One part also focuses on the film's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n' roll music and the role it played in the movie. Another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in Thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there. Add to that the extremely hot weather which, incidentally, gave the film a certain amount of authenticity. There are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly, only cast members Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl are back with Williams no where to be found. "Raw Monologues" features 13 minutes of footage from Williams' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes. There is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form, watching how Williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations. Finally, there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers
0	Just plain boring, and totally overhyped. CONTAINS SPOILERS!! In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable "Don't Look Now". Six years later, Cronenberg - obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture - decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme, with disasterously boring results. To synopsise the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids. So it's David Cronenberg. So what? Performances and direction, as well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic American horror movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en', but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown. Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist', nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a lot. It's not good. In short, where a movie matters most, 'The Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema. A note on the subtext: It's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could care less about subtext? I couldn't.
0	Worst Movie I've Ever Seen (exept "I Am The Cheeze") I was in the Army when this came out, working on helicopters. I saw the movie at Travis AFB in California....well, as much as I saw. I DID walk out of the theatre. Even yelling quips at all of the cheezy lines (and there are plenty) wasn't entertainment enough to keep me from screaming at my shoes. I left fuming and spent the next hour waiting in a cold M1008 for the rest of my buddies to get done watching it. I'm sickened watching Nicholas Cage to this very day
0	a poorly edited documentary; story misses the mark I agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there aren't more dissenting opinions. This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.) The filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it. Don't bother with this one.
0	whiney, alcoholic, aging hippie makes ass of himself in another culture I hate to be the only one to say it. but this movie sucked. It's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to Tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational. This movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful. The main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass. He manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in Tuva, and in one instance hands an unsuspecting Tuvan a joint. Not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well. But its hard to take since Paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed. But paul isnt the only ass of this documentary. He also has help from his Friends of Tuva and the filmers. if there is any value in watchings this piece of @#*# its in what not to do when you visit other countries. Seriously, one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there. From that character's earlier appearences in the film, i would have to say that he would have deserved it. The only thing going for this movie is photage of acual Tuvan's singing. Im so sorry they had to meet this guy. If you do decide to get this don't forget to watch the interview with the directors. Thats definately the best part. Ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before, but this two are like charactures of them. if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing The Journey Of Man
1	Shoulda Been A Star Good action movie. I actually saw this in the theater(yes, it did have a theatrical release!) back in the day. This was about the time when cheap action and horror films were starting to disappear from theaters. Excessive Force would be straight to video if released today. Pity, coz it's pretty fun. Thomas Ian Griffth never became the next Seagal or VanDamme-something the producers were obviously trying to do with him-but he really does the action tough guy thing wonderfully. He even had a hand in the script. He's got the look and the moves, he's even a decent actor. He went on to do some direct to video action pics, and played the lead vampire in John Carpenter's Vampires. You may also remember him as one of the villians from Karate Kid III(the guy who teaches Daniel how to break noses). Other than that, the guy is virtually unknown. The plot doesn't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of cops/robbers action, but it's a cliched film done well. It's got a better than average supporting cast of James Earl Jones, Lance Henriksen, Tony Todd(the Candyman himself!), and Burt Young(Paulie from the Rocky movies). These guys must have also seen potential of the script to want to appear in it. Good supporting actors, a good script, and a good performance from the lead raise this otherwise by-the-numbers action movie up a few notches to something quite entertaining
0	Where is Deadtime Stories??!!! I bought this set just for that movie and IT'S NOT ON HERE!! Why?! I am so mad
0	Not good... Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised. Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan. However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch. While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful. As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else. But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..
0	its ok but I gave it away Although I love the Firm, this one is not my favorite.It is a good workout,there is just something about it...it drags.Perhaps Ms DelRio is not quite as toned as one would hope..I don't know.At one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.I have dozens of Firms and some with this instructor, that I like.It seems that most Firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it, but this one falls short in some indescribable way
0	Failure It's well known that 'Showgirls' flopped. I remember director Paul Verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year'. It's not hard to point out its failure: the young & attractive lead Elizabeth Berkley cannot act. As Elizabeth is in focus quite a lot, her frequent appearance turns 'Showgirls' into disaster. In hindsight it's incredible that an experienced director like Paul Verhoeven hired someone like her. I guess the blatant display of nudity in Berkley's role, as well as in this whole movie, made better actresses look elsewhere. The more so, while 'Showgirls' theme and plot are somewhat meagre. One star for the effort, and another for the nice picturing. Any lavish display of female nudity cannot cover the failure of 'Showgirls' concept
1	THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE SERIES! I just figured I'd get that out of the way. This is not the entire series as it seems most people are assuming. This is the Complete Collection Part 1. I'm really not sure why it was done this way, but it is so I just want to make sure to avoid any confusion since there seems to be quite a bit. Wolf's Rain is my single favorite anime to this day and I still watch it as much as anything else in my collection. It is the story of Keba, Hige, Toboe, and Tsume. They are wolves, a creature thought to have been hunted to extinction by humans 200 years ago. There is a legend that when mankind comes to an end, a paradise will decend upon the Earth that only wolves will be able to attain. This is the background for the show as Keba and the others meet and begin a long journey to find paradise. There are a lot of side stories thrown in to keep the viewer on edge including the wolf hunter tracking our heroes, two human scientists who eventually become caught up in the legend of wolves, and an evil empire that wants to open up paradise for their own evil intentions. Eventually everything intertwines and creates the setting for one of the most powerful endings to any show I have ever seen. But in order to see the entire thing, you will either have to wait until the second half of this collection is released or buy the actual box set that does contain the entire series. Either way you choose to do it, you can't go wrong with Wolf's Rain
1	Movie review If you're an old movie buff, as I am, I think you will like this one. I have seen it on TV but it is one for the collection. I have watched it twice already since I got it
1	Fantastic animated rendition It's hard to believe, but I never heard of Wind in the Willows until I was about 16 years old, when it was first read aloud to me, around a glowing campfire. It was an instant love affair. Years later, I shared the classic with my children. So when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor's tag sale, we snapped it up. We've loved the film ever since. The animal characters--Badger, Mole, Toad, Weasel and all the others--congregate often at Toad Hall and elsewhere, and the story takes many delightful turns. This animated version, directed by Dave Unwin, is every bit as classic as the book. Your children will surely love it as much as we did--including the child in this particular mom. --Alyssa A. Lappe
1	A Wonderful Experience Revisited Even though this was one of Prince's underrated movies, I still love it. The DVD version includes all of the music videos (some in color) that were released in reference to the soundtrack. This was ingenious for the marketability of this DVD. Way to go
0	Oy Vey. Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination. Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead? I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers. But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal. And the film design! Bleh! Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake. The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated. I felt so much dumber after watching this movie. I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book. Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites. I don't know why I thought of that book just now. I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much
1	Challenging and Timeless If you loathe exercise videos in which the instructor is telling you "good job - keep it up - way to go - that looks good" when you know they can't see you, this is an excellent alternative. Cindy is clear in her instructions, of course her body is inspirational, and she doesn't insult your intelligence. The video itself is shot in some beautiful locations and the music isn't overbearing. The actual exercise sequences are challenging and continue to be so - even if you use this tape several times a week for a few months like I did. The best thing about this video is the results - I used this video several years ago and got down to a healthy size 4/6. I just ordered the DVD version to get me back into shape after having my first baby and can't wait to start this routine again!
0	my first movie review This is the first movie review I have ever written. I wish I could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic...like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire. Wait, it gets worse...I actually bought this piece of camel dung.. .. I am going to loan it to a prick at work that I hate! No, I'll give it to him and refuse to take it back... Hurry, go see it!
1	The Book of Acts made interesting and understandable! First, I agree with other reviewers here that the portrayal of Paul the Apostle by Anthony Hopkins is a standout performance worthy of an emmy nomination. Robert Foxworth's Peter is also interestingly done but our information is lacking about his ministry when he disappears after Chapter 7 in the book of Acts. Therefore the movie focuses on Paul's attempt to unite Jew,Greek and Roman in a trinity of new Christian faith and this film delivers on that concept, even though it is somewhat romanticized. Some very effective scenes remind you of "Jesus of Nazareth". One suprise is when Paul is being confronted by his "thorn in the flesh" while consulting with Barnabas and Mark, you hear a mysterious sound that is tough to catch but Mark inquires what it is to which Paul replies "just an animal". (Actually it is a devil). Also there is a great confrontation with the woman who throws her voice into statues and animals to ridicule Paul's ministry. When Paul tells her that she won't have the power to do that again it is effective enough to put a fear of the Lord into you! We get to see the journeys of Paul and Barnabas (you will notice a gradual decline in the richness of Barnabas shown in his clothing) , we meet Luke, Timothy, Silas, Mark and get a basic grip on what the spread of Christianity was all about in the ancient world. Nero's fay behavior will get on your nerves especially when he is engaged in conversations about Paul with his jailer. Paul's triumphant entry as a prisoner into Rome will remind you of Jesus and his entry into Jerusalem so much so that it can bring a tear to your eye. The original scene of Paul forgiving the Axeman when he is beheaded has been removed for some reason on this DVD. Well recommended to anyone who wants some insight into the early development of the Church and to understand persecution of the apostles!
0	Yuck I love and "get" John Waters ("Cry Baby", "Hairspray", "Serial Mom" etc)and I love the unique slightly larger than life elevated acting style he demands from his actors. But THIS one left me cold, uncomFARTable and slightly nauseous. I didnt even finish watching it. I decided to rather take a dip in our local sewerage
1	Sci Fi that never goes out of style Before buying any Dr Who series you should be aware that the special effects for the most part suck. However, the general plot is great and the plot lines are exceptional. This was a must have from my childhood, expecially since it was a Tom Baker (the long scarfed Doctor) series. I enjoyed thoroughly because it brought to light the creation of one of the Doctors most deadly enemies (the Daleks). It also contains a few characteristic one liners by Tom Baker.
1	Simpler Times Tales of Avonlea is a great film to be enjoyed by children and adults. It takes you back to a more simpler, and innocent time. It will make you laugh and sometimes it will bring tears to your eyes.You will enjoy the adventures that Alex,Felicity, and Sarah take you on. This film was beautifully made! So, sit back and enjoy Tales of Avonlea and beautiful Prince Edward's Island
1	Worth watching braced myself when I rented this because I thought it was not going to be very funny - and I was pleasantly surprised. Some parts of it were hilarious - Michael Richards (Kramer from Seinfeld) has a medium sized role and is as funny as ever. I was not dissapointed. It's not sophisticated humor, but well worth it for the laughs. Very enjoyable
0	Only one reason to watch this film... ...and it's staring at you on the video cover. It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene. No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense. It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy. Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it. But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her
0	Blade Trilogy Ending Deserves Better Than This !! This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort.
1	Intriguing and creepy, but Rickman fans will love it anyway The acting is fine, but the story--help! The problem is not Rickman's or Grant's unsavory characters, but the propensity in too many small, independent British films to present lower-middle class characters as if they were slow. The message I get from all these films comes across as snobbish: That people are poor in Britain because they are stupid. But stupidity by itself isn't funny anyway, although that point is lost on producers from both sides of the Ocean. Here, Cate plays a girl who is more than young and naive as the adverts suggest; she is a mentally handicapped and/or emotionally disturbed girl. (The girl's aunt and uncle are also unpleasantly slow.) Cate plays this very well, but her character becomes creepy and rather repulsive. On the other hand, Rickman's and Grant's reaction to her character is what gives this film its interest. Rickman seducing Cate's underage character (she doesn't really look it) isn't creepy at all and is the high point of the film, but maybe that's because it's Rickman that does it. Grant is excellent, playing a different role than usual, and he looks different and slightly goofy here too, a bit like Terry Thomas. But Rickman fans will not want to miss this movie
1	Good Film -- even the guys should like this "chick flick!" Entertaining and fun relationship flick with the outstanding team of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. These two always work great together
1	Finally- a Documentary about White Collar Crime This is an excellent portrayal of the Enron fiasco. It utilizes footage and sound bites, and interviews, it's absolutely amazing what happened! This film is a must see for everyone
1	Loved it over and over again Love this DVD! Can't say enough about it. You will love it to, young or old. Very good technique and fun too
1	A beautifully subtle and genuinely emotional film This is clearly one of the most polarising of Jane Austen adaptations on film. Some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting, the authentically costumed characters, the beautiful scenery and sets, the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film. Others will loathe the complete absence of makeup, the fact that Amanda Root is visibly older than 29, the slow and tender story, the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the Mr Elliot sub-plot (including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards Mrs Smith). I acknowledge both of these views. Certainly Amanda Root does not enhance her natural sweet looks, and she does look a little too old for the part of Anne Elliot, but mon dieu, her acting! That is something else again. In terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character, no better actress could have been found. If only she'd been permitted to "youthify" her looks a little... After all, in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it's true her looks had faded somewhat, her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest, I do prefer superb acting to superb looks, and that is why I find Amanda Root's portrayal so very moving and real. Ciarï¿½n Hinds is excellent as Captain Wentworth, Anne's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago. He is not movie-star handsome, but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes. In personality and character, he is undeniably the right match for Ms Root's Anne. The interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach. He is very deliberately ignoring Anne, although with perfect politeness. More and more, the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them, and the beauty of Anne's character is so wonderfully brought out by Amanda Root's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised. The sub-plots are also superbly explicated. Anne's selfish and heedless father (Corin Redgrave) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister Elizabeth(Phoebe Nicholls), not to mention her laughably tiresome sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on Anne's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour. Mr Elliot (the brilliant Samuel West) doesn't really get enough storytime in this adaption, unfortunately - I do think the script didn't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character. But the wonderful Fiona Shaw is perfect in the role of Mrs Croft (Anne's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times), and Lady Russell (Anne's mentor) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by Susan Fleetwood. I also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking Mrs Clay (Felicity Dean) and the thoroughly nice Charles Musgrove who, having been rejected by Anne, decided to wed Mary instead (very, very well played by Simon Russell Beale, who makes this sort of role look completely effortless). The look of this film is lovely in many ways. The lack of makeup may take some getting used to, but there's no denying it's authentic, and with such excellent acting from everyone involved, the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed. The truly magnificent singing of opera singer Rosa Mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any Jane Austen film. (All too often, the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice', but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class. Or... if no natural talent was possessed, perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing. But music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces.) To sum up: for those who want a film that is purely escapist, that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is "exciting" to watch, this is probably not a film that will appeal to you. For those, however, who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances, there will be great enjoyment for you
0	Made-for-TV Rubbish Combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial (lots of guitars and vibraphones, let's call it "Rock On with NAWSA"), this film tells the viewer much more about Hollywood femnists' perceptions of the past, than it does about the past itself. All decked out in Edwardian costumes, the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips, all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the Progressive Era. These scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman, for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement, yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points, she too will take up the banner and join the NAWSA crusade. Perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when Alice told a Washington Post reporter: "I'm having dinner with Helen Keller." The reporter, "Don't stare, she hates that." Yet, I suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music: rock is not only inapposite to the 1910s, it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns. Indeed, one of the few songs the producers chose from the early 20th century was "Ain't She Sweet"-- a Roarin' Twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by Paul Ash & His Orchestra at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker. Alice Paul was hardly a flapper, nor was she an astute poitical strategist. She was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater, much more productive efforts of Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston) and others who had continued the struggle since Seneca Falls in 1848. Catt used Paul's antics to good effect in eventually persuading President Wilson (here, woefully overweight) to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the Great War. Paul was at most a footnote in the process. I showed this film to my Gilded Age-Progressive Era class last spring; consider a few written comments from today's undergraduates: "disjointed" -- "historically inept and emotion-ridden" -- "this was Hilary Swank in INSOMNIA Part 2" -- "numerous historical inaccuracies included women's hair and men's clothing styles from later eras, the misuse of props like a small woman's wrist watch and a Crown Graphic press camera, both of which did not exist in 1918, plus the American flag behind Wilson is hung backwards" -- "the parts where she (Paul/Swank) was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by Speiberg, but his was more convincing" & my favorite: "why not really screw it up and throw in a little Helen Reddy at the end?
0	What? I can't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got. The acting is laughable as is the writing. There are also many mistakes and inaccuracies! They depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys. Real life isn't like that. I guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up. But this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
0	Disappointing......... very disappointing The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times. So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant. What a disappointment! The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy. There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as "Do you believe in Ghosts?" The "lighter" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling. Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D. Yet "The Polar Express" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.
1	It's quite surprising how much it holds up Before South Park came on the air and offended practically everybody with cripple fights to cooking parents in chili to saying the S word a record 162 times, there was Beavis and Butthead. Found on MTV, the pair were crude and just plain moronic who laughed at even the mention of dirty words bringing out the popular catchphrase "uh-huh, you said ". After the show ended, the pair got their own movie and became a surprise hit so who would've guessed that it's actually still funny? Beavis and Butthead are sleeping on their trademark couch which allows a pair of robbers to steal their prized TV. Not wanting to just allow it, they go hunting for it and end up meeting Muddy, a biker who will pay them to "do" his wife, which of course he means kill but they didn't get that part. So he flies them to Vegas to meet her only she sends them to Washington with something particularly interesting and quite dangerous. And of course the hilarity and antics ensue. Now, the humor seems kind of tame. Buzzards having sex with each other or a topless sphinx probably doesn't have that kneeslapper kick to it like it used to. Not that I mind anyway since even if certain jokes don't work, the whole thing has a very loose and laid-back feeling about it where it doesn't even matter if you're not laughing, you're just glad they're up there. Some jokes, such as the preposition one, Beavis' alter-ego Cornholio are always funny, not to mention Robert Stack's ATF character's love for cavity searches. Does it have some problems? A bit. The reliance on toilet humor can only go so far and you kind of wanted them to do more America rather than the limited ones we have here. We literally skip over certain states that could've got some good mileage. And while visually impressive, the Rob Zombie inspired freak-out in the desert just doesn't fit (and to be honest: anything involving Rob Zombie and filmmaking just doesn't work). But they're only minor concerns and of course this is a MTV movie - a Beavis and Butthead one nonetheless - so all that stuff gets thrown out the window. The special features are pretty good but you kind of wish there was more. We have a commentary with Mike Judge and Yvette Kaplan with Mike slipping into character a couple times(not often enough but the mention of his dream involving the movie is hilarious). The featurette is slightly disappointing as while we do get some background and discussion, some of it is either redundant and back-patting or mentioned already in the commentary. But seeing some footage of the VA's, including Mike Judge doing Beavis, Butthead and Mr. Anderson are always awesome. If you were into the show, this is of course a good place to start. If you weren't, give it a try since this is probably the best launch pad to get into the show
0	Big Disappointment I was excited about this DVD because of the customized workout feature, but I couldn't even make it through a preview. The instructor's voice is grating. She sounds similar to Denise Austin so if you, like me, are sensitive to voice tone: be warned. And then there's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which, to my mind, is entirely wrong for a yoga routine. If you're looking for a yoga DVD with a customized workout feature, I'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed "Yoga Shakti" by Shiva Rea
0	waste of talent, time, and money I had the unfortunate experience of spending money at Blockbuster and renting this dud. With such big name stars, I expected at least a mildly entertaining movie. What I got was one hour of lifeless, drab, big-budget flick. I couldn't bear to watch another minute, thus "Tequila Sunrise" became the first rental I stopped watching since that fateful day I rented "Last Action Hero". The actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes, lending not one iota of believability to their characters. I'm sure Michelle Pfeiffer, Mel Gibson, and Kurt Russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers. I hope the actors had fun making this production; I sure as heck didn't have any fun watching it
1	Rescue Me seasons 1 & 2 I love watching the episodes without commercials. This show is the best!
1	Watanabe's New Masterpiece Samurai Champloo has become one of the greatest anime series ever with this final volume. It ranks well beside Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe's other masterpiece of anime, and in many ways surpasses it. Watanabe's series, though based in fuedal Japan, does not limit itself to those restrictions, instead taking a surrealistic view of history, which allows for both minor and huge discrepancies, and the larger the lie, the funnier the episode. Along with the comedy, the story centers around great action and even greater music. But in this volume, drama dominates. All of the characters meet the conclusion of their own personal stories, while wrapping up their story as a group. Jin faces a man directly linked to his past as a swordsman; Mugen faces a family bent on revenge for Mugen's past life as a pirate; and Fuu finally meets the Sunflower Samurai. Though you may think I spoiled it, just watch and see, for none of these endings end exactly as you would expect. Then, after all three of these linked episodes are finished, you are treated to a Reggae-style rap sung partly in English but mostly in Japanese. To me, this was the perfect ending theme to a series that relied heavily on its music. So as not to spoil, I'll finish my review saying this. The end of Samurai Champloo is both exciting and a bit sad. It's a perfect conclusion to a perfect anime series, and sufficiently answers all the questions left behind in the previous volumes. If you have any anime sense, then you've already seen this anime and love it. If you don't, then hurry and get this so that you can say you were one of the first to see one of the best. This anime was definitely worth me collecting every separate volume, and I'd recommend the same for anyone else out there. Right now, I'm hoping Watanabe takes the same direction he did with Cowboy Bebop and makes the Samurai Champloo movie
0	Film student work My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the "philosophy" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places. All in all, I found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if only the script had gone to someone else to make. On a side note, Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser, which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went
1	Wallace & Gromit RULE! You can't lose with Wallace and Gromit. Great for the entire famil
1	Great for 12-14 year olds This is a very good, contemporary visual text of a resistant fairy-tale. It is a valuable teaching resource for the teaching of writing of this particular type of text. Plus the kids love it and it's a bit of fun!
1	Uncut Escaflowne is better than the Fox version The uncut Escaflowne still isn't quite as good as the original with subtitles, but it much better than Fox's version. Thing make more sense now because Fox was cutting out important scenes. This series is a must have and this tape is definitely good and with every tape I get the series seems to get better and better
0	A silly juvenile film. A pseudointellectual piece of nonsense. Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people. But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day. The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism). The film appeals to naive youth
0	Do all films with "Demon" in the title stink? I am a huge Argento fan, but come on folks...this movie just stinks. There's more corn in this flick than the State of Kansas. The single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something. There are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which Argento's uncanny editing and camera work shine. Otherwise its a feast for the idiots; green blood, bad make-up and all. Definately not one to purchase for the collection
0	A GREAT FILM RUINED HELLO????? Whoever mastered this great film RUINED it by FORGETTING or REFUSING to provide English subtitles for the Japanese and Italian characters. How can such a thing happen? If you find the VHS buy it. Maybe some day someone will make the corrections. Until then, AVOID this DVD
0	Worset movie ever I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset. The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible. The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!
0	...you had me at goodbye... ...this movie is at the top of my list...unfortunately, it's the 'worst movie of all-time' list...that's right, ladies and gentlemen, friends and supporters of this film...this movie is trash (and not just for cuba's horribly annoying acting)...it's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable...come on...do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction...it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands...and if all you base a relationship on, is the end justifying the means, well, i wish you luck with your next soul mate..
0	Mediocre, at best! I have read "Into Thin Air" and watched the Discovery Channel series on Mt. Everest, so I received this DVD with great anticipation. However, my excitement dissolved quickly due to the cheesy music, awful special effects, lack of drama, and poor landscape visuals. I was completely bored. It was a waste of 45 minutes
1	Magnificent transfer by Criterion I am not going to write about the merits of Ran, i.e., it is a given that it is perhaps Kurosawa's finest work. If you bought the previous Masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the Criterion, don't hesitate. The "Masterworks" transfer is a travesty compared to the Criterion. The colors just bleed in the Masterworks, whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant. On the Masterworks DVD there is a restoration demo, which I thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the Criterion. Get this DVD if you are a Kurosawa fan; you won't regret it. This is perhaps the finest Criterion DVD that I have purcased, and I own over 40 Criterions
1	The coming home from war movie. I love this movie, it is a must see for anyone who is in the military or is a military family member. It is emotionally charged with issues every military family deals with when the soldier returns from war. Keep a box of tissues handy, I cry everytime I watch it. Eventhough it takes place post WWII, the feelings remain the same for every generation.
1	Superb value package If Bette Davis is not remembered as the best actress to come out of Hollywood in the Golden Era, she certainly was thought so at the time and this package easily demonstrates the range of her talent. This set, compared to Volume One, which contains obvious Davis hits, covers a wider period of her career from 1937 to 1962. Two favourite Davis films, "The Man Who Came to Dinner" and "Marked Woman" are included. More detailed reviews of each of these films can be viewed under their individual titles so by way of a quick summary: - "Marked Woman" is a sensational 1937 film about prostitutes who go to court to get their gangster pimp incriminated. This was the first film Davis made after she walked out of Warner Brothers and was sued for breach of contract. She lost and returned to the studio but with a new found respect. She gives an intense performance and the film is very exciting with a great downbeat ending. - "Jezebel" is the 1938 film for which Davis won her second Oscar, a precursor to "Gone with the Wind" and directed superbly by William Wyler. The film is a soap opera about a willful Southern girl and would fall into trivia without Davis's subtle performance and Wyler's attention to detail. - "Dark Victory" from 1939 was possibly Davis's favourite role about a Long Island socialite with a brain tumour. The film is a tour de force for Davis who might have won another Oscar if the film had been released in a different year. - "The Man Who Came to Dinner" is an ensemble piece, an excellent version of the 1941 Kaufman and Hart Broadway Hit. Davis supports Monty Woolley, a character based on Alexander Woolcott, who hilariously dominates the film. - "Old Acquaintance" from 1943 maybe the quintessential woman's picture with Davis starring with rival Miriam Hopkins. It is a picture which resonated with "woman's issues" in 1943 and was remade in the 80's as "Rich and Famous". - "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is the famous teaming with Joan Crawford in a baroque tragedy which has become a cult (and camp) classic. The film was shot on a small budget and in 3 weeks and it shows. The extras alone make up hours of additional viewing which enhance the films immeasurably, although some of the commentaries are poor with far too much gossip about Davis's overanalysed relationship with Joan Crawford. Best of all, the excellent documentary "Stardust: The Bette Davis Story" has been included. The Collection is great value
1	Rattle, Hum & Chill Out I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now. Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie. Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the "holy lands" of rock. If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it. Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland. Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written. By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career. Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage. Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride. It's only rock'n'roll
1	Not the best season but still gets the job done Scrubs continues it's trek onward from it's humble beginnings in the third season. The first season revolved around everything from JD coping with being a doctor, to Turk and Carla beginning their relationship, to JD and Elliot's crazy relationship. Season two continued from there and even expanding upon it. JD and Elliot hooked up again. Turk and Carla became even more close. Dr. Cox even gets thrown in the mix a lot more with the storyline of him getting back with Jordan. That brings us to season three. Following up on two tremendous season isn't easy and they, in my opinion, succumb to the pressure somewhat. Of the three seasons released on DVD so far, this season is my least favorite. Never fear though. Season three still has plenty of laughs, plenty of guest appearances (Michael J. Fox will probably go down as my favorite), and you get to know the entire cast even more. All these things make for a memorable season, but in some cases they seem to have backed themselves into a corner. There's more than a fair share of laughs along the way, be it the janitor becoming a security guard, Cox dealing with his child, Turk and Carla basically becoming one person (funnier than it sounds), Elliot's rekindling flame of season one's Sean, and JD's continued troubles of being a doctor/lover. Everything is funny, just a notch below seasons one and two. Overall, yes, this could've been better (episode wise, extras are amazing as always), but I'm still happy with what we've been given. The cliffhanger is a good one and I look forward to seeing even more scenarios continued in season four's DVD release
0	Old Action Heroes don't die, they just fade away. Instructions: rent Steven Seagall's latest action movie knuckle-fest "Exit Wounds". Insert in DVD player; watch first 15 minutes of movie, remove from DVD player. Return to video store. If you follow those instructions to the letter, you'll have fun with "Exit Wounds", which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory (Seagall attempts to thwart a brash, brazen assassination attempt). There's also a great scene---strike that, a Priceless Scene: hipster uber-villain (played convincingly by rapper DMX) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot (ultimately settling on a Lamborghini Murcielago, paid for in cash out of a golf bag). The scene is dope, def, and cool---it's all GOOD, Dawgz!----,in a New Jack City way. And that's a shame, really: it's so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin, over the course of two hours, to realize that the rest of the movie just can't hold a candle to its opening minutes. An action movie should be exciting; after Seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the U.S. Vice President (a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own, and from which 95% of the trailer material was taken), "Exit Wounds" is not exciting. It's stale. It's rehashed. Honestly, were it not for DMX, the few riffs from the movie's excellent rap soundtrack, and the equipment, I would have thought I was watching an eighties Seagall flick. And that's surprising, given that the movie is helmed by "Romeo Must Die" director Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also did the cinematography for Speed, Lethal Weapon 4, and Devil's Advocate. The plot, what there is of it, deals with police corruption, and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and doesn't make any sense---but by that time you've stopped caring. You've seen all of this before---done better. Worst of all, Seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero; he's reached that wheezing, shortness of breath stage that afflicted Roger Moore back in "View to a Kill"---except Seagall doesn't have the acting chops that Moore was able to fall back on. Tom Arnold is thrown in for laughs, but the laughs are so feeble, and the jokes so stale, that you're laughing *at* Arnold and Seagall---not with them. Midway through "Exit Wounds" I was fighting to stay awake, and that's a shame, given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer, hectic energy than any movie I've seen since "Face/Off". Rent the DVD for that opener if you dare, but if you stay any longer you'll see it's true: Old Action Heroes never die, they just fade away. JS
1	Look out for the Zuni!!! Back in the heyday of Dark Shadows Dan Curtis did some telly movies. Frankenstein with Robert Foxworth, The Norliss Tapes with Roy Thinnes, The Night Stalker with Darren Mcgavin, Scream of the Wolf with Clint Walker and Peter Graves, then eventually went on to do bigger projects like The Winds of War and War and Remembrance with Robert Mitchum. During that salad days of the mid 1970s, he did a nifty "novella" style movie called Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black. He went on to use Black in Burnt Offerings the following year. It's a three story showcase, displaying the varied talents of Black, but it's in the last one where Curtis breaks out and really does something memorable. The first novella tale is "Julie". This tell was never fully fleshed out about a college professor who has dark secrets. Nice quirky ending keeps this one for being average. The second is "Millicent and Therese". After the promise of "Julie", I really expected a bit more from this rather obvious tale. Is good fun, just nothing special. Still a fine showcase for Black to show what she can do. It was just so all totally out there, no twist of the screw to make it more. "Amelia" The final one is based on Richard Matheson's Prey, and it outstanding. Once you see these story you will never forget the Zuni warrior that comes to life. Amelia is totally abused by her possessive and controlling mother. She tries to break these ties that bind, but she is no match. She buys a Zuni doll and it comes to life. No spoiler there. You can see that by the cover. It's the story that is amazing. Black's ending is original and memorable. This was low budget telly movie remember, so accept the quality as not motion picture level. Still a GREAT Halloween movie and tribute to Curtis who died March '' this year
0	Role Model? Far From It Jessica Simpson is a talentless bimbo. She is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model - a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing Brittany and Christina for showing too much skin. We all know now that the hypocritical Jessica Simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right. She is NOT a role model and her songs/tv specials are lower than below average
1	Dance On First, let me start off by saying I think the casting choices for this movie were perfect. I had doubts that the movie would be any good, because I'm not exactly a fan of Jennifer Lopez's acting, but she did a brilliant job playing her part. The movie had great sensual dance seens, and a substantial, interesting storyline to go with it. I'm addicted to dance movies, and anyone who says a dance movie with older people in it can't be good is definitely wrong. Richard Gere was amazing. This movie rocked
1	Jessica is AWESOME!! This is a wonderful DVD of Jess. It shows an *inside view* of Jess' life on tour plus includes several interviews with her as well as songs. I learned alot of info from this CD about Jessica that I did not know previously.....and I thought I knew *it all*??!! I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who is a SERIOUS Jessica Simpson fan and wants to learn more about her. It also gives you an inside *peek* into the Hollywood *biz* and the fast-pace lifestyle Jess lives!!
0	Did I miss something here? I am a great fan of Bernstein's "Candide". I saw the 1974 production twice. My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once. This DVD should have been an excellent performance. Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible. Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image. I assumed it was a really bad recording job. Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy?
0	Game 6: The $500,000 movie - Four strikes, you are out. OUT! Upon the brief trailers and DVD cover that gave me the visuals of this show, I thought I would really enjoy it. It was set 20 years ago during the famous world series made infamous by a single error that ended up keeping the curse alive and putting into motion (later in the series) the Mets (Led by such greats as Lenny Dykstra and Daryl Strawberry) beating the Red Sox (Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, to name a few) in that world series. The error goes down as one of the most famous in all of sports. That, however, is in the foreground, much like the Yankee's world series was (led by Reggie Jackson's heroic and never ending home run hits) in the movie "Son of Sam" serial killing spree of Sam Berkowitz in NYC in the 1970's. At first glance, I thought there was going to be a series of dramatic events that lead up to a climatic conclusion, all the way down to the end when Bill Buckner misses the easy grounder to first base. What we end up getting is one of those movies that tries to execute a series of characters and events in their lives, tie it all together, and have some meaning come out of it. The result is what I should have expected from a movie whose budget is a tenth of what some players make nowadays: Dull, Boring, spinning wheels that get stuck, continue to spin, and lead nowhere. There is nothing poignant, profound, or purposeful with the script of this movie, and if there is, I guess I was to wrapped up in watching the Red Sox let another one slip away. First off, we have a decent cast to say the least: Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., and Catherine O'hara (Home Alone fame) are all actors who have shined in the past and though aren't so much of household names anymore, can still carry their craft to the greatest of limits. The problem is not them. The problem is the script! Michael Keaton is a man about to go through a divorce. His daughter is busier turning the volume up on her walkman (remember, this is 1986, not 2006) and he's seeing a lot of things unravel before his eyes. It doesn't seem to bother him much though, as the character Keaton plays (Nicky Rogan) is a famous playwright in the Big Apple who seems more interested visiting with multiple cab drivers in a day than anything else. The camera is always showing the cabbies ID cards on the dash to make sure we know that they are from the Middle East. STRIKE ONE: This little display doesn't seem to get anything across that has any purpose or direction with the film, and seems not only unnecessary, but also ultimately ANNOYING after about the fourth cab ride. Rogan is about to have a personal drama performed and he's not sure how it's going to be perceived by the masses. STRIKE TWO: Despite all the things outside Rogan saying he's supposed to be worried, scared, or bothered, he doesn't really come across that way. If anything this character acts more like a fake puppet than a man with any emotion, feeling, or personality. He is supposed to be nervous because critic David Schwimmer (Downey Jr.) is going to be the major reviewer of his new play. Schwimmer himself received a bad review or something and is now some sort of Syd Barret (see: Pink Floyd founder/drugs/gone crazy supposedly/left band/becomes artistic recluse) in his apartment and seems to spend most of his time just staring at walls and acting like he's had a lobotomy with a drill that has a low battery. STRIKE THREE: This entire subplot never takes off and despite bringing this character into the foreground, including a standoff with Rogan in Schwimmer's apartment with Rogan's teen daughter half naked on the couch, it just doesn't fly. By this time in the movie I'm saying I don't really care. I'm going to give them one more chance at bat...STRIKE FOUR!: At one point in the movie, Rogan is told he should carry a gun for safety. Okay I'm thinking there will be some Bernard Goetz (see: Bernard Goetz/weird engineer/NY resident/4 would be robbers on subway/Goetz shoots them/becomes cult icon/hero/crazy dude for self defense and gun ownership) type situation brewing. The gun is fired off in Schwimmer's apartment a few times but nobody gets hurt (thankfully, I mean I didn't REALLY want anyone to get hurt). After that (I'll call a BALL ONE! here) Schwimmer and Rogan sit down and start talking because they realize they have something in common that is a stronger bond than most realize: They both are Boston natives, and HUGE Red Sox fans. Rogan's mistress, who happens to be funding his new play, and Rogan's father, who is in ailing health and Rogan visits now and again, make Guest appearances. There are a few bright spots in the movie when things like the already mentioned Red Sox bond come into play, but ultimately this thing is over by the fourth inning. Sure, the fat lady isn't singing yet, but like they said in the special features part of the DVD; The world series wasn't technically over for the Sox in that game, as the loss forced it to game seven in which the Mets ultimately won, but it didn't matter. Every fan knew it was a done deal, despite the hope. In the end Rogan skips his plays debut and ends up offering the cab driver that happens to have her grandson with her (nope, this time its actually someone not from the middle east) to go to a bar and watch the game. The actual footage of the game was fun to watch for this sports fan, though I still feel bad for Buckner, and all the BOSOX fans, when that ball went through his glove and the Mets scored the winning run as a result. Special Features: In trying to be objective to my own criticism of this film, I learned that there were basically two ideas (1986 world series & Playwright vs. Critic showdown) that were eventually melded into one. Although its not a total loss considering the movie did surprisingly only cost half a million dollars to film, its not a gain at all because the script in regard to the playwright vs. critic storyline is way to loose. It never really comes across strong and again, with the exception of the BOSOX tie between the two men, the journey to get there is filled with eccentric drivel and boring dialogue that don't hold up well at all. I understand its an "unconventional film" but that does not excuse it from having a weak script and scenes that are made epic but ultimately deliver nothing of substance in the film. In the end, this sports fan was pleased with the different people involved with the film telling where they were and how they felt when Buckner missed that ball. It's to bad that kind of passion was not put into a stronger script that helped tie the themes and overall storyline together better. Oh yeah, I gave it an extra "strike", and its still here. Sorry, you are outta here! Game OVER! See you on the "Field of Dreams" someday in rerun land.
0	Naughty but clever Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story. Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine
0	Criterion misses the boat on this one I'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because Debbie Harry is in it. It is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers' discretion. Is Debbie Harry real or is she just another "Videodrome" hallucination? I definately wouldn't say this is a "fun" movie either...after watching it I felt dirty and sleazy, like I needed to take a long hot shower. Anyway, since this is the big fancy "Criterion Collection" DVD, one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the TV version of Videodrome shown on on Sci-Fi etc.. But no, instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of VHS! They don't even include the extra scenes as bonus material. What a waste! Unless you are really anxious to hear James Woods commentary (Debbie's on there too, but doesn't talk too much) then I would save myself the extra $25 and just buy the old DVD version
1	Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Three DVD good quality however some of the cartoons I do not care for specificall
1	Love love love this movie I have always been a big fan of Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton, I bought the picture when it first came out on vhs. I think I viewed it to many times because the picture and sound quality began to fade, thus I looked all over the country side for the dvd version to no avail, so I decided to order it from Amazon.com only to find it on the shelf at Target a few weeks later but I don't regret my purchase, thanks guys. I'm sure I will enjoy it for many years to come. It's such a funny and dramatic picture
1	Nearly as good as the grammy winning CD Wow - can these guys play. Lukather the "childish", noisy one, Carlton the "mentor" with lots of elegance. But please: Remember to buy the duo's Grammy Award winning CD "No substitutions" produced buy Steve Vai and Lukather. The CD is even better than the DVD. The song lists are about identical - and Carlton's solo after EXACTLY 8 min.s on the CD is just... FANTASTIC!!!
1	Firefly Joss Whedon does it again! This series combined sci-fi with an old west slant. The characters and storyline developed quickly, but left you wanting more. I'm sorry there was only one season
1	"I'm a mean, green mutha from outer space!" This movie is freakin' WEIRD! Thankfully, I like weird. For the uninitiated, this is a musical about a man-eating plant (voiced by Levi Stubbs of The Four Tops). It must be seen to be believed. Our hero, Seymour, discovers a never-before-seen plant, naming it Audrey II (after his coworker and love interest, Audrey). Turns out, the plant eats humans, as he learns when it drinks his blood. At first, Seymour befriends the plant, who helps him get around Audrey's boy friend, a sadistic dentist (the song about him and pseudo-S&M scene that result are freakin' hilarious!) Eventually, things get out of hand - the plant's uniqueness earns Seymour much fame, even though nobody is aware of the plant's dangers. When the plant eats Seymour's boss, things get out-of-hand, and the final battle between the two is hilarious also - Levi Stubbs offers his amazing pipes, declaring "I'm a mean, green mutha from outer space!" - one of my favorite movie quotes. This movie is a real side-splitter, and must be seen
0	Returned it to the store!! This video/DVD lacks the content it claims it has. It only covers 5 or so letters, and does not focus on the sounds. It is pain-stakingly boring, lacks excitement and did not keep my 20 month old daughter's attention. Even the bonus section that is supposed to teach the letters on the DVD version did not appeal to her. Needless to say, we returned this one to the store. I recommend Leapster's Letter Factory which has taught my daughter the sounds of the letters within 2 weeks and has a bonus interactive letter game
1	DINOSAUR LONGEVITY AND SCIENTIFIC FACT The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	the best movie version I am happy to report that this is not only better than the other movie versions of The Prince and the Pauper, but that it is a very good movie. The 1937 version (a.k.a. "the Errol Flynn version") is quite good, but the ending was boggled by the introduction of an unnecessary and unhelpful delaying action, which was then made worse by being repeated (!), dispelling the high tension of the climactic end. The twins who played the lead were very appealing but were made to speak in a very phony (sickeningly sweet) way. There are also technical limitations, such as the sound quality. I'd give it 4 stars. The 1978 version with an all-star cast had much going for it. The big stars all played their roles well, but the movie was ruined by using a 20 year-old boy to play the 12 year-old Prince. And he was repellant as well. Also, the "rollicking" scenes went on a bit too long and too often. I'd give it 3 stars. Fortunately (and for a change), the screenwriters learned from these past versions and this version is flawless. The story rolled smoothly, not too fast, not slow, without repetitions or unnecessary delays or needless complications. The twins who played the lead were appealing and played their parts well. All of the cast were good. The color, the photography, the music, the sound--all good. The ending was just right. This version also added a coda in which the Prince of Wales kept his various promises made to the several poor people who had been kind to him. Bottom line: Don't miss it. Also, the whole family can enjoy this one.
1	Being There Just a wonderful vehicle for Peter Sellers. It not only illustrates his comedic abilities, but also the strength of his straight acting. There is a wonderful cameo from Shirley Maclaine, and the supporting cast are exactly that. This is a heart-warming, yet on deeper consideration quite sad film - 'What if......?', and I rate it highly
0	A Sad Mess Filled With Missed Opportunities & Lots Of Potential I give this hack job the extra star for the fact that it had some very creepy visuals a handful of jumpy scares & a good idea for a story. How sad is it though when that kind of potential can't crutch the horrible outcome,wich resides in plot-hole central USA,home of the university of bad acting & laughable endings(UBALE). Oh man! Horror fans! "BOO" could have been an excellent new low-budget horror flick if it had a tighter script with a much better ending & included some half decent actors who actually had a grip on there character's. All & all what we are left with is an all over the place mess with some good visuals & scares. So many missed opportunities & so much potential lost. What a sad waste!
1	Great Workout This is a very fast paced workout. It took a couple of times through to learn the routine. Denise doesn't cue all that well. She's very upbeat and energetic and constantly gives words of encouragement. Most people don't like that about her, but I think she is motivating. You definitely work all muscle groups and you'll be sweating with this workout. I'm tired, but invigorated by the end. I enjoyed this workout a lot
0	Uh, like where are the videos I dont understand why they didnt put the videos in like when it was on tv. The videos were the best part! I asume its because mtv didn't want to pay royalties to the bands, so they called it the "Mike Judge Collection" and left them out. Uh, That Sucks
0	10.5 on the unrealistic scale One of the supporting actresses said it best in this movie, "Forget what you saw on TV." The entire disaster is based on, well, make-believe. And to top it off, it appears the only person in the entire country who figured out what is going on has written scientific books that nobody else believes. Everybody else are idiots and have absolutely no idea what to do. In fact, the head of FEMA, who has been placed in charge of overseeing the problems, can't seem to come up with more than one plan. He draws a complete blank when asked for a contingency plan. And then there is the entire nuclear warhead thing is just laughable and a complete ripoff of Armagedon. The only thing missing was Bruce Willis. The only thing that was promised and delivered was the special effects. It actually wasn't all that bad for a made-for-TV movie. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can come up wtih. The acting was silly, the dialogue was horrocious, the length was way too long, and the reality wasn't existent. All in all, I would not recommend this unless you are really into disaster flicks (which my wife is and why I ended up watching it myself).
1	Grab the Tissue This is a love story personified. And I am sure this goes on in real life every minute of every day. This is what LOVE really is. . . . in sickness and in health till death us do part. And I do not believe it ends there. So if you want to know what LOVE really is - watch this movie or read the book. It is fantastic
0	Bridges of Madison County DVD The DVD was okay and I needed it for a gift (which I was late for - my fault). I received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed. It was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing. The outside of the package was marred but not ripped open. But when I opened it I was horrified that the entire case was crushed. I delicately took it apart and it seemed that the DVD was untouched so I put it in another generic case that I had around the house. That was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and I couldn't fit it in my case. Because I was late with my gift, I didn't have time to send it back to you. The price was right, the service was quick, just bulk up on your shipping a little
0	If you want the real deal go region 2 I'm amazed that the US still has to put up with this half baked rush release, If you want the fully realised package with English sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version ISBN B000BY9ALU. OK so it'll probably cost you twice as much and you'll need a multi region player. But for something this good why put up with second best. This is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on, as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused. It continues the theme from GITS 1 querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking. At times it gets a touch pretentious with Batou and Togusa swapping obscure quotations, but it is both beautiful and thought provoking. Again a split review 5 for the film, 2 for the slipshod DVD release
1	Enthusiastic If Not Gay The professional reviewer missed the main point of Jeffrey's dilemma. He's not so afraid of getting AIDS; he's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it. Most people figure a 50% chance of dying before their spouse; but taking on a person with a known, fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate, poignant situation. Steve Weber is no gayer than George Bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser. This was the first film I saw Michael Weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay. I knew Patrick Stewart isn't, but his performance is dead on. Overall, a very funny movie with a big, big heart
1	My kids loved this I showed excerpts from this series to my ninth-grade science classes and got lots of positive feedback. My own kids liked it as well. Lots of good "probable case scenarios." Will drive creationists crazy.
1	"Sometimes truth defies reason." The Meiks brothers had a troubled childhood. Very troubled. Their mother had died after Adam was born, leaving his older brother Fenton to take care of him with the help of their father. The three males seemed to fend well for themselves, not running into too many bumps in their simple yet strange road in life. It was a fairly close-knit family with plenty of pleasant memories and more to come. But all of that changed one night when Dad (curiously, his name was never revealed in the film, being credited as "Dad Meiks") rushed into the boys' room, flipped on the light, woke them up, and began to unravel an unusual tale that would change the very course of their lives in a most dramatic way. Dad had been visited by an angel - an angel sent by God himself. The heavenly apparition told him of his new calling: to be a destroyer of demons. According to the angel, the biblical end times had come and there were demons of Hell now walking among mortal man, disguised as humans. Dad would be given sacred weapons from the angel soon, and thereafter he would receive a list. The list held the names of the demons in disguise - names that appeared to be mere human identities, but, just like the demons themselves, were simply cover-ups for the true evil that lurked in their soul. It was now up to this family of three to become warriors of God. The young Adam obeyed his father and came to believe every bit of it. But Fenton was disturbed by these ideas, insisting to himself that his father had lost his mind and nothing this crazy could be real. Yet surely enough, step by step, it all began becoming a reality. The main slaughtering weapon had been retrieved - an abandoned axe in an old shed, with gloves by its side. They came to find out, that the gloves were for Dad to use when capturing the demons and bringing them back to the house. Because when he would remove the gloves and touch them with his bare hands, he could see their dark sin nature and know for sure who they really were. They weren't humans of course, they were pathetic demons - no match for the wrath of God that was being handed out through this divinely chosen man and his sons. At first Fenton wanted to run away and get help. But as time moved on, trapped within this world of madness and extremism, he began to question his reality as a whole. Could he brake away from this terrible mess he'd been drawn into, or was he destined to become a demon-slayer, just as his father was, and just as his brother would come to be? Years later, as a full-grown adult, he gets a frantic phone call from his brother. Shortly after, he decides to give FBI agent Wesley Doyle a visit and finally relieve himself of these secrets that have plagued him all his life. At first Doyle is confused as to why he would come to him to reveal the mystery behind the "God's Hand" serial killer case. Yet once he unveils this deranged tale and the story progresses, they take a trip to the burial site of the victims, where reality warps and warps until it all comes into focus. It turns out that the truth is more twisted than the viewer could have ever imagined. 2001's Frailty is a dark web beautifully spun by it's makers and deserves a look from any and every fan of suspense and horror films. It's a clever, disturbing, thought-provoking piece with plenty of twists and turns that will leave you impressed - if not a bit creeped out! Starring Bill Paxton, Mathew McConaughey, and Powers Booth (among others) you can be assured that the acting really brings out the depth and haunting minds of the characters. And with a great script and crew work, it's no wonder why this is one of the best films in years for fans of the genre. Not to mention several nice extras on the DVD (including deleted scenes, documentaries/featurettes, and commentary by director/actor Bill Paxton). For sure, Frailty is a winner all the way
1	Awesome cult horror comedy! In the streets of New York City where the homeless live in a junkyard and on the streets, two bum brothers named Fred (Mike Lackey) and Kevin ( Mark Sferrazza) are living together in a hut of a auto-wreck place thinking that their lives have become crap for them. A liquor store owner however discovers in his store a old box of special liquor called "Vipor" that is 40 years old and sells them for a buck, unfortunately it has a bad side effect on those who drink it would literally melt or explode. An original, tasteless, and entertaining horror comedy has gained a cult following since it was released in 1987, sure the acting can be bad but the movie has awesome gore, melting and body explosion make-up effects with a dark sense of humor to help the flick. There's also some nudity for those who love nudity, nicely photographed and also star R.L. Ryan ( the actor who played the fat mayor on "The Toxic Avenger") as a boss. The DVD has sharp picture and nice sound quality as the only extra is the theatrical trailer, this is a must have DVD for fans of horror comedies, gore flicks, Troma movies and Peter Jackson's early works. Also recommended: "The Toxic Avenger", "C.H.U.D.", "Dead Alive ( a.k.a. Braindead)", "Class of Nuke'Em High", "The Incredible Melting Man", "Day of the Dead", "Re-Animator", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky", "Tetsuo The Iron Man", "The Stuff", "An American Werewolf in London", "Cabin Fever", "Videodrome", "Caligula", "The New York Ripper", "Maniac (1980)", "Land of the Dead", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2", "Shogun Assassin", "Rabid Grannies", "Ichi The Killer", "Tromeo and Juliet", "Terror Firmer", "Ninja Scroll", "Robocop", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "High Tension", "Friday The 13th series", " Freddy Vs.

0	The novel would be better Harold Ramis's "The Ice Harvest" wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst, but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires. All the ingredients are there, but ultimately the movie lacks spice. In some movies, it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - "Nobody's Fool," for example. But a dark comedy needs some pep, and "The Ice Harvest" doesn't have it. A lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors. He is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues, like in "High Fidelity" and "Say Anything." Here, Cusack's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he's made as a leading man, and that's a shame. Billy Bob Thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes, but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt. The same with the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he's enjoyable on-screen, but when he's not there, we miss him. The bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies. None of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of "The Ref," for example. The movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits. Instead, we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke "Fargo" or "A Simple Plan," but doesn't get anywhere close. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments that I won't spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time. But all in all, the movie is a downer, and when the winners are finally revealed at the end, it feels less like a triumph than it does a ho-hum conclusion. Throughout the movie, I kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters . . . there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves. Petty crime can be highly enjoyable, but not in "The Ice Harvest."
0	Total Electric Borefest I owned the original VHS version...I quickly gave it to a friend of mine, free of charge. Eric Johnson may be considered a guitar great (I don't get it), but he has the personailty of a shoelace and it is aptly demonstrated in this instructional video. Some people just aren't good teachers, no matter how great a guitarist they are. As an added bonus, his guitar is drenched in reverb throught the entire video, even during specific examples & demos! Say what? Finally, the length of the video was way too long (or at least it felt that way. It took repeated viewings for me to get therough from start to finish). Throw in a mind-numbing finale/lecture about patch cables, cable length, pick gauge, strings, theories on physics and you get Eric Johnson: Total Electric Guitar - Agonizing to watch & absolutely God-awful. Stick w/ Brian Setzer (THE rockabilly instructional bible), James Burton (Hello.....Elvis' guitarist!), Yngwie J.(THE only instructional video you need for precision shredding), Danny Gatton (1 & 2: encyclopidias of all styles) or B.B. King: Bluesmaster (extremely in-depth analysis/demos of B.B.'s style by B.B.) Instructional videos/DVDs. Even if it's not your style, these are highly informative, educational & entertaining. I highly recommend these
1	One of my favorite movies Incredibly well directed, put us into a wonderful world of dreamlike desires, anguishes and hopes. Fellini's movies always talk the language of the unconscious mind
0	Not a "Killer back" workout I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas. The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play. But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back. In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form. A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn. A good abs and waist workout as well. There are alot of twisting moves. The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one. Michael only performs half of the exercises himself. He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention. I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience. He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout. But its easy to manage without them.
1	Good job on a Great Story but the Goliath encounter was awful Excellent story and they followed most of it fairly accurately. Good job with the repercussions of David's adultery and how it affected his entire household for a long time thereafter. The dynamics of the sons were well-done with only minor omissions in the plot here and there but not enough to damage the story badly... except in the case of Goliath. With all the information about the account you'd think they could get one detail right but I'm not sure any aspect of it was accurate. First of all, they show Goliath no larger than anyone else. Also, there is no real context of a war and battle here... Goliath is just ambushing Saul's soldier's a couple at a time. There is no forty days of taunts, David is already here, and Saul is about to bravely charge off to face Goliath (never showing the least fear of Goliath) when David says to let him. He doesn't even try on Saul's armor (though Saul mentions it while ridiculing David about the impossibility of David fighting). The only other major issue I recall was the presence of some excessive spirituality. For example, when Saul is overcome by the Spirit he never prophecies, he just dances rather provocatively (a similar presentation when David dances but it is at least slightly more accurate in David's case). I'm not counting the Witch of Endor scene in that, since it is supposed to be spiritualistic- as per general suppositions, her spiritualistic nature is extremely freaky and witch-like with her screaming and chanting and so forth [but try to remember all witchcraft is not so blatant]). Remember these are wars and adultery, etc. and they are true to the Biblical account in that sense so they are not meant for family viewing
0	A disappointment in a way... For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon
1	No way out A perfect movie. A truthfull face of the world of sales and what happens when your back is against the wall. Jack Lemmon's best performance
0	Kill Me Now. Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film. It's so aggravating. I want to chew my own leg off half way into it. I know part of it is everyone is a "talker" of a various sort. They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell. I just don't think it works. Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived. The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves. It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name. Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen.
0	THE MIRACLE OF ... WHAT? This is my first time in this forum I've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLE AS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist. I choose the first option. Are you so kind -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ? Yours R
0	Terence Hill, Bud Spencer, Lionel Stander in the west. Also known as Trinity Rides Again/ La Collina degli stivali. The print of this 1969 Italian western film is very poor. Grainy and greenish sometimes. Right away you will notice that Terence Hill and Lionel Stander (A Star Is Born [1937], Hart To Hart tv series [1979-84], Hart To Hart tv-movies [1993-96] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else. Sometimes you hear Stander's real voice. Stander plays a circus ringmaster. With his assistance he will help Terence and Bud Spencer take down the bad guys in the west. Difficult film to enjoy without Terence Hill's real voice. Victor Buono also in the film
0	Unfinished The film looks unfinished. The animations are uncompleted and the film struggles to hold a story running. However; it has some interesting sci-fi features which makes the film worth watching... If you are a sci-fi fan with waaay to much spare time; that is
0	emminently skippable Add me to the folks who thought this would continue the storyline and were disappointed. There's really no reason to get this one unless you just want to own them all. All of the footage is cut from older episodes with a few extra bits of dialogue added. Wish I'd checked for reviews before picking it up.
0	South Park: The Down Years Definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten. Adults beware. These guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes. I hope Trey and Parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons. Besides the smugness, I am tired of all the voices in South Park sounding all too similar.
0	poor quality piece, but... i was extremely disappointed with this dvd, in both content and quality. i expected a wider range of archival video footage from his preformances and some selections are in fact taken from same performances. fourteen live performace songs is an extreme understatement of his ability to capture his audiences, be it for a television broadcast or live concert. the anthology is padded with distracting talking head video footage taken from the documentary and the fades between frames were less then desired. but... the "bonus" documentary was redeeming. "half mile a day" is definitely the stronger half of this dvd; perhaps the documentary should in fact be the primary material with the anthology being the "bonus" selection. i ranked this dvd at two stars because i purchased it for the performance footage and not the documentary
0	The book is fascinating; the movie fails it. I'm a retired attorney. I enjoy crime novels and the movies that bring them to us visually. However, this movie simply is a pain to watch, IF one enjoyed the drama of the book. The book "Blood Work" is very detailed and the solution to the "who done it" is very well hidden. I won't bore you with details but if you want to know how the movie compares with the novel, read the review by "km southern" dated Oct 19, 2004, that is available below. She is right on. The movie has so many flaws that even without having read the book upon which it purports to be based, it is a poor choice
0	Awful, incoherent mess. This movie's only redeeming quality is the visual effects... as an artist, I have to admire their efforts. But other than that, the movie is just unwatchably bad. There just isn't a coherent plot. The movie jumps from place to place, throwing in random events that leave you staring in confusion at the screen. Every time you think the story has settled down from its bizarre wandering, another case of poor editing shows up to shatter that illusion. Add in bad acting, awful "humor", and you'll be looking at your clock wondering how much more you have to sit through
1	Interesting in that...creepy kind of way. John Hawkes is Richard Swersey, a recently separated shoe salesman and father of two boys, in this story of just a few of life's most basic, yet complicated relationships. Richard struggles with the separation from his wife until he meets Christine, an eccentric artist who doesn't starve only because she chauffeurs the elderly. Richard's sons find love, one conversationally on the internet, and the other physically from the neighborhood girls who want to experiment with him. The movie was written and directed by Miranda July who also starred in the film as Christine. I thought it was good, but not great. I loved the incorporation of the name of the movie into the theme of the story. I thought that was great. I enjoyed the well-written dialogue. It was certainly an interesting film, just not the most entertaining. Some parts of the movie seemed to move too slowly, though I can appreciate that, to an extent, it was done on purpose (see also: artistically). The movie received some pretty harsh reviews from family and friends, but I am happy I still took the time to see it. I had hoped to catch it in the theater, but was glad to finally see it once and for all on DVD.
1	Great Chess Story Probably the only available good chess movie. (There are a bunch on other sports but not on chess) Worth watching if you like chess, atleast once
1	Witness the greatest moments in A's history ! This DVD is great for any A's fan or just baseball fans in general. This DVD has 4 seperate films you can choose from on the main screen that document that year's world series. These were also made in the year that the series was played. I enjoyed seeing the footage of A's greats like Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Vida Blue, Terry Steinbach, Mark McGwire, Dave Stewart, and Blinkie McBlinkerson.....errr I mean Jose Canseco
0	Cheap Switcheroo... Originally placed the order for the non-Thinpak release as Amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the "new" slimline Thinpak. Seems MGM decided not to release this box set in the original style; annoying to say the least. They've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style. SG-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases (Season 9 & 10)?? This is not unlike the Simpson's box sets which were changed in season 5 to "head shots" of Simpsons characters. After much protest, their distributor came out with original box set-style releases. Smaller package... less inserts... looks puny on the DVD rack next to the other EIGHT seasons... same price. Gotta love that marketing plan! I'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes MGM will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school
0	I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. I like Marlee Matlin and some of the other DVDs in the Baby Einstein series so was looking forward to this one. It is unfortunately not that great for teaching sign language (I prefer both "My Baby Can Talk" and "Signing Time"). The worst part of it is how long a child has to wait for the actual content; there is no way to skip the COMMERCIAL for "Disney's Little Einsteins"
0	Disney needs to get it together! For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world. Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a "Special Edition" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement
0	Just Another Heist Movie &quot;Heist&quot; is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a &quot;who fools who?&quot; picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid
1	Sadly Overlooked Action Adventure Comedy Christian Slater's character reminds me of a young Jack Nicholson, who replaces his brother on the Police Force after he is murdered. I was surprised that he didn't become as popular as Tom Cruise after this film was released in 1992, but he had a few personal issues during the 90s that stalled his career. I think he's a better actor than most people realize, with much more talent than making below average movies like "Broken Arrow".
0	Euuuwww......Creepy! This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!
1	Moving and inspiring, not matter what the final verdict was... I've heard a lot good and a lot bad about this film. I don't think anyone can deny the power in Denzel's brilliant performance, but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned, it's been judged harshly for it. I personally don't know the truth behind this mans conviction, his innocence and his quilt, only he knows, but the portrait painted by this film portrays Rubin `The Hurricane' Carter as a victim of a corrupt system. To me it's a very moving film, regardless if it's true or not, and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom. Denzel delivers his finest performance here; a well deserved Oscar nomination, and proves that he is a very talented actor. I am a fan of Denzel, although I've made my concern very clear (the fact that Denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters), and I feel he shines here. Despite the constant criticism, I feel this is a must-see film, if not for the emotional, albeit somewhat fictionalized (or assumed is a better word since no one really knows), story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved. Dan Hedeya does a great job as the crooked (fictional) detective who makes it his life goal to punish Rubin for a crime he committed as a child (a crime that should never have been considered a crime) and Vicellous Reon Shannon does wonderfully as Lesra, the young man who not only fights for Rubin's freedom but helps Rubin to regain the hope and life he once had. Like I said, very heartwarming and touching, and regardless of whether or not Rubin was guilty or innocent, the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from Lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see
1	"Is This A Kissing Story?" I'm a big fan of fantasy films from the 1980s, and after reviewing a couple here on amazon, this particular DVD came up. "Looks a bit girly," I thought, and so did my brother when he came over and spotted it on the coffee table. But for the most part "The Princess Bride", is actually fun for both boys and girls, and for viewers of all ages. A boy (Fred Savage from "The Wonder Years") is sick in bed, so his Granpa (Peter Falk) comes to visit him. He's brought a book for them to read together called "The Princess Bride", a book that's been in the family for generations, and has always cheered the family up when they're sick. The boy is put off by the name, but decides to humour his grandpa and lets him read. His grandpa tells a tale of a peasant girl, Buttercup, (Robin Wright) who falls deeply in love with a farm boy named Westley (Cary Elwes), only to be heartbroken when he goes on a trip, apparently killed by pirates on the way. Buttercup vows never to love again, but these words don't stop the prince of Florin from taking her hand in marriage. Before the wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a Sicilian, then counter-kidnapped by a fear some "dread-pirate". But things are not as they appear, love that was thought to be dead is actually alive, and many an adventure and story are had, in this land full of monstrous eels, giant rats, fire-swamps, giants, six-fingered swordsmen and horrible instruments of torture. Though there is a little bit of romance and melodrama in the film, it is a fairly light hearted piece. Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun. The score, which is mostly GM-like keyboard tones, by Mark Knopfler adds to the goofiness of things, though it is a tender track when it needs to be. The sets and costumes are pretty nice too, as is the character development. There's a couple of cameo appearances in the film as well, (like Billy Crystal as a "Miracle Worker") so keep an eye out. Worth a look for fans of fantasy and of romantic comedy. Don't be put off by the title, it's a lot more than (as Fred Savage's character puts it) a "kissing story"
0	just ok the show lost it's zip by season 7. the chemistry wasn't the same. the scripts had gotten watered down&you could sense a show just going through the motions on quite a few of these episodes.the show had it's last real peak during Season 4.i still enjoy watching the show though
0	Most boring idiotic pointless anime I've ever watched Nothing happens. Nothing! You watch for...what 5 to 6 hours to discover the rediculus "blue" is just here to wipe out the earthlings because of overpopulation. Big Deal! Anyone who gives this thing a more than two don't know what story telling is all about. Soon as I can I'm getting rid of this crap. You don't want to be bored silly by a pointless story that goes nowhere don't get this thing.
1	What HD is All About! I purchased an HD-DVD player with this title in mind and it doesnt disappoint. This is by far one of the very best HD-DVD's on the market to date and even tho the brand is somewhat new, that is still saying something as there are a bunch of beautiful releases already. This is without a doubt a reference quality disc both in terms of the picture, Audio and in terms of extras and what the HD format can do that regular DVD's cant. First the picture and what a picture it is. It is a flawless transfer with absolutly stunning detail. The amount of grain is perfect with no noticable noise & no edge enhancment was visable throught the entire film. The skin tones are beautiful and the colors accurate. One of the most impressive aspects of the picture is the rendition of the color black. Black levels are perfect with plenty of detail seen in the shadows. The scene where he is spraypainting his batsuit with the black spraypaint has to be seen to be believed. I dont think I have ever seen the color black presented so perfectly in a home movie before and there are alot of dark scenes in this film so that is one of the reasons why this transfer is so beautiful. There isnt a single thing I would change with the picture. My hats off to the people that were in charge of this transfer, its one of the best I have ever seen. As for the audio, the Dolby Digital Plus track is amazing but the TrueHD track is where this baby really takes off. if you own the Toshiba A1 you need to update to the 2.0 firmware udate to be able to use the TreHD and its everybit worth updating. The Batman begins soundtrack is an awsome one in general, very heavy in bass it just a wonderful mix that adds an extra oopmh to the action scenes like any good soundtrack should. On the TrueHD track it sounded simply stunning. Dialogue was easily heard without sacrificing any of the other sounds and effects. Overall its the best TrueHD track so far and that again is saying something as Training Day had an awsome TrueHD track, it just couldnt beat out the power this soundtrack had. As for the extras, were presented with all of the extras from the 2 disc special edition plus the HD-DVD exclusive IME track (In-Movie Experience). There were some people who complained that this IME track wasnt as good as some of the others because some of the pauses between speakers were fairly long. I have to 100% disagree with this. When people on the IME track are speaking non stop and the IME track runs non stop you are never really given a chance to get into the movie as all of your attention is focused on the IME screen. With Batman Begins they made it so the IME track was active during the less important and less exciting scenes and inactive during the exciting and important scenes. What this did was allow you to actually get involved with the movie while at the same time get information from the IME track during the more boring and less important parts of the movie. They absolutly did this on purpose and you can tell alot of thought went into when the IME should be active and when it shouldnt. In the end it was unlike anything I have ever experinced before with a commentary track and when the movie was over I had felt like I had not only just seen the IME track but I had also watched the movie. It was awsome and really has me sold on IME. I thought that IME might be kind of gimmicky when Ifirst got into HD-DVD but it couldnt be farther from the truth. IME is the future of commentary tracks and there really is no comparison between IME and the old style of commentary. So to sum this up, Batmen Begins is a must buy if you own a HD-DVD player. Its one of the best super hero movies ever made and this HD-DVD transfer is the best it has ever looked. Put a big dose of amazing sound and a big dose of IME on top of that and you have what is arguably the best release so far for HD-DVD. Its releases like this that make me happy I got into HD-DVD right off the bat without worrying about the damned format war. as long as HD-DVD keeps performing at this level, I will be an HD-DVD supporter till the end.

0	Painful. Half Light (Craig Rosenberg, 2006) I've been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards, and it's brought a somewhat related (if tangentially) point into focus for me: why it is that movies like Darkness, the 2002 Spanish "thriller" with all the suspense of a Pee Wee Herman monologue, and Haute Tension, France's painfully bad 2005 attempt at horror, come over to America and fall flat. Well, I knew the answer, but really, you're all providing me with more evidence. You've never seen a good horror film in your life, have you? Because that's really the only way I can see justifying Darkness, Haute Tension, or Half Light as marginal, much less good, movies. Demi Moore plays Rachel Carlson, an American author living in Scotland with her husband Brian (Henry Ian Cusick) and their son Thomas (the wonderfully-named Beans el-Balawi, recently in the TV adaptation of Beneath the Skin). Thomas suffers a household accident, which leads to Rachel and Brian splitting up. Rachel's friend Sharon (Coupling's Kate Isitt) finds Sharon a lovely, secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write (and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded, where they're bound to be tormented by guilt?). Rachel meets a number of fine locals, including Angus McCulloch (The Mists of Avalon's Hans Matheson), keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place, with whom she feels an instant attraction. Despite being free of the marriage bond, Rachel's not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger... ...and neither are we. There's obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters, but it's never realized. It's probably off looking for the film's suspense, which Rosenberg reminds us we're supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie clichï¿½ in the entire book. Once you've figured out the movie's big twists (yes, there's more than one, handled with all the delicacy afforded to, say, a road being repaved), which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film, Rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end. There's only one problem-- the movie's climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film's resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied. (Go look at the film boards in various places. There is one question that crops up over and over again. It relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across.) It's not often that I say Darkness is better than another horror film. After all, Darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible. But if you have died and gone to Hell, and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity, Darkness should be a no-brainer. Yes, this one's that bad.
1	Time goes by so slowly ... or so fast ... or backwards... or forwards The third installment of our favorite wizard has him meeting a new defense of the dark arts teacher ... along with some rather scary gatekeepers as the magical world hunts for Sirius Black ... Harry's godfather who has escaped from the dreaded Azkaban prison. Meanwhile Hermione discovers a way to time travel with a special locket and take more classes. It is definitley getting darker and darker ... but this third in a series sets the tone for Harry's destiny
0	This loosely disguised "show" is nothing but a mouthpiece for the liberal agenda of broken marriages, pedophilia, & infidelity!! This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness; the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal "values"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to "freshen" its stale storyline. At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives "intellectually" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, "alternative" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young. This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him. By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his "alternative" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection. Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally. To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their "performances" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed. In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony.
1	Heavenly!!! I've watched this 5 times in the past month by sharing it with everybody. Even my country/western fan son loved it
1	WOW, I think it's worth buying!!! I bought this season coupple of days ago, and WOW, is all I haver to say. It seems like the shows are longer, better acting (well some scence), and I like the scenes where they had edited them in the tv broadcast. If you are a Knight Rider fan like mylself, then this should be in your collection!!
1	The fFrst World War,Harbinger of a tumultuous century With present day footage masterfully juxtiposed with much,heretofore unseen,period film, this multi-disc history of the Great War breathes life into the first quarter of the twentieth century unlike an i've seen thus far. We are shown how the echoes of events that occured nearly a century ago still resonate with deafening clarity in our twenty-first century lives. The mistakes which plunged the world into a decades long bloodbath are laid out in a way that describes, in riveting detail, the follies and grave consequenses of cavalier militarism. This series is neither dry or pedantic but illumunates facts with which everyone should be acquainted. Perhaps we can avoid a repetition of this debacle
0	No Closed Captions! The film I bought at a retail outlet in Spokane WA contains no closed captions! If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it. The box should have contained a clear message: No Closed Captions! (Parenthetically, Amazon.com's description indicates the film IS Closed Captioned.) The content of the film is shallow, and it doesn't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported Greenwald film, Walmart, the High Cost of Low Price. If closed captions are not an issue, however, buy (or rent) *both* films to draw your own conclusion. Obviously, the truth about Walmart's impact on US cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films. I found the Greenwald film much more convincing
0	I wish I could have rated it 0 star I decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it. I watched it with my girlfriend. Bad idea... The sex scenes are bad and very short, and the rest is downright boring. This movie is simply bad, and slow, and generally laughable
1	This version is much better I purchased the first version eagerly when it was released. Since then I've purchased the rest of the seasons and was relieved when they started making the slim more compact packaging. I also noticed there were some flaws in the first set of DVD's like no intro music and some other glitches that didn't match the others. The first version has 9 full size DVD boxes and only 4 episodes per DVD. It's like they had to work out the kinks. It took me a long time to decide to purchase the "new" First season because I already paid $95.00 for it the first time, but I am glad I did. They added in a colorized intro section with Ricky singing "I Love Lucy" that I just love. Not to mention it's smaller and matches my collection. If your're trying to decide which First season to buy, this is the one. It has the same great first season eposides and extras, smaller, more episodes per DVD and the price is so right!
0	never did get it. sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost 1 year later i still havent gotten the book, a response from amazon, or a response from the shipper
0	Blech...Horrible! What a disaster! This movie is a complete waste of time from start to finish. The animation is ugly, horrible, and unrealistic and the three stories are bland and boring. What was Disney thinking? Oh, I know! "Let's see if we can eek a little more cash out of Cinderella. Who cares if we destroy a beloved classic?" Several main characters are completely different from the original movie and it makes no sense. In the first story, the King has turned from a happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into a stuffy, sour old curmudgeon. Suddenly there's a rule about no commoners in the palace? Uh...isn't there a line in the original about "every eligible maiden in the kingdom?" The palace was FULL of commoners that night. The story picks up as the Prince and Cinderella return from their honeymoon, so in the space of a few weeks, the King has completely changed. I guess they weren't creative enough to come up with anything that would stay true to the characters. The other two stories are equally nauseating and are not worth my time to review or your time to read. Avoid this mess of a movie. The really sad thing is that "ugly, horrible, unrealistic animation and bland and boring stories" pretty much describes any Disney sequel or direct-to-video slop on the market
1	Mrs. Parker Would Be Proud Dorothy Parker was a woman tragically ahead of her time. She wrote with real honesty and wit about what it felt like to be a woman in a man's world, and her acerbic tongue became legendary. Dorothy Parker was also a lonely woman who was profoundly unhappy all her life, failed twice at marriage and suicide, and loved her friend and colleague Robert Benchley all her life, never acting on her desire for him. "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" does a wonderful job of depicting Dorothy Parker's life on film. It shows Parker young and vibrant in the 1920's, which are filmed in color, and then slowly fading into alcoholism in the 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. The latter sequences are shot in black and white, which is a fascinating way to structure the film. As the color drains from Dorothy's life, it drains from the screen as well. Director Alan Rudolph, who also wrote the screenplay, does a wonderful job of evoking the period of New York and Hollywood in the 20's and 30's. Jennifer Jason Leigh is an extremely versatile actress, and she excels as Dorothy Parker. She looks, sounds, and acts so much like the real Mrs. Parker, especially in the scenes when she recites some of Parker's most autobiographical poetry. Leigh plays Dorothy as a woman who simply understood life too well, and was never able to be happy. When younger, she tried to be, but as the years roll on, you can see Dorothy slowly giving up, finally allowing herself to be forgotten. In a pivotal scene towards the end of the film, a psychiatrist tells Dorothy that she needs to face her pain more directly. Tears rollong down her face, she replies "Face it more directly? I face it every day. I fall in love with married men, but I do it purpose. I drink too much, but that's because I'm thirsty. I think my version of pain is more fun than yours." Leigh gives a brave, intense performance as Dorothy Parker, and she deserved more recognition for her work than she got. Campbell Scott is also excellent as Robert Benchley, the fellow writer that Dorothy loved. Benchley was a married man, and the two never became intimate, although they loved each other deeply. "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" is not always an easy film to watch because it depicts a brilliant and vulnerable woman slowly drowning in her own unhappiness, with no hope that things will ever get better. In life, Parker regarded herself a failure as a writer, and died alone and forgotten at the age of 74. Her one wish was to die on a cloudy, rainy day. True to her luck, on the day of her death the sun was shining
1	Perfect Platinum Edition and worth collecting to all Bambi fans! When I first saw the cover of this special edition, I anticipated that it would be the best ever. When I received and watched it, I found it was perfect, even better off than my anticipation! It was perfect, glorious, wonderful, splendid, fantastic... Oh, I think it can be described with many, many good words! When I received this special edition, I was a little disappointed to the surface of the discs, because the pattern on them were not so pretty. But needless to say, the movie is, and will always be classic. However, in this special edition, the movie tableaux became more clear, but, in my opinion, the original tableaux were better, because they gave me very classic feeling. I had watched this movie when I was very, very young, and I had almost forgotten what was it about! But now, this platinum edition reminded me not only the plots of the movie but also some beautiful memories in my childhood! Just as my anticipation, many wonderful things were in disc 2! My favourite parts were Deleted Scenes and The Making of Bambi. Bambi was one of the cutest Disney characters in my opinion, and through these 2 parts, I knew how Bambi was created and something I've never known about Bambi. The part which attracted me most was The Legacy Continues, the trailer of "Bambi-2". I was excited to see this! If it wasn't for this, I wouldn't know "Bambi-2" which was so wonderful would be published! The part which entertained me much was the personality profile game called What's Your Season. Just like the fact, my season is summer, my favourite season! And the animated short named The Old Mill was so beautiful too! There were many interesting and attractive things in this 2-disc special edition, everything in it will entertain you much. It will make you to love this beloved movie more and more! And I think it will make you to wait for "Bambi-2" expectantly
0	Very unhappy I have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by DHL Global Mail. This is a ridiculous and unacceptable situation. I will never use Amazon again, I feel cheated
1	If only... Wouldn't it be interesting if we could see what would happen if we just made that train, missed that flight, or accepted that invitation, etc. Some things may happen by chance but are not coincidence. I love this movie and have always referred to it since seeing it when it first came out. After so many years, I felt it should be in my movie library. Enjoy
0	Disappointed by Quality and Images I purchased video for my 14 month old and was really disappointed by this video. First, it claimed to tell the story of Noah's Ark but it was just a bunch of random images loosely tied with a few quotes about Noah. My daughter watched the video half-way though (which is not so bad) but in general, prefers Baby Noah by Baby Einstein and Noah's Ark by Baby Miracle. While the video has a few pretty images, I do not recommend it. Hope my review is helpful.
0	How did Platoon miss the cut? One would have to be a glutton for punishment to sit through this many Oliver Stone movies in a row. But, I see Stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer, unless you count his homage to Fidel Castro. The only movies worth watching are his early movies, Salvador and Platoon, which for some reason didn't make the cut. Instead, you have the insufferable Born on the Fourth July and his conspiracy theories on the death of JFK, with a whole lot of filler in between
0	mind numbingly boring repetition After seeing the first series, I thought (hoped) that intelligence had started to find it's way back to humor. With the second series, I see that I was wrong. Horribly wrong. In the former, we were introduced to these characters, and with each new scene, a new quirk or tidbit was released to us. In the latter, there is no development at all. It is formulaic. The characters basically do the same thing, again and again, without even much of a change in scenery. Messrs. Walliams and Lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least, which I find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail. Perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them. It certainly seems that they have stopped caring. If you like to "parrot" characters verbatim, play drinking games by shouting out what's coming next in a scene, or find that you've been attracted to Saturday Night Live post 1979, you might like this. I was acutely disappointed
1	Hilarious Example Of How Deadly-Funny Dark Satire Can Be The bite to this movie comes from its near-perfect insight into what high school, overachievers, bored teachers, society, competitive people, politics, and marriages mired in ennui are all about. It's smart, it's incredibly funny, and it gets the most out of a very good cast. Election, set in the 1990's at a school outside Omaha, tells the story of a frightening human dynamo, a senior who wishes to cap off her near-perfect career in high school by being elected to the student counsel presidency. As played by Reese Witherspoon, Tracy Flick (whose last name spelled several times in the movie all in capital letters---"FLICK"---looks suggestively like another word) sees the office as the next logical step in her sociopathic upward climb toward a full scholarship to Georgetown. Tracy has a single-mindedness that borders on mental illness, and a ruthlessness powered by a vicious drive that at times seems genuinely scary to behold. This uber-overachiever has been top of the honor roll for years, and has headed a number of extracurricular clubs, from being editor of the school yearbook to...you name it. She has also destroyed the life and reputation of a teacher who grew carelessly fond of her, and before Election is done she does-in another, here played by Matthew Broderick. Broderick's social sciences teacher, Mr. McAllister, senses the destructive force Tracy let loose on post-high school society might become, and he makes it his mission to sabotage her bid to become class president. First McAllister convinces the school's dopey star athlete, played Chris Klein, to oppose Tracy in the election, and later McAllister crosses the line and uses his position as head of the election committee to make certain Tracy loses. The meltdowns that occur to several key characters in Election are at times played off as funny but more than once the makers of this movie were courageous enough to let them be disturbing, particularly the scene where Tracy, believing the outcome of the election has not been in her favor, breaks down emotionally, revealing the insecure, needy figure beneath her extroverted exterior. Election is comedy at its smartest. The writing is polished, the delivery of these stunningly perfect lines is flawless, and the humor mixes cerebral parody with at times a fun version of crudity. It's one of the best dark comedies of all time
0	bidi bidi we have trouble Buck I gave this a 2 star review not because I don't like the series but the way the disks were processed. DVD-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most. I have purchased other universal shows which had less problems. Airwolf, The A Team, ect. The only saving grace is I have a number of dvd players so I have managed to salvage all or most of the BR episodes. Why put all of the episodes on 5 disks? To save money but they charge big bucks for the sets
0	What in the world... Alright, the film has gorgeous landscapes, beautiful costumes and quite talented actors. However, if the director believed that incorporating pornography in the film would make up for its lack of historical accuracy, she was sadly mistaken. First of all, Artemisia "was" raped by Agostino Tassi--although she did not bring up a case against him as soon as it happened--and she never fell in love with him. Agostino Tassi, likewise, was never the loving and caring person portrayed in this film but an opportunistic man who believed himself to be superior to all other artists of his time, and the reason he raped Artemisia was that a virtuous girl would "pay" a lot of money amongst friends, and the one who rid the girl of her virginity would win and ensure that the girl didn't find a suitable husband. Yes, Artemisia did go to trial, and yes she was tortured, but all the while for her case against Agostino Tassi. She accused him of rape--even though her father did not support her--and won her case after being tortured and ridiculed for being a "female painter". I was extremely disappointed in the film and I'm sure that art historians will find it as ridiculous and faulty
0	The Rock and Vaughn stole the show Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie. Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it. As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad. How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me. She is not attractive nor can she act. She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit. I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better. His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak. And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so. The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn. Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie. I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping. While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again. Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.
1	43 years in healthcare............. ..........so I do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena. I have watched them all, Marcus Welby right on through ER. Scrubs is the most realistic, albiet tongue-in-cheek representation of our professions. You cannot take everything seriously, but, if you believe an emergency room can function like ER 24/7 and still have people standing, you're out of touch w/ reality as well
1	Love Comes Softly Loved the movie but I thought I was buying both of the movies in DVD and this one came in VHS. The sequel to LCSoftly came in DVD form but I was disappointed that LCS did not
1	Worth one's time The personality of the main character, Dr. House, is a breather from having to be PC all the time and it based on the notion of being brutally honest. That the main character does not make allowances for diplomacy is based on the notion that he has no time for stupidity. Therefore some people find House tiring and overly caustic, but it makes for great entertainment. The medical info is always challenging and I enjoy googling it afterwards. The series is one of the more intelligent ones on TV and one can actually learn from it
1	"I know that you cannot live on hope alone." Harvey Milk was the elected supervisor of District 6 in San Francisco when he was murdered--along with Mayor George Moscone on November 27, 1978, by fellow supervisor, Dan White (who later claimed the infamous "Twinkie defense"). The film "The Times of Harvey Milk" firmly places the murder of Milk, a gay politician, into the politically significant context of the times. The crime, the verdict, and the sentence served were all shocking. This film tells the story behind the headlines. Milk was a stockbroker on the East Coast, when he decided to pull up roots and head for San Francisco. He opened a camera shop on Castro Street and quickly earned the name of "Mayor of Castro Street" for his enthusiastic community involvement. His interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office, but when the city's elections ran by district--rather than citywide--Milk became the newly elected supervisor for the Sixth District. Milk's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall. The film includes photographs, newsreel footage, and many interviews with those who crossed Milk's path in a professional or personal capacity. Milk was passionate about public transportation, rent control, and the rights of seniors and gays. White, on the other hand, found San Francisco's Gay Day "obscene." Eerily, there are several photos of Milk that also include his killer--clean cut, ex-fireman and family man, Supervisor Dan White. The film explores the flavour of the times--San Francisco was becoming a gay Mecca, and there were some people who couldn't adjust to that fact. Senator John Briggs, who called San Francisco "the moral garbage dump of the nation" was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired. Milk fought this ballot tooth and nail, and it failed. The film "The Times of Harvey Milk" includes two discs. One disc contains the film, and the other disc is packed with extra features--including coverage of the film's premiere in Castro Street, a Dan White update, 1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime, director's commentary, the Academy Awards 1985, and a photo gallery. For those of us who remember the headlines, "The Times of Harvey Milk" is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time--displacedhuma
1	Fabulous Broadway Nostalgia I was at the '71 Tony Awards, broadcast in March of 1971, and I thought the marvelous night would have to live on in my memory. And, then, lo and behold...we get this marvelous record of theater history. Many of the performances were from the '71 broadcast..Zero Mostel, John Raitt, Robert Preston, Carol Channing, which was the Silver Anniversary of the Tony's, full of legendary performances from the history of the musical theater. I'm so looking forward to the other DVD's of performances that were not included. If you want to see the legends of Broadway perform their signature songs, then this is the tape for you
1	The Real Evil Dead No other movie has ever become such a booming sense of reality to my life than the evil dead movie/s.. Bruce Campbell is one if not my favourite actor and enjoy all his movies.. This edition is great for the commentaries on it and the extra features including Bruce's little doco on fans... a must have for all fans!!!! I am scared they are thinking of remaking this fantastic movie and I just hope Mr. Rami will realize this is a mistake... 'ASH' Rules!!
1	Not as good as part 2 but still great What can you say. This film really enthused a new generation of B-movie filmmakers. It's part of my generation and means as much to me as citizen cane meant to you know.....old people
0	Dated Home Movie I predicted in 1994 that this cinematic flash-in-the-pan wouldn't stand the test of time. It was all the rage in 1994 and I still can't honestly tell why. With its painful --- and I mean painful --- bad acting and its relentless attempts to be hip and trendy, it seems to be little more than someone's "artsy" home movie. I agree with the reviewer who finds it depressing to see lesbians frequently portrayed as unattractive, self-obsessed, women-children.... That was big in the 1990s but I think it's changing. (In fairness to the film, I can also appreciate that GO FISH was attempting to portray a segment of society not air-brushed and blown dry.) What makes this film ultimately fail, in my opinion, (aside from the acting) is that its story takes place in the vacuum of the 1990s young, urban lesbian ghetto. Almost all of the characters' issues, views and attitudes too narrowly reflect this tiny, specific demographic. There are a few crossover fans out there, but I can't imagine too many Midwestern, middle-aged and/or rural lesbians will find much to which they can relate. As a lesbian friend of mine said at the time this film came out: "Why would I want to go see some grainy, black & white film about a bunch of lesbians whose lives don't remotely resemble my own?" The normal answer to that question, of course, is: because it's an interesting story with compelling characters. However, in the case of GO FISH, neither applies. There's not much of a story and frankly, you could probably get your junior-high school niece and her friends to do a better job acting it. Watching this film is like seeing someone's 10 year-old home movies --- bad cinema, bad entertainment.
1	The drama of war is played out by the young.. This is my favourite movie, and the cinematography and music are amazing. In addition the various themes of belonging, loss, betrayal, and love, there is the fact that all these characters caught up in the war are so young. The disfigured Caravaggio, the naive and delightful Hana, the Sikh who defuses bombs... they are all young people who are still adjusting to the fact that life doesn't always give you what you want - less so during times of war. We even see how young the English Patient is during flashbacks, though he looks older and seems wiser since his experiences of physical and emotional loss. He knows he's dying, but everyone around him is also aware that they too, could die at any time; that's not something that young people usually think about on a regular basis. It is a beautiful film. It is also a deep film that reveals how different people respond to the fact that they could die any day
0	Even more stupid acting and writing.... a second season of even more bad writing, cliches all over the place, Bell can not act, and Silver is a joke of a Tv and film producer. Just another example of bad marketing and the TV add guys having too much say in how a show is done
0	EDITED! Don't buy this edition... if you wanted the whole film. Elizabeth McGovern's (who was Oscar nominated for this) scenes were cut from this edition, in order, I imagine, for it to have a PG rating. Buy an older VHS for the original film
1	Throne of Blood.... I was enormously fascinated by the film "The Throne of Blood" we just watched as part of our pre-AP English course in Nagoya International School, Japan. The film adopts the plot of Shakespeare's Macbeth with a Japanese setting. Macbeth is characterized as a Japanese warrior, the head of the 1st fort. After the victory, he sees a spirit (the witch-equivalent) in the forest on his way to the shogun's castle. As he has predicted, he was awarded the prestigious status of the head of the castle. The king decided to visit his castle one day to organize a plan to kill the Banquo-equivalent character. He is extremely proud of the trust that the king has in order to arrange such an important event, but his wife believes that the king insists on killing him instead. The big gap between his optimism and his wife's pessimism leads him to the road of Tragedy. I believe the director of the film could easily adopt the setting very similar to that of the original Macbeth, thanks to the similarities in the feudal system of Japan and Scotland. Japan also believed in the existence of spirits and how the nobleman was ranked in status was similar to that of Scotland. Kurosawa would've struggled creating The Throne of Blood if he, for example, adopted dynastic China or the Kingdom of Thailand as the scene instead of Japan. All of the characters in "The Throne of Blood" successfully and accurately emulated the characters in the Shakespearean version. Although there were some changes in their persona (such as the Lady Macbeth character was a more modest figure than the original), all characters kept their qualities, tendencies and their role. To people whom read Macbeth in the past, this movie is definitely worth the watch. Viewers can receive the same impression and the excitement of Macbeth with a totally different setting. Koy
0	so many gaps in the story This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story
0	big letdown. Where's the screenplay to this? Dad goes over some pretty annoying eye candy of giants midgets and a huge fish without any real alligorical content and that about it folks, trashy staff. The big promise of some sort of father son relationship forming is again apparently absent. Thumbs down of jessica lange, a great actress I ve see on stage a couple of times who goes completely wasted here (i don't think she mutters anything in excess of a couple of lines frankly) as a cartoon wife character. Tim's aiming to be the next ed wood possibly with this one, but, and I never thought I d say this, ed wood at least had some workable screenplay. Just plain trash
0	Why are there so many reviews of a product not even released yet? Zero stars, for a product not yet out. (5 for a great series though)While a few of the initial reviews, or should I say PREviews listing episodes, are informative, none of these writings here really do me, or most consumers any good, SINCE THIS ITEM HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED! Amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing, drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality, the ACTUAL episodes released, packaging, possible defects (like the Magnum series & Maiden's last Live DVD, both featured defective sections...) when the product IS released, I will have to wade through 7 (as of Oct 3) B.S. PRE-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying... These PRE'S, are presented by: fans? Industry Sales schmucks? Amazon employees? Who knows, pre-buyer beware...
0	Conservative, silly, embarrassing and 'dumbed-down' I saw this atrocity at an I-max cinema. I wish I hadn't. The whole thing is something of a travesty of the original Fantasia. The musical selection is humdrum and conservative - compared to the original. The imagery and animation is pleasant but unexciting. The guest spots are embarrassing and twee. If you have an interest in seeing something special done with music and images, check out Christine Schï¿½fer's "One Night. One Life" or Christian Chaudet's DVD of Stravinsky's "Le Rossignol". Don't bother with this atrocious Neo-Con / Religious Right world vision. In the original we had Stravinsky at his wildest and dinosaurs and in this we have Noah's friggin' Ark and Elgar at his most stodgy and conservative. There is an almost tangible pusillanimousness about this Fantasia 2000 "thing" which I found most distasteful. Let us hope that this idea stops with this one - or maybe they should hand the whole thing over to someone else to do? Maybe Miyazaki? Or some European directors? Fantasia 2000 isn't fantastic or much of a fantasy, to tell the truth.
0	Rosemary's Baby...in SPAAAAAAACE! Johnny Depp is my wife's favorite actor, so she bought The Astronaut's Wife from a bargain DVD bin when she saw his face on the cover. The plot's a little garbled, but it goes something like this: Capt. Alex Streck (Nick Cassavettes) and Commander Spence Armacost (Johnny Depp) go off on a space mission. When they come back, they're different. Some kind of weird sound--it sounds like shrieking static--was beamed into their bodies. What it is, exactly, we're not sure. Let's call it "a possessing entity." This malevolent entity wants to have children. Twins, to be precise. So Spence becomes fixated on 1) molesting his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron), and 2) building a spacecraft for two pilots. And then Jillian finds out she's pregnant! And soon, Streck dies of a seizure and his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide with a toaster! And it turns out she was pregnant...WITH TWINS! Scary stuff, right? Well, no. It's not scary. In fact, the film lingers and drags. Struggling to inject some urgency is the frenetic Sherman Reese (Joe Morton). Sherman is convinced something is wrong. He goes about it all the wrong way, of course, babbling on about aliens from outer space, harassing poor Jillian, and basically ensuring that he's a one note character, not an actually developed person. This movie is a blatant rip-off (or homage, if you think it's good) of Rosemary's Baby. This explains Theron's pageboy haircut, but doesn't excuse anything else. The battle of wills between husband and wife is really a battle of viewer's patience. Will she escape her husband? Will Jillian abort the children? Does anyone care? It's hard to care. For much of the film, we're not entirely convinced that there's anything actually wrong with Spence. He seems genuinely concerned with his wife; if the movie had bothered to keep us guessing, this would have made for an interesting twist (maybe she WAS crazy all along!). But it devolves pretty quickly. There's lots of sexual symbolism, and not the good kind. Yes folks, this is the first film I've ever seen that seriously showed a subway train entering a tunnel overlapped with Depp's "Oh" face (fans of Office Space will know what I mean). Is that symbolism or what? Finally, Depp has affected a southern accent for no discernable reason. It turns into something of a vague mumble and he shifts in and out of it (especially when angry), such that we're not sure if Spence really ever had an accent. Wouldn't it have been cool if the accent disappeared when the alien possessed him? Yeah, that would have been neat movie. Rosemary's Baby was very much a product of its time. The Astronaut's Wife has all the pretty people and slick special effects, but never really bothers to reinforce the sinister nature of the people from beyond. EVERYONE gets that the Devil is evil incarnate and that you don't want to have his baby. The Astronaut's Wife never actually proves that the aliens are bad...Jillian's twins could go on to create world peace for all we know. Fortunately, Depp and Theron would go on to do much better works. Alas, the Astronaut's Wife serves as a reminder that you can't just swap out religion with aliens and assume it will be a great movie
0	Fairy tale Mob I have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it wasn't the same movie I have. This movie in no way represents the life of La Cosa Nostra. There are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic. It's present day and the guys are &quot;running numbers&quot;. Hello, ever hear of the Lottery. They start up a &quot;bookie buisness&quot;. Besides calling it a bookie buisness, which is just plain retarded, how are 4 nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster. Then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him. I guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over. Then again that might have been a good thing. The acting was terrible except for the late Ray Serra and Joe D'Onofrio. Even Joe Viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed Tons of work. Rent the HBO film Gotti if you want to see what it's really like. Just to include Wannabees and William DeMao in the same breath as Goodfellas and the great living legend Robert DeNiro is an insult. Now DeMao is making &quot;Searching for Bobby DeNiro&quot;, he could only wish. The only reason I gave it a star is because I had to, they dont let you give it none
0	a lot of effort, little substance. There's not too much I can offer here, since I found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie. A lot of nice shots of the robots in this, and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings. I'm sure there has been some debate over the use of Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie, but that's not something that I think really applies to my overall sense of the film. I am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema. A lot of the camera angles, costumes, the shapes of the robots and weapons, all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore, and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction, as silly as they may look to us today. But this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane. There are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future, and because of that they're not often harked upon. Instead, this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments, a spiffy sidekick, and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating. This movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance.
0	High expectations that were not met I could not wait to see this movie when I first saw the coming attractions. I can honestly say that I wasn't totally disappointed but my life isn't any better now that I have seen it. Only a few laughs here and not many memorable scenes. Get it if you must but I would not waste too much money for it
0	The Break Up is One Irritating Film The Break Up is a an annoying film that presents a couple on the brink of all- out personal warfare over a relationship gone bad. This movie features plenty of yelling, deceitfulness, game playing, and other things that are common when a relationship has reached its final hours. I can remember when this film was first released and it seemed intriguing. Based on the advertisements for the film, it looked like it would be an entertaining romantic comedy. It fact, it is neither romantic nor funny. There are dashes of humor at the beginning of the film but little else. The movie is mostly serious all the way with Vaughn and Aniston arguing almost non- stop until the very end of the film when they become civil once more. Vaughn and Aniston were known to be personally involved with each other during the time this movie was being filmed and this fact gave me the impression that the movie would offer great chemistry and passion. But Vaughn and Aniston do not seem right in this movie. They don't seem like a likely couple and many film critics have correctly pointed out that the two were not very good together in this film. What really bothered me most with this movie is how irritated I felt as I watched! Vaughn and Aniston continuously trade barbs with each other and Vaughn acts impatient and irritating even when he is with friends. Watching the film actually elevated my blood pressure and raised my stress level. I watched it with the hope of viewing a lightened up comedy that would serve as a good after- work stress reliever. Instead, I felt the urge to blow off steam when the movie was finally over. This drama might be the type that some bickering couples can relate to but not only could I not relate, my tolerance for this film continued to decline with each minute. I just wanted it to end to put me out of my misery. There are a few redeeming qualities with this movie, like the individual performances by the various cast members. But the main problem with the acting is that the performers and performances don't seem to gel. The characters are fine on their own, but they don't have the on- screen chemistry so desperately needed to make this film work. It all ads up to a frustrating film that should be avoided.
0	Is ''cringe-worthy'' a word? I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character. Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie. This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch
0	hmm This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO
1	A marvelous blend of the "old" and the "new" Besides painting a satisfying portrait of "upwardly mobile profesional black Americans," "Boomerang" is an appealing look at the oft-times amusing and tumultuous struggle between the sexes. Eddie Murphy, who served as producer, is wonderful as the "player" who gets his comeupance from a female equal, in the well-proportioned form of Robin Givens. A stellar cast that features legends Eartha Kitt and Geoffrey Holder, then up-and-comers Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and a pre-Oscar Halle Berry, established performers like Lela Rochon, Tisha Campbell, and David Allen Grier, and an over-the-top Grace Jones makes this a classic in the truest sense of the term. Watch the film with director Reginald Hudlin's commentary. He provides colorful insight into the pivotal use of New York locations, costuming, casting concerns, the importance of background music, film economics, and unintentional social commentary. Many times the director's "chat" is dull; that cannot be said for the words of this talented young man. "Boomerang," like the word implies, is a film that warrants "return" visits.
1	Better Than ANY Tarantino Film, Period. That is coming from someone who love anything this director makes, presents, or endorses. I think this is a very complex and satisfying film. Using the relatively unfilmed cities of LA, such as Hawthorne, Compton, the REAL Hollywood, it utilizes a more down to earth approach to real world crime. This isn't about a multimillion dollar heist, and the criminals are likeable and genuinely interesting even if one or two are full of themselves (Namely Ordell and Melanie.) The film opens with the classic Across 110th Street as sung by Bobby Womack and featuring a strong Pam Grier, walking that moving sidewalk at LAX. As the opening progresses she ends up possessing a look of worry on her face that shows a VERY strong woman's strength become vulnerablity. From then on we meet a handful of excentric baddies and law enforcers, that are all likeable, interesting and have at least one or two funny lines (with the exception of the cop who isn't Michael Keaton, who is just a plain jackass cowboy cop) My favorite part is the friendship/romance between Pam and the subtle and sensational Robert Forster. Starting with a very special ride home, which bleeds to a bar, and then to Griers Apartment. All involve rich dialogue and interest shown. They bond thru body language, their age, and eventually music("The Del----Fonics".) The fact that Forster rushes to the nearest record store for his first Delfonics Tape is just plain cute, and shows he is falling for her music and all. The Scenes between Grier and Sam Jackson also need recognition. They are at times funny, terrifying, and very well acted. There is also Robert DiNiro as an old friend/partner to Jackson, and a few girlfriends of ordell's such as Surfer Girl/PotHead Melanie, Old sex siren Simone, and Super Slow Country Girl Sheronda. There is just a bunch of rich characters here, and they all give great parts no matter how big or how small...especially Chris Tucker, who's performance as a snitch is equal parts brilliant and hilarious. This movie just hits a right note for anyone interested in a talky, rich picture. Tarantino says this is a movie for older people, well at 19, I'm definitely not younger, but this is my favorite of all tarantino films, be it because of the great soundtrack, storyline, performances, direction it makes no difference. It's my favorite period. Give it a chance and you'll see what I see...Great Movie
1	Ginger Rogers Excels In Romantic Wartime Christmas Story "I'll Be Seeing You", is a wonderful companion piece to that other moving wartime story produced by David O. Selznick in 1944, "Since You Went Away", and it provided Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton with one of their best vehicles during the mid 1940's. Dismissed nowadays as a sugar coated romance that piles on the sentiment I dont see that as a failing at all and instead it provides a touching human story about two injured individuals finding love at an unexpected time in their lives when things are not going well. Selznick of course will be forever remembered and revered for producing grandiose stories such as "Gone With The Wind", however his abilities with smaller scale human dramas about seemingly ordinary people in ordinary situations have I feel never been given enough recognition. "I'll Be Seeing You", which was based on Charles Martin's radio play "Double Furlough", truly proves my point that his way of approaching smaller scale story telling was just as memorable. Here Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton play two very average and identifiable people, one a victim of the world war currently engulfing the world, and the second an unfortunate victim of one action that had serious consequences, situations any individual could find themselves in. What a joy it was to discover that this beautiful little film has finally been made available via DVD after being so hard to track down for so long. Set during World War Two "I'll Be Seeing You", has Ginger Rogers as Mary Marshall a lonely woman who is half way through a prison sentence for a charge of accidental manslaughter who because of her good behaviour is given an eight day leave pass over the Christmas period. Travelling to visit her relations on the train she meets Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotton), and the two strike up a friendship. Zachary has only recently been released from the hospitial as he has been suffering from shell shock and war injuries and the plan is to see if he can speed his recovery by getting out into the world. He implusively follows Mary to her stop and pretends that he is visiting his sister in the same town of Pine Hill. Mary arranges for Zachary to visit her at the home of her aunt and uncle (Tom Tully and Spring Byington), and the pair spend much time together and very quickly fall in love. Romance develops for the two as they spend Christmas Day together and then both attend the YMCA dance on New Years Eve. Both however have the dilemma of having to tell the other of their problems and with Mary having to report back to prison at the end of the holidays time begins to run out. One their last day in Pine Hill Mary's younger cousin Barbara (Shirley Temple), unintentionally discloses to Zachary about Mary's real situation and in his initial shock and anger he tries to get away from Mary as quickly as possible. He boards the train without really saying goodbye to her and Mary faces the lonely prospect of life back in prison with no one waiting for her. Bidding her family a sad goodbye Mary prepares to continue with her sentence but just as she arrives at the prison gates fate takes a pleasant turn for her for once when she is greeted by a remorseful Zachary who reaffirms his deep love for her. Zachary states firmly that he truly loves her and that whatever it takes they will be together and that he will wait until she is released from prison so that they can be married. A touching love story set at Christmas is of course a natural for romantic movie lovers however this effort is much more than just that. Fine story telling combines here with well thought out performances by the cast to create a story that leaves you with something to think about in regard to our needs as individuals. Ginger Rogers especially as the woman out on Christmas leave from prison proves once and for all what a fine dramatic actress she truly was among all her other screen talents. She also has a believable and at times quite poignant screen chemistry with Joseph Cotton as the mentally scarred Sargeant just out of hospital that makes us care about these two essentially lonely and hurt individuals. Long wanting to be recognised for more than just being Fred Astaire's dance partner, here Rogers proves that with a well thought out and modulated performance that shows beautifully all her characters insecurities and fears when she finds herself falling in love with Cotton's character. Joseph Cotton, a Selznick contractee delivers another interesting performance here and makes his Zachary Morgan a very human individual fighting a terrible affliction and then having to learn to deal with his unexpected love for Mary. Supporting performances are first rate all around. A teenage Shirley Temple fresh from her triumph in Selznick's classic "Since You Went Away", delivers another fine performance here full of teenage spunk and vivacity and I always think it a tragedy that her later teenage roles for the most part never matched the quality of her work in productions like 'Since You Went Away", and "I'll Be Seeing You". Spring Byington who had already worked with Ginger Rogers in the delightful comedy romance "Lucky Partners", in 1940 again combines well with her here as her Aunt and despite the two having very different acting styles and screen personas they have a wonderfully relaxed rapport on screen together. "I'll Be Seeing You", had the usual meticulous attention to detail recreating in the studio exactly what was still happening in the world at that time (1944-45). Like in all war times there is always humour in among the sorrow and this production provides just that, for example in the dress shop scene,and at the YMCA New Years Eve Ball, and these are randomly situated between the more serious goings on throughout the film's running time. Of course the drama here is what makes "I'll Be Seeing You", such a standout and is vividly represented in scenes such as Mary's terrible recollection to Barbara of the incident that put her in jail, through to Zachary's ongoing efforts to curb his mental sufferings resulting from his active duties. Director William Dieterle keeps the pace of the story moving and we see a growing inner confidence developing in both Mary and Zachary that sees them overcome their fears and lack of trust in others to follow their hearts in their feelings for each other. Tender romances about ordinary people who are not perfect are seldom seen nowadays but the strength of "I'll Be Seeing You", rests in its ability to make two such ordinary people infinitely interesting and people who we care about. I've always enjoyed the great talents of both Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton and the two make most believable lovers here. The charming Christmas setting taking place during the dark war years is guarenteed to tug at the heart strings of any romantic movie lover and it never fails to move me with its simple message of love and respect for others no matter what their affliction or failings are. Take a romantic journey back soon to a simple war time Hollywood love story to see how effectively it could be portrayed on screen in Selznick Productions, "I'll Be Seeing You" .
0	gobbledygook & self-righteousness & pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek
0	Boring This movie was so boring and slow moving that we turned it off after 45 minutes. Not recommended as it was too boring
0	How to make a bad dvd of a good concert AOL music allows you to download the entire concert for free, which is FAR better than this dvd. This is NOT a dvd of the Las Vegas concert; it is a dozen music videos, all of which were created from the concert footage. The director has chopped-and-diced this concert beyond enjoyment. The sound is not in true surround sound, and the MTV-style quick-cuts and wacky angles are so annoying as to make the video unwatchable.
0	the producers were drunk when they made this movie Most off the scientific facts are wrong. The earth's center is as big as Mars!!!!!! Come on!!!!!! Maybe as big as Moon. Under the Earth's ground is liquid magma. Its liquid because off the pressure, and its not possible to under it. The Producers obviously forget about food supplies, and oxygen. The only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air. I think that this is the only realistic thing
1	Favorite Workout I have to say this is my favorite of all of Leslie's workouts. Yes, I agree with the other person who said that Mary Kay is annoying, however, I feel the best when I am done with this video. I like the variety of it all
0	poor transfer,paging criterion Since we know there is another version of "Burn" out there,i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.You can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan,poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.Brando told larry king it was his favorite film;not if he saw this package
0	The cell phone is the main character The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it? After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day? Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it
0	Syri-Sucka... This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage
1	Old-Fashioned Sci-Fi Movie At Its Best I sound like an old man when I say that there are movies back in the day that are better than the slickest modern production, even when the movies outdate ME. Maybe because today's filmmakers are so much in love with CGI effects that they feel they can replace little, unimportant things like plot, storyline and character development. That's why I've steadfastly refused to see Spielberg's version of this classic; I don't want anything to tarnish my memory of what I consider, as a kid growing up and today, one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Folks hold up "Forbidden Planet" as the quintiscencial science fiction film of all time, and while I'd never quibble with other people's opinion, I believe this movie gives that one a serious run for its money. First of all, for its relatively short running time, we are given everything that I mentioned earlier, and it doesn't feel rushed. Purists complain that there were too many changes to the source material, but period films are period films, at least according to the thought of that time, and sci-fi is sci-fi. To stage a '50s film adaptation of H.G. Wells ACTUALLY IN Victorian England would've been a bit much for the audience seeing it in a cinema. The changes, once you get settled into the story, are really minor, and actually help add to the enjoyment of the movie. And they do add breadth to "War Of The Worlds," for we see glimpses of how the rest of the world is faring with the Martian Invasion. Other countries get their collective butts kicked, and we see it happen live. We see the failure of a purely military solution to a lifeform that has superior technology and not the least bit of concern for the other beings already on their new home. Is it a metaphor for the "Red Menace" mentality of the time? A little bit, but there's also a hint that, for all the power the U.S. Armed Forces has, simple military solutions aren't going to cut it. In its way, this movie is more progressive in "political" tone than others of its time or type. Finally, we have the special effects, which actually hold up well to the effects of today. Yep, digital transfers, done well, allow us to see the wires and supports holding up spaceships, and somehow that alien arm just seems....cheezy, when compared to what's possible with today's techniques and budgets, but they knew how to use what they had. More importantly, they knew what to show and what not to show. The aliens themselves were troublesome and balky, not to mention they had the habit of falling apart when moved too much, so we were left with mostly our imagination as the filmmakers used shadow, music, and brief glimpses of the Martians' technology, bodies, and hands to create the horror they wanted us to feel. Their techniques worked then, and they still work today. So, what can be said of a movie that's really "timeless?" Compare some of Hollywood's most lavish productions in recent years to a movie made when special effects REALLY had to be slaved over, and "War Of The Worlds" tops out every single time
0	Wonderful film but poor DVD quality I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe". The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [...
1	The Perfect Storm It's freakin" awesome. It was perfect from the start all the way to the end. I was just amazedddd by how it was able to keep me on the edge of the chair the whole time. Just amazing. and I highly recommend you to watch this movie
0	Dust Off Your Bong For This One! Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!
1	Footloosin' good time! I don't think that in real life a pastor can actually outlaw dancing in a town but it makes a decent story. Great highlights in the film are when Kevin Bacon taught Chris Penn's character how to dance(lets hear it for the boy!), the fight scene when Bacon and Penn beat up the corny tough guys,and of course the great dancing during the prom which closed the film
1	Nice for an out of shape ex-dancer I had quite a bit of dance training as a child and teen, but haven't really danced for 20 years. Also, I'm a complete beginner at hip-hop, but wanted to learn a little just for fun. And it's not like I can't walk around the block, but I'd say I'm a low level of cardio fitness. So this video is absolutely perfect for me right now. I did have to rewind a couple times on my first viewing, and I didn't quite get all the arm and head moves down the first time. But I'm sure in a few sessions I'll be doing the moves with some attitude. It's probably going to get a little boring after a while, but I'll try and extend the fun period by mixing it up with other videos and activities. At some point it is probably going to get too easy to be a good workout, but that will be a while. She doesn't really break down the individual motions for you technique-wise, but they are pretty easy to pick up on. The instructor is a lot of fun, too. The only way this could be better is if there were several different workouts on the disc, or maybe options to extend the combination longer. You're not getting a ton of content for your money. But I'm happy with the purchase -- because I just wanted something not too intense and fun, for rainy days and to mix up my workout. One more thing - I consider some of the stretches questionable and dicey at best. I would never, for instance, use my hand to pull my neck into a stretch like she shows. Be careful with these and modify them if you need to. I substitute different stretches as needed
0	I secede "Philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up, 'What's that?'" - Ludwig Wittgenstein Imagine spending an hour and a half with a teenage version of The Sphynx from "Mystery Men," but without Mr. Furious as a foil. Instead, there's the somewhat compassionate, somewhat opportunistic Pearl Madison, played by Don Cheadle. Sometimes I wasn't sure if Cheadle was doing a really good job playing someone who is conflicted, or if his regret for signing up for this film was bleeding through on screen. The film is similar to "Mystery Men" in a way, though; the filmmakers assembled a talented production crew, and a cast of some of my favorite actors (including Kevin Spacey -- also one of the film's prodcuers) and put them in one of the most frustrating films I've ever sat through. I guess I'm just really tired of small movies about suburban life with fey, disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms and non sequitors. I wouldn't mind so much if the film was able to deliver some sort of epiphany, but it doesn't. When the credits rolled, the only thing I was thinking about was a guy who'd stabbed his girlfriend's retarded brother, and writer/director Matthew Hoge asking, "What's that?" I may as well have watched "Elephant" again. If exploring suburban angst is your thing, you might like this film. There are better cooked stories out there, though. I watched Larry Clark's "Ken Park" afterward, which was like "The United States of Leland" in a less wealthy neighborhood. Both films were depressing, but I felt so gross after I watched "Ken Park" I promptly returned it to the video store, showered and cleaned my whole apartment. At least I was shocked into action. "The United States of Leland" just had me crawling back into bed. The soundtrack is okay. The score is by Sunny Day Real Estate's Jeremy Enigk. Jena Malone shoots up heroin to the Pixies, and there's a Dot Allison song I like in the credits that I'd forgotten about. No CD was released.
1	Can't wait for the next release! I grew up watching this and just love watching the show now as an adult! I really love that these came out on DVD and wonder when season 4 is coming out? Hurry! :) It's nice to have a show that's clean, interesting, has intelligent characters, and entertaining at the same time! Woo hoo
1	Murder, She Wrote: Season Three It took me only two weeks to watch all 22 episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" - The Complete Third Season. And my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two: just more mystery fun with Angela Lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver Jessica Fletcher. Familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three, including recent "Syriana" Oscar winner George Clooney, past Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine ("The Poseidon Adventure") and Martin Balsam ("Psycho"), "Friends" alum Courtney Cox Arquette, "Brady Bunch" veterans Florence Henderson and Barry Williams, veteran comic Buddy Hackett, and "Naked Gun" star Leslie Nielsen. Other guest stars include: Gloria Stuart ("Titanic"), G.W. Bailey ("Police Academy"), Tess Harper ("Tender Mercies"), Jessica Walter ("Arrested Development"), Hayley Mills ("The Parent Trap"), Bill Macy ("Maude"), Genie Francis ("General Hospital"), Dinah Manoff ("Empty Nest"), and Harry Morgan ("M*A*S*H"). Three stars from the "Star Trek" TV shows turned up for guest appearences: George Takei (the original "Star Trek" series), LeVar Burton ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), and Kate Mulgrew ("Star Trek: Voyager"). Erin Moran, best known for playing Joannie on the popular '70s sitcom "Happy Days", guest starred in the third episode of season three titled "Unfinished Business", which reunited her with "Happy Days" co-star Tom Bosley, who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of "Murder, She Wrote" as Amos Tupper, the sheriff of Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine (I've very much enjoyed Bosley's appearences on "Murder, She Wrote" as well as William Windom's reoccuring appearences as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt). And in an interesting scenario, Tom Selleck and John Hillerman turn up in their "Magnum P.I." roles as part of a cross-over episode, with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of "Magnum P.I." (which was in its seventh season) and concluding with an episode of "Murder, She Wrote" (episode #8 to be exact). That episode of "Magnum P.I." is featured as a bonus on season three of "Murder, She Wrote". The "Magnum P.I."/"Murder, She Wrote" cross-over episodes (titled "Novel Connection" and "Magnum on Ice") were a favorite of mine. Other great episodes from season three include: "Death Stalks the Big Top" parts 1 and 2, "Unfinished Business", "Obituary For A Dead Anchor", "The Corpse Flew First Class", "Crossed Up", "Simon Says, Color Me Dead", "No Laughing Murder", "No Accounting For Murder", and "Murder, She Spoke". "Murder, She Wrote" season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime, and Lansbury is wonderful as usual. I'm sure the fun will continue with season four!
0	Lousy movie I saw the stage production and thought that since it was good the movie would be good also. I was very wrong. The movie is awfu
0	Pedigree vs. Filigree. Filigree wins. Period dramas are, by definition, delicate commodities: they're balanced on that, ahem, "razor's edge" between high brow and just plain fussiness. I think "Howard's End" is a case of a robust novel buried in tea time and English lace. Milliners, set designers and Helena Bonham Carter's hair stylist had their job cut out for them on this one
0	Good intentions but... A prestigious scientist (Scharwzenegger) is embraced by artificial insemination testing by himself a new pharmacological device. In spite of the existence of several funny humor blows, it predominates along the picture coarse humor, signed by a permissive and excessively didactic vision of the sex. To be true, there is a potent allegation respect the familiar institution and the motherhood virtue. The fact is that a good chance was wasted about regain the magic of those classic comedies directed by Wilder or Hawks. But anyway, let' s make an imagination exercise; Mel Brooks directing, with a six hands script written by Robin Williams, Billy Cristal and Danny de Vito would have been a major successful premise. But all comparisons sound hateful, perhaps. Don `t you?
1	Verry Funny Their research threatened when they fail to nab a grant, two fertility doctors, Alex Hesse (Arnold Schwarzenneger) and Larry Arbogast (Danny DeVito), test their theory and implant Hesse with an embryo. They'd initially planned to terminate the pregnancy after the first 3 months, but Mr. Mom-to-be soon decides to go the whole 9 months ... morning sickness, stretch marks and all. Plus, Hesse is smitten with a fellow scientist (Emma Thompson)
1	A poignant and captivating tale Beanie huge fan of all of the three main actors, this ensemble and the writers and directors will everyone who worked on the film made this film a must-see event. An incredible depiction placed in the Civil War this beautiful tale of love and war, friendship and agony, joy and loss captivate every one of your senses. The love story between Inman played by Jude Law and Ada played by Nicole Kidman is romantic, poetic and heart wrenching. Showing what happens to each character separately serves this movie well. The narration of the letterwriting brings you deeper into the story. The ending will surprise you
1	Exhilerating! I've been doing this workout for several months, and it's still challenging! But everytime I do it, I feel invigorated and strong! Basic kickboxing moves are repeated and built upon, and the instructors' explicit descriptions ensure that each move is done properly and effectively. And her accent is pretty cool! Legs/Butt, Arms/Shoulders, Cardio/Aerobics, and Abs are all covered... the perfect well-rounded workout! Highly recommneded!
1	Deeply Moving I recommend this anime to everyone (as long as you can handle scenes of violence directed at children). I'm not one of those emotional types of people, but Now and Then is so profound that it even moved me. The animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is the best I've ever heard (Note, my anime collection is small, so you may wish to take the last statement with a grain of salt). I was unsure when I purchased this, but after watching it, I am glad that I did. I do have some minor issues with the ending. At the end of each episode, which is how it is divided, is a preview of sorts for the next episode. To me, the preview before the final episode was a bit misleading. However, this issue is rather minute, and does not warrant a 4 star rating. Edit: It appears my DVD player skipped at least half of the final episode. Ignore the comments regarding the final episode
1	Classic This movie is a classic. If you haven't seen it or heard of it, buy it now
0	This is not Alexander Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him. We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his "true" character and nature is at best just hypothetcal conjecture. No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves. Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biograpies of Alexander. From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the more scholarly Robin Lane Fox's "Alexander the Great" there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have. Certainly the life of Alexander is a msystery since there is virtualy nothing know about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film. For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the "Battle of Chaeronea" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie. Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer. Obviously, his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but "give me a break". This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him "The Great". Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless. And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct. And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guess work at that. Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was intrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace. While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted. Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros. He was also allowed to refered to as a "man" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a "man". At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field. It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving. The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander. A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better. And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in "Road Runner" cartoons. One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie: On his march back "home", he encountered the "Mallians", a fierce and warring nation. An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving. Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up. Three othr men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him. The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements. The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but alexander jumped into the fort and attacked. He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians. The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there. That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psyhological meanderings that were a complete bore. Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military stratagey and tactics, a philosopher, muscian, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the "grand tradition". Maybe Peter Jackson should make a movie about Alexander. I'm sure he could get it "right".
1	A worthy addition to your fitness collection This DVD will get you sweating in a hurry. I really like the interval training in the Fat Eliminator segment. Alternating strength and cardio segments does make the workout go by quickly, which is a plus for this reluctant exerciser! Minna is excellent at cueing and I like her demeanor. The only thing I really don't like about it (and why it is not a 5-star video for me) is all of the jumping. It is definitely NOT low-impact. If you have knee problems, find another video!
0	I Don't Get It There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', however. I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas. Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything. This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there). It certainly couldn't be because it's funny. The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise. That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not. That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not. That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not. That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not. You get the drift. Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat. Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles. If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'. Watch a movie that doesn't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh. Sincerely, Bill Cosb
1	Great dvd collection It's excellent dvd series to add to your collection . Jimmy walker(JJ) & (Florida)Ester Rolle
1	Phenomenal The acting is superb and the dedication to recreating the era is phenomenal. I loved the music even more after I saw the 3rd "extras" DVD and found out about all what went into making it authentic. And, finally actors who look like the Jewish people of the times! Henry Ian Cusick is simply amazing and real and heartfelt as Jesus. I've never seen a better rendition. The main Pharisee was excellent as well. If you didn't know this movie was a word for word portrayal of the bible you wouldn't think anything was strange about it. It simply comes off as a world class major motion picture. And then after you do know, you are so glad that they did it that way. I do have to disagree with one point of a reviewer that it "made no apologies" in portraying that the Romans and the Jews put Jesus to death. I thought it was quite clear that God the Father sent Him to the cross and Jesus accepted that role. The Romans and the Jews were simply instruments of God and that comes across loud and clear. I can't recommend this movie enough. You will get a lot out of it each time you watch it and you will watch it over and over. The interviews on the "behind the scenes" with the scholars and actors, etc. was excellent. Make sure you get the 3 CD set to see all the extras
0	Where to begin? The numerous historical inaccurracies are already outlined in other reviews. Political correctness and post Cold War jingoism maquerading as hindsight are to blame for this farce of a war movie. Some of the historic elements (like Stalin's "not one step back" order, etc) are haphazardly crammed into a few opening scenes, creating an anachronistic mess. Unfortunately, there aren't many Soviet perspective films on Stalingrad to choose from. Would recommend this film to those looking for simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment with the novelty of a war movie that's not from the "usual" U.S. or German WWII perspective. Would not recommend it for anyone interested in historical accuracy or complex and original plotlines
0	Please let it be the Final Final Destination 3 is hopefully the final installment to this series. They have all been entertaining, gory, and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally. The acting has never been first rate, horror movies rarely offer Oscar worthy performances. The formula has always been followed, someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their "get out of death " free card to the grim reaper. The main characters must figure out the order of death, and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely. By this third movie, it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation. The tanning beds, the nail gun, the motor chopping off heads, and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius. The extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time, I don't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates (besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense) I have read other reviews on here, and I have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster shouldn't have showed their grim fates, if they all were supposed to die on the ride, Did death know she would save them? If so than that changes everything, its not really cheating death than is it? Oh well, anyway, watch this if you have some free time, and if you liked the first two, its an okay , hopefully the end to this played out series.

1	A REAL SPECIAL EDITION !!! How many times have you seen the "special edition" label in a DVD cover? Many times i`m sure, but that could mean anything. From new remastered picture and new digital audio to boring meanenless interviews, but what about REAL extras? Like deleted scenes, outtakes, i mean real material that realy interest the viewer, and in this cult film's case, THE FANS! Because this cult classic is a matter of real fanatism, we the fans demand all the spinal tap material that we can get hour hands on! And this special edition brings you all that and more. Not only typical extra written material, like filmographies and bios, here you can find all the audiovisuals that weren`t used, tv trailers, movie trailers, commercials, interviews, and enough deleted scenes and outtakes to make a whole new movie of its own! I mean everything! fake interviews, presentations on tv shows, video clips, goofing-around trailers, a crazy audio commentary by the "band" during the film, you name it... Even the main page is commented by spinal tap!!!! In conclusion, A REAL DEAL, don`t miss this edition. It`s not often to find a real cult classic movie in such a fine presentation loaded with such material. Amazing realy. Of course the digital and audio could have been better, but the movie is so entertainning that you can pass that
0	Really pretty dull for such a button-pushing topic I wasn't impressed by this film. First of all, I could never "buy" that Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen were a brother and sister. Nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related. Nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother-sister relationship. They might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems, because that's how the relationship came across. Personally, outside of the button-pushing topic of incest, I found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry. Clive Owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was simply annoying (like her character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man.) The only actors who showed any real feeling were Alan Rickman as the husband, and Karl Johnson as Clive Owen's AIDS-stricken boss. Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film: he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously suffering from AIDS, and this very fact intimidates the guy he's gone to meet. The man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the Karl Johnson character, and in the end Karl Johnson seizes the guy's sandwich and bites it, then offers the other guy a bite, pushing the sandwich into his face, basically...it's a scene that crackles with his anger & pain at being trapped by this illness, which is going to kill him, while this corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally. But aside from that wake-up call, the film dragged, and by the time Clive Owen's character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he's been used by his "sister" to inflate her sense of self-importance, I was long gone, with my head nodding. Much ado about nothing, frankly. One star for the soundtrack; one star for the performances of Alan Rickman (what little he has to work with, he shines) and Karl Johnson. Die-hard Clive Owen fans such as myself; eeeh, pass on this.
0	Wholesome, weird, and dull This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altuistic slant. It wasn't a "bad" movie it simply wasn't a "good" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzz
0	good intentions, plodding drama **1/2 If "North Country" didn't say that it was set in 1989, you'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters, which can only be classified as "Neanderthal" (though that might be an insult to Neanderthals). And, indeed, you would be right NOT to believe it, for the events on which the film is based actually began in 1975, a full decade and a half before the time of the movie. The drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the Clarence Thomas Senate hearings of 1991 - images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie. It's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that doesn't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie. With Charlize Theron once again ugly-ing herself up for great drama, "North Country" tells the true but highly fictionalized story of Lois Jensen (here referred to as Josie Aimes), a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern Minnesota steel mine, only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment. Here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make Henry Higgins look like Alan Alda in comparison. When she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there, Aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant, the unenlightened townsfolk, or even her own female co-workers who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs. Eventually, she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine (in 1988, actually, a full three years before the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill spectacle), resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country. There is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one, but "North Country" feels strangely out-of-date and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world (yes, I realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be, but that still doesn`t make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie). Moreover, "North Country" can't quite shake that air of stultifying self-importance that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues. As a result, the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme, with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero, villain and victim molds with very little shading in between. Despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story, the film is riddled with push button feel-good moments and implausible instant conversions - and damned if the whole thing doesn't have the look and feel of a Lifetime original movie, just with higher priced stars in its cast (Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sissy Spacek, and Richard Jenkins, the dead father from "Six Feet Under"). And while the acting is decent, the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters. Perhaps it's just that after movies like "Norma Rae," "Silkwood," and "Erin Brockovich," which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised, "North Country" comes up a day late and a dollar short in the I-am-woman-hear-me-roar department.
1	To the person who said this is not a classic........ Now, this movie may not have been known well when it came out in 1985, but, it's popularity grew as much as it has been shown on tv (Countless times). Now, let's say that John Hughes produced this film; I bet you that it would have been much better known if it had his name on it; Thus, at the time that this movie came out, John Hughes had some big hits under his belt (I.E. Sixteen Candles, & The Breakfast club to name a couple). If it had Molly Ringwald as the lead actress, then it would have been a bigger hit. Joyce Hyser, however, wasn't/ isn't a VERY well known (If known) actress. So, alot of people really didn't pay much attention to this movie. I mean, what really big hit movies or starring roles did Ms. Hyser have really? This and a few others were her ONLY starring roles. From what i've seen of her movies besides this one and another, she mostly had small parts. Like, Does anyone remember seeing Ms. Hyser in the 80's classic "Valley Girl"(Starring Nicholas Cage)? The ONLY scene she was in was at the prom at the end asking "Where are the cups?", and, that was it. True, this movie may not be "Fantastic", but, it was ALOT better then some of those cheesy 80's movies that came out around the same time. I personally think this movie was well-acted, and, cute for it's time. It's honestly underrated, but, by it showing on HBO, and, Comedy Central ALOT it's popularity grew. Hence, why they FINALLY released it on Dvd. It may not be a known "classic", like, "Pretty In Pink", "Sixteen Candles", "The Breakfast Club", and "St. Elmoes Fire", but, it's a classic in it's own right. I think if better known at the time, people wouldn't of slepted on this classic. Joyce hyser was wonderful in this role. And, I think it's honestly her best, and, I am glad it's finally being appreciated after 21 years! I am soo glad they talked about it on vh1's "I Love The 80's 3-D" last year.
1	Funny Actor is Funny Doctor Patch Admas is a real doctor who make people laugh. He use ballons, a pool with pasta and angel costum for dyingman. Is so funny! And Robin Williams is perfect actor for part. He look and act crazy like real doctor, but he also care and love people. He only wanna help. He even trust Larry, who is psyco and kill Patch girlfriend, but she become butterfly, so is ok. The top doctor in hosptal is like nazzi- very evil. He try to stop Patch, but Patch wins trial. He is call Patch because he fix old mans coffeecup. He become doctor because he long ago want to kill himself but in crazy house he helps his roommate fight fake sqirrles. And he like helping people so he is become doctor. In doctor school he want to meet patients and learn there names. He is a different kind doctor for sure! And so funny! He build special hospital for free
1	CSI is the show to watch! I was absolutely, hopelessly hooked on CSI from the first time I watched it. I started with Season 1 (never saw it on t.v., just started watching the DVDs) and am now on Season Three. This has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the CSIs is amazing, the story lines are fresh, and it has quickly become my favorite drama (with 24 being a VERY close second). Only one thing about the other reviews -- yes, Nick's character is gorgeous, but how about that Warrick? He's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous, but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face, body -- everything. Grissom is also attractive because he's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything. Sara has a great voice, and well I could say something great about all of the character's physical qualities, but the most important thing is that the show is captivating, innovative, and fresh. Season after season, you're drawn into each and every story line. I love CSI and hope it stays on the air for another 10 years
1	Ouitstanding Movie Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo
1	An Intruiging Plot, With A good Message Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, "ever since I saw Batman Begins" and find his artistic vision to be incredible. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice. However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this.
0	Beware the Fog...literally. "The Fog" is a fairly typical representative of a John Carpenter movie. It certainly has its moments, yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of "what might have been." In this sense it reminds me a bit of Michael Mann's 1985 version of F. Paul Wilson's "The Keep", another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which I watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good. Stripped to the bone, "The Fog" is the story of a small New England fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial (or bicentennial....or anniversary of some type). On the eve of this occasion the local priest, a drunken sot played by Hal Holbrook, discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding. This discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake, and is moving towards the town. Various characters in the town, including a local beer-guzzler (Tom Atkins) a nubile hitch-hiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) a radio deejay (Adrienne Barbeau) and so on, are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it, and how it is related to the "terrible secret", an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay. As you can see, while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool, and when I popped "The Fog" into my ancient DVD player recently I did so after a hiatus of many years, with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong. In this I was disappointed. Like "The Keep", "The Fog" never gets any better; unlike "The Keep" it actually gets worse. On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original "Halloween" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first onscreen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many. First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less. Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, "My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!" and "Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!" Gag. Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual "baddie" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. "The Fog" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal. The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws. As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category, but I really can't. It just isn't very good, and that's the sad fact of it. Bottom line? Beware The Fog.
0	Better Off with Seasons 1-3 Without a doubt the season had some pivotal moments. But too few and far between and without a clear story arc for Sydney. The return of Ms. Lena Olin gave it a shot in the arm, but too little too late. Dull villains and dispensing with the cliffhangers were major mistakes that effectively rendered the show toothless. A relentless snorefest considering the brilliance of previous seasons
1	Inspiring and artistic - Peacefull and magnificent at LAST ! one film with no fearfull scenes - (to be entertained doesnt mean someone needs to be frightened.. ) no nightmares ,...! AT LAST no unnecessary stupid killing. innocent JUST LIKE A KIDS HEART. beautifull images original imagination,.... INSPIRING ! SO artistic... all that critic others wrote, just has to do with technical stuff. kids dont see a film criticizing it - they watch it with their feeling, and this film is full of love , piece, honesty and respect, hurt and loss.. about feelings. SO NATURAL....not overplayed! . I dont want steril films that just keep my eye busy .. and I really dont think this film is in any way threatening to democratic beleifs... !!! I would say it gives kids the sense of authority...like their parents authority. I liked that the bad charakters werent over-the-top bad - they were just like people in reality are. they werent unnaturaly "absolute" bad guys and good guys. kids need to learn these things. that there arent just bad guys and just good guys. they need to see that good guys can do bad things and bad guys arent always totally bad guys but can be good also.. I LOVED Dinotopia and am gratefull that I had a chance to see it. will see the other movies with dinotopia too..
1	Nice boxset but the packaging! Ugh! I won't go on about the contents of this nice boxset as it has all been addressed already, but I thought I should add that upon receiving my shipment today I was dismayed to find all 3 discs rolling around free from their hubs! This poor packaging virtually guarantees damage to the DVDs...If it wasn't limited I would demand a replacement, but I'm not sending mine back and hope they still have one to replace it. The replacement would more than likely have the same loose DVD problem anyway. Boxset 4 stars, packaging (disc protection rated only) 0 stars. Disappointed
1	Magical and sparkling duo. The Harts, Max and Freeway made this one of the best series from the past.The chemistry between Wagner and Powers exploded on the screen.A modern day version of The Thin Man series of yester year, with William Powell and Merna Loy.They solved mysteries together getting tangeled up in all the plots and trying to get untangeled.Not without the help of Max, who was a character actor from the thirties and fortys and also acted with Shirley Temple. Can not wait for the third season dvd
1	Funny funny funny He is simply the funniest human on the planet at this time. I have, literally, laughed so hard at times I thought I might have a heart attack.
1	The Office Does Not Dissappoint! The BBC's version of the Office is a refreshing, intelligent depiction of today's business environment. Laced with sarcasm and gags that are so astounding they defy comprehension, it is worth suspening disbelief for optimal enjoyment! David Brent's portrayal of the idiot boss is genius. And his supporting characters - namely Gareth and Tim, are wonderful. After working in a corporation for many years, I could identify with many of the issues that arose and wish that I was able to respond in the ways that these characters respond. One takeaway, which I consider a serious one, is that honesty is underrated. Brent repeatedly puts his foot in his mouth for the things he says and many times, it's embarrassing to watch. But the beauty of Brent is his honesty and it makes his obnoctiousness tolerable. He tells it like it his, albiet distorted, but you always know where he stands (or is trying to stand!). Two thumbs way up for this box set which cleverly combined sharp wit with doses of reality. Loved the ending too
0	this one deserves a big fat zero this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?! you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far
0	These are the worst ever! My son loves "real life" trucks and big machines, so I thought these would be fun for him to watch. They are not, in fact they don't even hold his attention. Dave talks way too much and is way too goofy even for little kids. Just show the trucks in action and forget all the up close stuff on Dave. I have since bought the I Love CAT Machines series and they are fantastic
0	Where's the funny part? I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks.
1	kholuj i stavlennik imperializma This is not a film of Realism, but one of symbolic significance that perhaps only an acute observer of Russian culture would understand (Russian or non)--not to say that you could not watch the film and think that it is about abandonment, societal coldness, or irrational revenge, which it is on the surface. But if you go on here writing a bad review because perhaps you rented it for $3 on Netflix and it ruined your evening then I would suggest that you stick with The Stroll ( Progulka ) or something equally engaging that gives you a taste for modern Russia. Brave directors take chances, and that is why they are the best, but sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience. Most people on this side of the world are much too spoiled and naive to be able to grasp the horrors of having your world and everything you believe in turned upside down again and again and again until you have nothing to hold but the earth itself. No one blames you for that, and I really have no idea why you would buy this movie anyway, unless you simply love the beautiful cinematography. Sometimes movies do fail to make a point, but this is not one of them in my view. Basically, if you buy this film without watching it first then you are asking for trouble. Trust no one and make up your own mind by renting it first. Do not form presumptions because you like foreign movies or because you are a Tarkovsky fan. I would say that Tarkovsky is an influence on Zvyagintsev, but Zvyagintsev has his own ideas of what a film should do. Modern Russia, free Russia, is full of surprises. This is not a digital camera, you know. You have the unique opportunity to try it first before you buy. Amazon reviews are at you disposal. Make your decision. Rent it and then buy it...or do not. Why discourage others who have not had the chance to view it themselves? Do not give into Big brother. We are a democracy and we are strong. Think and evolve.
1	Ironic humor This film can be interpreted any number of ways: as a farce; a tragedy; or just plain Shakespearean comedy. Brenda Blethyn has, in the past, acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into Saving Grace with exquisite skill
1	action packed and very entertaining movie The great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes.The plot is easy to follow and all is the action and I think JJ abrams did a great job as director.This dvd is worth looking
0	Winkler was the good part If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development". Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive. Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences. Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans. Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves". A movie for history's circular file
0	The Brat Pack and those enormous granny panties This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set. The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying. Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect. Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall. Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least. Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered. Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college. It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came. Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia. I guess I was just a little more bitter. Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did. That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team. It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past. Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties. This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset. It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.
0	Fact is stranger than Fiction I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.
0	Poor History and a screenplay over-dramatic I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film. But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor. Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes. And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever. I was sorely disappointed! If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson. And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell. Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days. Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times. This film just doesn't cut it
1	I love the O.C. At first: When I bought the first season of the OC i did not know it. But then I watched the first episode and I loved it. All the Characters play so realistic. Each episode is different. Sometimes it's funny but is also often serious. After I watched all episodes I felt really sad, because I wanted to know how it goes on. But know the second season is out so I have more than 40 hours OC to watch. Of Course there are Extras in the box like interviews and something like that. And the quality of the discs is also great. I have never bought better DVDs than this. The OC is the best you can buy on DVD. And one of the best points is the very great price because you get almost 20 hours.
1	Amazing combat sequences Given that no special effects were used and that the film took two years to complete.... the aerial combat sequences are fantastic. The plot-lines are trivial, but universal. I think that the horrors of a seemingly endless war in Europe are well presented. This quite an enjoyable film, particularly if you are conversant with Howard Hughs dedication to get it made
1	30 year-old...going on 40 Perhaps Kurosawa's most darkly comic, "fun" movie. Based very loosely on a 1929 Dashiell Hammett (author of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man) novel entitled, Red Harvest, Yojimbo employs many of the same conventions. Namely, the nameless protagonist who finds himself in the supremely corrupt town, and, warned to leave, stays on to punish the guilty. Mainly for his own cynical amusement. The Yojimbo character is the worldly anti-hero, and the only truly self-aware person in the entire movie. He sees power-hunger, avarice, and cowardice for what they are and knows all too well how to manipulate the two warring factions into destroying each other. He is a ronin, a masterless samurai. Literally translated, it means "wave-man" or one who has been cast adrift on the waves. No master to serve but his own need to eat, his own whim, and no devices beyond his sword and resourcefulness. It is easy to discount the Yojimbo character as completely cynical, as a man loyal to none, who kills for the mere implementation of a plan, or for profit. But for as skewed his morality may be, I cannot agree. The Yojimbo character invariably throughout the course of the film makes moral choices, but denies all sentimentality in making them and claims (though probably falsely) other reasons for his actions: he frees the woman kept prisoner by the sake brewer and helps her escape with her family (giving them the money given him by one of his yakuza bosses); he spares the life of the foolish farm-boy who ran away to be a gambler only to cry for his mother at his first brush with death; and upon hearing the news that the inn-keeper (his only ally up to this point) has been imprisoned, he nearly rushes off to face down the dangerous and gunslinging Tatsuya Nakadai and co., armed with only a small knife. It is as if he views "normal" people differently. As if the samurai and yakuza are classes of people, like himself, who have accepted this violent way of life. That, having made that choice, anything that comes their way--including death or dismemberment--should not be a surprise or thought twice about. Toshiro Mifune's character may kill an evil man for amusement or for his own end, but he would not harm or rob an innocent man or debauch an innocent woman. He may be "a hungry dog, following the smell of blood", but it is not the blood of honest people. In The Dain Curse, another of Dashiell Hammett's books about the character from Red Harvest (known in several books and two dozen short stories as only "the Continental Op"--an operative for the Continental Detective Agency), the nameless man is told, smilingly, by the book's heroine that he is a monster...but a nice one, and good to have around when things are dark. I think that very much sums up the Yojimbo character as well, and also about how the character sees himself. Some critic in a review I read wrote that Tarantino does not make movies about violence so much as he makes movies about violent people, and their lives and thoughts and beliefs. I would say that Yojimbo and its excellent, hilarious, and insightful sequel Sanjuro certainly fall into that category. I think that Yojimbo is often written off by pseudo-intellectuals as Kurosawa's foray into "popcorn cinema", but I couldn't disagree more. I believe that this favorite movie of mine was Kurosawa's expression of the philosophy of Action, of Confrontation, of a 1960s jaded-but-not-corrupted Good versus Evil. Also, I would like to add, it has one of the BEST musical hero's themes in all of cinema
1	Not many better He is not a new comedian; right now he is the Man! What a range with clean or dirty jokes/stories. Mr. Harvey is one of the best out there.. OH, this DVD...Great
0	This movie is a clunker Wasted talent. None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying. Some funny stuff. Craig Ferguson can do better. Charlotte Church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte. Every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
0	hey, did any of you dudes catch that they ripped off the plot from clueless? this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade, with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic. fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of WHY i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind, but it was a mess.
0	Fails to come to a boil Laura Esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate,magical novel. Lumi Cavazos is a likeable Tita,struggling with her forbidden passion for Pedro.She's a sympathetic character&conveys her pain with her eyes.For a talented actress,I wonder what has become of her since. Marco Leonardi is not as sympathetic as Pedro.He comes across as a cheating scoundrel,causing pain for both his wife&his forbidden lover.One wonders why Tita loves him so much,except that it's forbidden.Marco Leonardi is,however,being true to the book.He uses Tita for his own pleasure;instead of bravely marrying her,he is a coward in marrying her sister&cheating on her. The movie renders less magical,or powerful,the scenes in the book.Instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti Western.One expects to see John Wayne riding to Tita's rescue. The magical scenes are hardly convincing,even for their time.The movie does have an excellent soundtrack.It's far inferior to the delectable,sensual novel
1	Cheetah Girls I love this movie i watched a lot and i cant wait to get the Cheetah Girls 2 movie in Nov or Dec they my favorite movie and i all the girls in it they did they parts well
0	A merciful two star rating; Look for future Arena Football Def. Coor. Stan Davis as 1 child actor & funny bit about Cheap Trick Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up, as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled onto this review by mistake
0	A misstep to be missed Unfortunately, this freshman effort from writer/director Maria Maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism. Littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances, "Two Girls in Love" is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment. For a more believable (as well as more intelligent and erotic) young lesbian love story, check out the understated and off-beat BBC production, "My Summer of Love" (2004). A similarly themed film that's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- "But I'm A Cheerleader" (1999) is a gem. From the same year, "Better Than Chocolate" has it all - humor, originality, plot, dialogue, performances, and sensuality. The only incredible thing about "Two Girls in Love" is that it got released in the first place, as without its lesbian twist it's little more than a third-rate Romeo and Juliet tale
1	Brat Pack I just have to ask how the other reviews can comment on how sloppy the package is when it isn't even released yet. They haven't seen it? The package is very cool, it is a notebook 3 ring binder with 3 protective sleeves for the discs and 1 for the music CD. This is a great package for those who grew up with the brat pack era. I know what the packaging looks like because I work for the company who made them
1	Robben Ford In Europe, Again! Well I am very surprized, frankly, that no one has reviewed this superb musical experience yet, so I will! This DVD was released in May 2005 and is the first real taste of Robben Ford live since his excellent live set in Baden-Baden Germany in the 1990s as part of the "Ohne Filter-Musik Pur" series-and they are all great! In this Paris set in 2001 Robben has his best band yet- with a great drummer, super bassist (check his solo in "Help the Poor") and, for the first time, keyboards. I can't praise this performance enough. Robben exhibits his style masterfully, without a lot of show, and demonstrates how he has successfully combined Jazz (especially Jazz Sax) with Chicago Electric Blues. Ford started around the Bay Area in the 1960s and built up a large following with the "Charles Ford Band" (named for his Dad) during the end of the Blues Power revival of the 1ate 1960s. He got to play with Charlie Mussellwhite and then Miles Davis which really extended his blues-jazz style and chops. I love the part in the interview (a great bonus feature!) where he said Miles liked him when he played his own stuff, his own way...not what Miles had originally thought he'd play. Well this DVD is well produced, has a good lenght and track selection and the sound is excellent, as you would expect from the Inaukstik people! The opening track "Prison Of Love" one of Fords strongest numbers is magnificent and sets the stage for the rest of the performance. It's a cool Jazz-Blues. The top selection of the DVD is "Help The Poor" from his most famous and acclaimed recording "Talk To Your Daughter". This version is great the the solos are as good as you'll ever hear from anyone! I always thought this and "Born Under A Bad Sign" were Ford's greatest songs ever! "Chevrolet" is a remake of a Donovan song "Hey Gyp"(Ford is a master of re-doing old tunes, especially blues, in a new groove and extending them!) This song was done by the Animals as well in the late 1960s. It is great! "Start It Up" is a Ford rock staple with his trusty 1960s telecaster, which he plays through most of this set-that's also unusual. His version of Mike McDonald's "Nothing To Nobody" is outstanding with its great jazz chord structure. The minor key blues offering "Moonchild Blues" is perhaps the second greatest tune on the DVD, it sounds very close to the Howlin' Wolf classic "Who's Been Talking"! You just want to keep on playing it! I highly recommend this DVD. It is the best new Blues inspired DVD of 2005 and a great addition to anyone's collection. If you only get one Robben Ford DVD, this is it! Great product and interesting bonus interview
0	rent, don't buy I rented this thinking it was an Audrey Tautou flick, but it isn't. She's front-and-center on the cover line-up, but she's only in a few scenes. That isn't the real reason why I think that this movie is so-so. There really isn't much in this movie that I haven't seen done elsewhere. I kept thinking that I've seen other movies do this or that better. Then again, I've seen a lot of foreign and independant films, so I've gotten a bit picky at times. Nothing was really clever or memmorable about this one. It's a mediocre flick, I don't know why it got rave reviews. I remember seeing the DVD in a sale bin at a discount store for $5 but I thought it would be a waste, because seeing it once was enough and I don't feel like I'll ever need to see it again
0	Waste of time I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.
0	Did You All Miss the Boat? After viewing the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao I must agree with the March 10th, 2000 reviewer who states strongly that this is just a solid "B" film. When I was growing up I spent many hours in movie theaters watching Fantasy and Sci-Fi films. George Pal movies were always among my favorites and still are. To make statements that the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao was George Pal's greatest film is unfounded. Have these people ever watched the Time Machine or War of the Worlds? If we are talking about great Fantasy or Sci-Fi movies, which George Pal should be remembered for, then you don't get much better than these two. The only credit to this film is the scene where Dr. Lao shows the town's people the movie clips of the Roman city being destroyed by a vocanic eruption. The eruption scenes are taken from another George Pal classic fantasty film, Atlantis the Lost Continent. Now there is a great film to entertain the children. The only problem with Atlantis the Lost Continent is that for some unknown reason it has not yet been released on DVD. For those of us out there that still enjoy great fantasy films from the past, drop the studio a line and lets get this one on the market
1	Could be one of the best... I sat front row for this show in Vegas, you even see me about 5 times during the comedy central version of the show. Dane even gave me a high 5 (that missed barely) and was thankfully cut...lol. I can tell you the CC version had ALOT cut out, and was still VERY funny. I am really looking forward to seeing if the added material is the really rauchy HILARIOUS stuff. Sean Rouse was just as funny if not better than Dane... but it was VERY racy... I'd definitely buy if that stuff was back in... probably will anyways to remember my first appearance on Comedy Central too! You'll love it either way, but man I hope they decided to show the whole sets of each guy
1	Fun, fast and challenging (if all done together) :-> This is a great workout as a whole (or more than one segment at least). Michelle Dozois (Shape dvd's) is energetic and enthusiastic without going overboard. She is motivating and cues very well. The five segments are Slow and Steady Burn, Carb Killer, Power Blast, Interval Burn and Metabolism Booster. The thing I like about this is that you can customise your own workout or do them in order. There's great music to also keep you motivated and give you a good workout routine. The only problem is that you really should do a minimum of two workouts in a row or you won't get as much benefit as possible. One segment is fine on it's own if you are topping up from another routine you do. But overall, I think everyone will like this because it's great if you are short on time and because you can mix it up, it doesn't get boring. I love it
1	Hugh Laurie is the best actor on television - he has no equal House is the best show on television. There's never been a medical show like this - ever, and I've seen just about all of them. And to have someone of Hugh Laurie's caliber and immense talent is such a great treat for viewers. There is nothing this man can't do. Brilliant and genius are overused words, but in his case, they more than apply. His background in so many British comedies prepared him well for the role of House, but what's so amazing is how he can go from making you laugh one minute, to playing pain and drama like nobody's business. The DVD's are so clear and sharp, and those mesmerizing blue eyes of his are just mind boggling! When the light hits them a certain way, you cannot look at anything or anyone else in the scene. Hugh, if you're reading this I know you hate hearing it, but you are brilliant and sexy as hell!!!! The best show on television, bar none
1	The Governator shows his soft side This movie gets spoofed in JibJab's short film "Ah-nold for Governor" in which the Governator cites the movie as evidence of his gubernatorial political qualifications. Hey, it's a lot more convincing than John Kerry's. Especially since this movie is so irresistible. You just have to see the scene in which John Kimble reads the kids a poem about clouds. (Incidentally, it's Spring Morning" from A.A. Milne's book, "When We Were Very Young.") Schwarzenegger displays a Richard Belzer kind of tenderness. Then he will turn around and beat the living daylights out of the abusive father in the film ("He fell down. You all say the same thing.") Kimble's relationship with Grace is moving and convincing and his camaraderie with his female partner Phoebe is evocative of Detectives Benson and Stabler in "Law & Order: SVU". I love the scene in which he makes up an entire background (something cops are used to doing) and Phoebe pretends to have an Austrian accent (she's almost more convincing than Ah-nold.) The childrens' loyalty and response to Kimble is a joy to see. Schwarzenegger's work with children and his natural charisma make this fish-out-of-water story work. Anyone who's ever taught children will empathize with Kimble's disastrous first day. There are great villains in this piece too, including a mother-in-law from hell. My favorite lines... Phoebe: You're not so tough without your car, are you? Detective John Kimble: There *is* no bathroom. Joseph: Boys have a penis, girls have a vagina! Detective John Kimble: Thanks for the tip. Tina & Rina: Our mom says our dad is a real sex machine. Joseph: My dad's a gynecologist. He looks at vaginas all day long. Detective John Kimble: I Have a headache. Lowell: It might be a tumor. Detective John Kimble: It's not a tumor! Miss Schlowski: What did it feel like to hit that S.O.B.? Detective John Kimble: It felt great. (I love how the principal then starts practicing her right hook once Kimble leaves her office. You don't want to mess with this woman anyway, right hook or no.) Detective John Kimble: Just don't throw up on me. Phoebe: Nah, it's OK, I'm not gonna throw up on you. But I am gonna kiss you! Detective John Kimble: I really appreciate your honesty. You happen to know someone that is not better than me? Dominic: I don't know that many people. Detective John Kimble: They're 6-year-old kids. How much trouble can they be? Phoebe: On second thought, take the gun. Crisp's mother is buying a heap of pediatric medication Cullen Crisp: The boy's not sick. Eleanor Crisp: Doesn't hurt to take precautions. Cullen Crisp: Mother, you are going to make him sick. You stuffed all this crap down my throat for years, and there was nothing wrong with me! Eleanor Crisp: That's why there was nothing wrong with you. Cullen Crisp: Now, how can you argue with that? Great comedy.
0	Unbox Sucks It tells me 'no device to download to'. Amazon, debug your product before you take people's money!! You are acting like Microsoft. There is no way to report this to Amazon. Does anybody there care anymore?
0	Awful The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about
1	It's about time! Finally, in this day of PC pablum, someone tells the REAL history of the Confederate soldier! You'll learn little-known facts about the major players, including General Lee of course, but more importantly, this set focuses heavily on the average man in the ranks and why he chose to fight. Daily camp life gets attention as well as what the soldier wore and what equipment he used. The real reasons and motivations for fighting are explored and what life was like after the war when men had to go home in defeat to often-devastated homes. Highly recommend! It's a must for serious students of the war and anyone who wants an authentic look at the period
0	It's ok. I only bought this one for the song by Jerry Orbach. The first 2 DVDs were better
0	John Tucker lives??? Okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as "Bring it on", "Clueless", "Mean Girls" and, especially the superior "Heathers".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, "John Tucker Must Die" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. "JTMD" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. "Heathers" = 5 stars. "Mean Girls" = 4 stars. "Bring it on" = 4 stars. "Clueless" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that "John Tucker Must Die" doesnt have..
0	Another teen movie, by adults, that hates kids. Never mind's that it's pretty stupid - "John Tucker Must Die," like a lot of movies about high-schoolers, actually hates high school and just about everybody in it, and by extension, American kids; it's the kind of movie that, if parents caught an hour of it, would make them think less of their children for watching it, and to a fearsome extent, pretending to live it out. Early in the movie one character, a cheerleader, remarks about stealing her mother's estrogen pills: "Well, guys use steroids to build their pecs." That estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader's breasts is laughable, but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual, sickening line of the year. But it is what to expect from Hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild, girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous "Laguna Beach" hacks who use insidious, and I mean insidious, editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched, again and again in the sloppiest manner, to the previous line of dialogue. "JTMD" asks us to believe that the title character (Jesse Metcalf) simultaneously dates three women (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) without them knowing it, is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town, owns a great car, stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games, and my personal favorite, owns and drives a yacht. He and his brother have no parents to speak of. Neither do the three girls, unless you count the cheerleader's mom reference. One of them (Bush) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen, however. And when they discover they've all been dating the same guy in gym class, they get in a brawl and are not suspended, but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher. Is this a satire, as "JTMD" bills itself? An edgy comedy? A smarter, cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline, in this post-Columbine world, for looking at each other funny, and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news. A cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete, but, say head of the drama club. A cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase, ultra-hardened brat girls, but sweet, emotional, sunny girls. A cleverer film would know a dark comedy, if that's what "JTMD" intends to be, can't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven. Instead we have a fourth, "smart" girl (Brittany Snow) is introduced as the girls' grand, "Taming of the Shrew" plan to woo John and eventually stomp his heart. This angel, of course, begins to fall for John, who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy, which are, if we follow our MTV, two of the trinity (the last being sheer, drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have, preferably brown) that makes up male desirability. Director Betty Thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to. Ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick, adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading, in an empowered, open society that has a foreign Hindu woman as CEO of Pepsi, represents the canopy of female of achievement. Go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid! We've been pounding this Earth for years now. Why do teens and young women still trail along, lapping it up? There is no real wit in the movie that you can't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a VH1 program, no style, no genuine attitude. It's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty, young, rotten, unidealistic America most interested in getting tail, getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties. It is not immoral so much as it blank, a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic, most involving self-debasement of young bodies. What fools Hollywood sees our children to be, wants them to be. What numb, donkey fools. If you need more proof, Jenny McCarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she's borderline believable. Ya know, so much ugliness is spewed about "Islamofascists," these manaical, stoneaged fiends who apparently can't tell you the sky is blue, spending most of their time taping martyr videos, finding Mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life. Consider, though, that one of the more recognizable items in Muslim countries is the satellite dish . A year from now, this thing's on a movie channel, and well, whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the American decline into shame, they've got it. Not because it's absent morals, but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be.
1	Sturges at His Best Years ago, in the days before cable, there were six or seven television stations in Chicago. Only a few of them had programming late at night. There weren't channels to flip between; when you found a movie you liked, you actually watched it. One weekend night, I came home late and found my sister watching the late-late show on WGN. "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" had just started and we had never seen anything quite like it. A good Sturges movie is as close as you can get to a rollercoaster ride without going to an amusement park. And this movie is as wild a ride as any Sturges movie. I have seen this movie a number of times over the last 30 years and each time I am almost doubling over with laughter. I can't wait to get it on DVD. For a few years in the 1940s Preston Sturges was a brilliant shinning star. As far as I am concerned, he never shone brighter than he did in this "Miracle."
0	ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING AS WATCHING MICHAEL JACKSON DRY-HUMP HOWDY DOODY I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (...
0	Pathetic Can't remember when I've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this. A has-been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer, down on his luck. The writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property, and hides his car trying to escape a Finance Co. The threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine. In one early scene they have a funeral, casket and all, for a monkey. Yuk. Gloria Swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script, though she despises movies that "talk". She waves her hands about, and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene. She falls for the screen writer, William Holden, and won't let him out of her sight. The film was made in 1950, and Swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50, not exacty over the hill (if we look at many of today's movie stars.) But she's treated in the film as though she much, much older. I thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so, but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film. My heavens, at 50 she could still be in movies, and from the amount of money she apparently had, didn't need to be living in such a dark, creepy house. Film didn't make sense. Sorry I bought it. It was ridiculous.

0	The novelty's worn off, and it's left as a former shell of itself On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent.
1	pretty good This is a very basic video showing you what you need for a basic sensual dance. I was expecting a little more and the porn at the end was a lil surprising and unneccessary. Overall though it does show you a basic dance that you can build from
1	I felt like a beginner! I had been working out on a stability for about 6 months and I thought this would be a change of pace for me and figured being a "beginner" workout I wouldn't have a problem. Boy was I wrong! I felt like a true beginner as I worked through the routine and was wobbling all over. Regardless, I still "felt" the results of the workout. It took me several repetitions to start to control myself on the ball and feel like I was actually mastering the moves. This routine now has a permenant place in my exercise rotation and I love all that I'm able to do. Don't be scared away. Stick to it and you'll love the way it makes you feel and the results you'll get
1	Worthy of the wealth it garnered, and the awards... I liked this version of the Titanic story when I saw it on the big screen, and I've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912. I've been a Titanic buff for 50 years now, and read most of the books. However, last weekend I went to a museum to see "Artifacts of the Titanic", a collection of more than 100 items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down, things once connected to the White Star Line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater. It was incredibly moving and sad. Connected with the exhibit was an IMAX showing of James Cameron's "Ghosts of the Abyss." The "Titanic" director took some of his enormous profits from this 1998 release, and in 2001 he rented a Russian ship, two submersible submarines, and two robotic cameras, and went down to the wreck himself, taking along actor Bill Paxton from the movie. The resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent. If you get a chance to see it, or the salvaged items, don't pass it up. Meanwhile, the movie works. So have most of the earlier versions, and so have most of the books, because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes. The fictional parts of Cameron's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster, in my view. Seeing the artifacts and the wreck on a 58-foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again, on a big screen.
1	Madchester Madness One of the best casts in a long long time, great british comedians such as steve coogan, peter kay, rob brydon, simon pegg. A very funny movies, based on a true story about tony wilson the founder of the hacienda ( a famous nightclub in the 90's in manchester UK), this movie is a must see for people into punk and dance
1	net to you an anime must have. an introduction to an incredible movie series. It started the ghost in the shell stand alone complex.
0	Lousy DVD from Hart Sharp Video This review refers to the uncut DVD version. Like the other reviewers here, I loved this movie. The movie I would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress Juliette Marquis (from Ukraine no less). The image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video. I can undertand and accept that. This DVD however is a lousy Pan and Scan version. Some movies can be Pan and Scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future TV transfers in mind. But this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and didn't make room for transfer to fullscreen TV. It is intensely frustrating to watch this damned DVD. You watch noses talking to half faces, half faces talking to ears, heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly. I am furious at the studio a__holes at Hart Sharp Video who sanctioned this Pan and Scan monstrosity. And they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen. To add insult to injury, they show pictures on the back cover and the insert, of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the Pan and Scan cropped crap. Hart Sharp Video goes straight to my list of Never Buy From Again. By all means see this movie - at the theater. Or wait till a more responsible company releases a new DVD edition
0	Another disappointing Marvel movie Who's idea was it to put Jessica Alba as Sue Storm? Chris Evans's portrayal of Johnny Storm was somewhat disappointing too, although not as bad as Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm. Why do they cast Hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies? They really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters. This movie was somewhat good, but it didn't feel all that great. So far, this movie is just another of Marvel's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, Xmen 3, Daredevil, and The Punisher. I was so happy to see Marvel characters getting their own movies, but after seeing what Hollywood does to them, I would rather see Marvel's chracters go back into hiding. Special effects were good in this movie, and so was the story. Michael Chiklis as the Thing was great, and his The Thing character makeup was done very well, and he played the character well too, as did Ioan Gruffud with Mr. Fantastic. Jessica Alba and Chris Evans definitely demoted this movie
0	Yuck! This was a complete waste. Walken is good, but God what a waste! I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me. But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything. He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion. This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it. After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot. But I'm still human. I still have opinions. And my opinion of this is, yuck
0	Ramtha Who??? You know it's interesting, when you open the Ramtha web site of the "School of Wisdom", one finds a high school essay in NeoPlatonic Metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats, however when you hit the link that says who is Ramtha, you get a "this information is not available" message, kinda makes you go, HHMMMMMMM????!!! now don't get me wrong folks, Edgar Cayce and the author of a Course in Miracles might have tapped into something, but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative, it kind of reminds me of the lines in the Revenge of the Sith movie that Palpatine gave to Anakin to turn him to the dark side!!!!! You know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik, you know esteemed Jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the Sith; or even Tolkien's Saruman, hey folks get Christopher Lee's opinion of the DVD before you fork over your hard earned bucks, and uh...do a search on this Ramtha spirit, er channeled, er thingy!!! Live Long and Prosper!!
1	Awww... This movie is incredible. It has a great way of deminstating how judgemental people that shouldn't be judgemental are. This movie catches your heart and you get wrapped up in it. 5 STARS for sure. Its was an incredible movi
1	Awesome. A must have for anime comedy fans Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard "The magnificent world". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon). Well, I have to say that the bad reviews are wrong. This DVD series was totally awesome (although I admit it started a bit slow). I promise the more you keep watching, the better it gets. The plot is highly intelligent (involving dimensional and time travel) and the characters are very interesting (with distinctive special powers). Some say the humor in El Hazard is juvenile (but I would argue no more juvenile then southpark), and seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile? Some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant (because many episodes involve a doomsday device), to which I respond "Do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star"? no, ofcourse not. yes this DVD set lacks some extras, but I think Pioneer did a great job. The DVD menu presentation is beautiful, and the box is very elegant too. Hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on Ebay (beware of bootlegs). It's very hard to find a good authentic set. The sequel "alternative world" which I just ordered, individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart. For my fellow anime comedy fans, I also reccomend "Niea under 7" and "His and Her Circumstances". animation=5 plot=4 music=4 characters=5 comedy=4 Total= 4.4 Star
1	Kylie Minogue Showgirl DVD Another great concert put out by Kylie. She covers a little bit of everything from her career. The only complaint I may have is that there was a spot where the concert drug. Too bad that the fans in the U.S. have been deprived by her talent all these years. I wish that she would put out a DVD with all of her videos, Something like the Ultimate Kylie she released last year. I hope she keeps it going for years to come
1	The nastiness against the epic innocence! A haunting portrait which reflects the anguish universe of the childhood, its fears, disillusions and hopes. The finding of a wild child under the ground, will become the dramatic premise to confront two visions and fortunately opposite ways of living. A honest script. Suggestive dialogues, admirable photography and enrapturing shot angles.
0	Good but German version from Amazon.de is better.....than UK SE Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery. The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation. Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything. Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well. They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide.....
1	Buckethead Has It All! This is an amazing DVD! Buckethead covers the entire spectrum! He covers everything from science fiction, horror, zombies, classical art, pop art, funk, jazz, rock, alternative, progressive, etc. He is definately the Frank Zappa of the new century. His guitar playing is incredible and his compositions are mind boggling. I thoroughly enjoyed everything I have seen so far (I am only through the first disc). But the navigation was no problem and extremely interesting. I loved the announcers voice! I was immediately smiling and sometimes laughing outloud! I just love his take on things. Just the video for the Wheels of Torment is worth the price of the DVD. An amazing video. How did they take the classical painting of hell and disect it and animate it and throw in images of Buckethead playing guitar - or was it a mandolin? I also loved the Ballad of Buckethead with Les Claypool - He's alive, He's half dead, Folks just call him Buckethead! Great! The Dental Commander was interesting animation and the Bootsy Collins - Funky Express Card was so damned funny I couldn't stop laughing. As well as the with the clips of the japanese monsters invading Tokyo. I also loved hearing his early demos for Guitar Player. Absolutely amazing guitar and composition. I really recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the guitar work of Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Mike Keneally, Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew, John Petrucci, etc. This guy is in the same league and then some. A very important guitar hero and composer. This DVD is worth ten times the cost. Don't miss it
1	Absolute excellence Throne of Blood is a masterpiece by one of the world's greatest film makers at the height of his powers. Only Kurosawa could take the essence of Shakespearian stage drama and incorporate it into the medium of film as a dynamic tour de force. Yet at the same time he remains faithful to elements of Noh (a stagy traditional Japanese play-form in which design and movement are minimalized). A seeming contradiction, dynamism and static-ness yet Kurosawa masters both in the same medium. As usual; acting, writing, cinematography, sound, direction and production are all pitch perfect. In this second Shakespearian based film by Kurosawa, focus is on the interplay of fate, free will and the fine thread the human psyche uses to weave the two together. On a more simpler level it is a man living and dying by the sword. In short what goes around comes around. What comes around for Toshiro Mifune as he gets his just deserts is a scene with straight as an arrow, perfect direction by Kurosawa leading to quite a pointed culminatin of events (pun intended...see the movie you'll understand). Bonus features include excellent linear notes as well as the superb commentary of Donald Richie. Few people are more knowledgeable about film and Japanese film then he. The commentary is almost as interesting as the movie itself. As usual Criterion presents its film in pristine condition. Some may complain that Criterion is too pricey but with them you get the best cinema has to offer. You cannot go wrong. One Kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy, punch and philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times the movie at 5 times the price, really quite a deal if you look at it that way.
0	What a pity! I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5. In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films. The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series. It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it. I think they could pull off one more film. Ripley's a great hero. This movie was pretty bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects. I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien. Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money. The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent. Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement. This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair.
0	Bland, predictable and cliche... There are certainly some memorable scenes in this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me. Vlastimil Brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character: Fanda, a maddening yet adorable grandpa, oh-so-young-at-heart, oh-so-mischievious and impish, but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you can't help loving him warts and all. In fact, that's one of the fatal flaws of this movie: the lack of any dark side to any of the characters. They're all basically harmless Walt Disney types, even the bumbling and self-absorbed son. There are no real consequences to Brodsky's actions other than Stella (his wife) finally talking divorce but it's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she'll come back to him. There is no center, no force or dynamic power in this film---it's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don't want to hurt the feelings of your host. The ending also relies on another lazy device, the virtual deux ex machina in the person of Stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of Fanda's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable. This film might've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with Fanda's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death, instead of focusing on how clever, audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is, which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse, narcissism. One wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with Mr. Brodsky, who is a towering figure among Czech actors, that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him. A more accurate title for this movie, especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll, might be: "The Fantasy Life of a Poor Old Man."
0	Very disappointed and frustrated Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition, as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves. To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the "cheesiness" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way. I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun
1	Unbelievable, but enjoyable Yep, it's another romantic comedy ... with a twist. Enter an account exec who, thru an accident w/ a hairdryer at home can hear women's thoughts. This is a pure bunk, pure enjoyment film .. and Mel Gibson addresses it with style. While the film may not win any big awards, it's great fun to watch again and again. And I'm not one who's big on romance comedies. Want to grin and chuckle thru the evening? Give this one a look. Suitable for the whole family, but it's likely that kids under 12 will find it boring. recommended. ~ P
0	CRUEL EXAMPLE OF CULTURAL IMPERIALISM AT ITS WORST: WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS I too was mesmerized by this documentary, as an educator and student of child psychology, etc. THen I heard the running commentary, especially the remarks of the cameraman, and realized what a vile example of grotesque cultural imperialism this is: using despised children for selfish purposes=prostitution. THe cameraman calls one of the children a whiny b#tch (his words) and has a rather obviously ambiguous relation with another of the girls. The inclusion of these comments and some of the stills casts a telling pall over the entire enterprise. Often under the guise of doing good we exact greatest harm, as Mr. Oscar Wilde noted. This despicable film takes kids, uses them and disposes of them with the sneering arrogant attitude so overtly and unselfconciously expressed in the commentary by the cameraman, divides families and friendships, exposes children to realizing painfully and traumatically their condition, like Liza Dolittle, without hope of going either back or forward. The pain on their faces as they observe the film is especially telling
0	Had Promise, but Failed to Deliver. I have to agree with the other reviewers. "Legend of the Rangers" looked promising but ultimately didn't deliver. The sets and effects are excellent and the actinng's not bad. And of course it was great seeing Andreas Katsulas reprise his role as Narn ambassador, now citizen, G'Kar, however these three elements couldn't save the film. The mysterious alien race threatening the Liandra's crew were too much like the Shadows of the series. If you're a die-hard B-5 fan you'll want this film, but if you're looking for an introduction to B-5 go with the season box sets. All-in-all not JMS' best. Which is sad because it had promise
0	left a bad taste I searched for reviews of this movie before I saw it, and didn't find any. People I talked to had not seen it, but had heard it was good. So I finally sat down and watched it. The acting was top notch. It was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships. One in a nursing home, and one in the friendship retold by Cleo Threadgoode during those visits. On the down side it was very feministic, to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres. Women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women. Kathy Bates' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a "don't push me" type. While much of this was funny, this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground. In spite of this I enjoyed the first part of the movie. That is until the surprise ending. While this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler, the ending involved unwitting cannibalism. This made me sick, and I felt sick a long time after watching it. Had I known how sour the ending would be, I never would have watched this movie
1	Signs, the movie Good quality film. Amazon kept me informed of shipment. Good servic
0	Heartburn or Men..beware ! Most women only want to breed ! This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant &quot;homemaker&quot;. If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too
1	War and Rembrance "War and Remberance" is a is the conclusion to Herman Wouk's "Winds of War". The characters we follow in this series are ficitional though the setting of pre-world two and the carnage of the actual war is real. The story is true to life in every aspect. The actors in the story are excellent! The story of the Henry's, the Jastrow's is heartbreaking. The concentration camp settings are so real,one is not likely to forget the personal side war of Hitler. This story makes you ask how did one person, Hitler, who indeed was mad, "weild so much power?" This series is well worth the watching.
1	We love Brainy Baby at our house. I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys. I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old. He loves them. And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen. :) As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile. He is captivated. I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos. And the toys.......he LOVES them. "Hello, Brainy Baby!" They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box. I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time. We love Brainy Baby at our house.
1	Excellent learning tool Wow, what an excellent DVD! Since the first time we put it on for our 20 months old daughter, she has been hooked to it. This is an excellent DVD for kids starting from 6 months. Lots and lots of color and classical music keep the kid busy constantly. The combination of colors, objects and music greatly enhances their ability to think and relate to everyday things. I highly recommend this to all parents. My wife found out about this while searching for Baby Einstein DVD.
0	Gag me with a spoon!!! I found this film to be a total waste of otherwise good talent. It should be rated X. I didn't know "Johnny" could stoop so low. It made me want to barf!!
1	Classic - Peyton Place If you liked Peyton Place, you will love this movie. Jeff Chandler does a great job portraying "the publisher" of Allison's book as well as her lover for the moment. This also has a variety of things happening in Peyton Place that you will find interesting
1	Let There Be peace On Earth This powerful and thought evoking film depicts an actual incident which took place on Christmas Eve, 1914. The film juxtaposes the great beauty of Christ's birth with the unspeakable human tragedy of war. The events chronicled in this film took place on the killing fields of France where The French and Scottish armies were entrenched across from the German army. Here these powerful armies slaughtered each other for four years never giving up more than 25 miles of teritory either way. On this special Christmas eve, the first of the Great War, these armies saw a chance to stop the killing to celebrate the birth of the prince of peace. As the soldiers emerged from their trenches, littered with human filth and rotting corpses, one can not help but sense an immediate rebirth. In doing so, they recognized their common humanity and fulfilled the promise of Christ's birth which is "Let There Be Peace on Earth". The film is wonderfully acted and the attention to detail is spectacular. The most moving scene of this film is when the Scottish priest celebrates mass in latin (as was done back then) to the Sottish, French and German soldiers. While all speak their own language they were able to experience a spritual moment in the common language of the Catholic mass. This simple act of mass reminds the viewer of the good that comes when human beings focus on the commonalities that bind us and not the differences that tend to destroy us. I highly remommend this wonderful film to anyone who believes in the inherent promise of humanity and the power of good versus evil.
1	Violent, thought provoking, and disturbing all in one. Gantz is a very violent anime that aired on Japanese television only after SERIOUS editing. Gantz follows the story of Kei, a young student who somehow finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. His long-lost friend, Kato, shows up in the subway where Kei is also waiting for a train, just in time to see a homeless man fall onto the tracks below. Being the kind soul that Kato is, he runs to the man's aid, and after spotting Kei on the platform, calls for his help as well. Peer pressure wins and Kei too joins the struggle. After saving the man, they are stuck on the tracks as a passing train comes barreling down the tracks at them. In a battle of legs versus wheels, it is obvious who wins, and the oncoming train almost instantly decapitates Kei and Kato. At the very brink of death, Kei's last thoughts are "why me?" which eventually leads to "this is the way it's gotta be," as he see himself falling to the ground below. At the last possible instant, the machine known only as Gantz rescues Kei and Kato and places them in a room with other "survivors." A countdown shows up on the large black globe known as Gantz, and the game begins. Kill or be killed...the once hunted has become the hunter, and Kei and Kato find themselves surrounded by bloodthirsty monsters that would love nothing more than to make them their next meal. The bloodshed is enormous, the bodies are piling up, and behind it all is Gantz. While stuck in a purgatory state, Kei and Kato realize that they are neither truly alive nor truly dead. Live through the game and you are free to go, until the next round begins. Fail at the game, and you will face a fate worse than death. Filled with LOTS of internal monologues on the part of Kei, Gantz is a series that allows for incredible character development. In the space between heaven and hell, Kei must fight his own demons as well as those that he is battling against. Loyalty and hormones come into question, and the battles continue as more "survivors" enter the mix. Cursing and nudity are littered everywhere in this series, but it does nothing to take away from its quality. Gantz is definitely not something for the kiddies, but it is a great series for the anime junkie in all of us. Season two was recently released, so let the games continue...
0	"You're going down Burnhead" ??? I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment! There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting. Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others. It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement. In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims.... In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average. The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category. The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the "fool," Ted Raimi, from the Xena series). Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really... In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it. No masterpiece here... 2 Stars
1	Fun and entertaining I cannot help but laugh every time I see people bashing each other over a movie. Disliking a certain film is one thing. But for somebody to go out of their way and flagrantly insult a total stranger over their enjoyment of a particular film they happened to hate is unnecessary and immature. Amazon should police these reviews a bit more seriously. "Critters" is a fond and harmless throwback to the sort of monster movie so prevalent in the mid-1950s sci-fi boom. I cannot so easily classify the plot as straight-up horror, because it really isn't. This is more of a hodgepodge. You get a smattering of horror, comedy, and science fiction all rolled up within a singular and satisfying package. I caught this in a theater with my father twenty years ago, and it has always remained a guilty pleasure of mine. None of the special effects are overdone, the writing is suitable, and I found most of the cast agreeable and entertaining. I have found over the years that many of us tend to take our movies way too seriously. In the end, I could really care less that "Critters" doesn't follow the rules of reality. Because, when I pay to see movies like this, reality is something I want to escape from.
0	I agree with "Brodyman", a Gremlins wannabe..... A very cheap quick ripoff of a commercial success of Gremlins. The kid below me is to stupid to know what good films are. Take the pacifier out of your mouth and change your diapers, Mommas boy
1	This documentary was a bit weak 9-11 was meticulously planned out by our government. If people do not believe me, go read and study that day like it was your babay and you'll find the truth. I was a bit skeptical at first as well. Now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in. This isn't the UNited States of America, this is the beginning of a NEw World Order. Don't believe me, we'll probably never know, because we'll be spoonfed our news on the war in Iraq by the Corporate Media that controls and censors what we see and DON'T SEE! Don't think so? You, along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in Iraq by watching CNN (Censored News Network), or Fauxnews. It pains me that people still don't realize that there is no fight for democracy in Iraq. Its a fight for Imperial Ambitions, we need Iraq for Oil, and to set up a puppet government so it doesn't scare Israel, our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of "radical muslim fundamentalists." No one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself, instead of relying on "experts" who "know" what is going on. I thought we were intelligent people, us Americans? Most of you can't even figure out wat the problem really is. Its our corrupt government
0	Complete waste of time! The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a "Forrest Gump" imitation. Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying. The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study). Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era.....
1	Well Worth the Wait The conflicting reviews on this one made me stop and think, but I decided to purchase it anyway, and I am glad that I did. For those who are puzzled or disappointed by the absence of Gibson guitars, Marshall amps, etc., I would recommend that they watch the interview segments on Disc 2, in which Bruce explains that they had originally tried the Gibson/Marshall setup, but that it simply did not work. It would be well to consider that Cream had not played together for 37 years, so that it was rather like forming a new band; however, this set affirms that all the elements are still in place, and the band delivers solid performances throughout. There are some persons who contend that Baker and Bruce were broke and desperate, and somehow convinced Clapton to play with them to bail them out. However, in the interview segments, both Clapton and Baker confirm that it was Clapton's idea, with Baker stating that he "wasn't very keen on doing it" initially, until Clapton coaxed him into it. Bruce looks terribly frail, and is seated during some parts of the show; however, his bass and vocal work are superb. Clapton, who has aged well, shows that he has lost none of the fire and flair of the old days, and the 68-year-old Baker displays a level of skill and stamina rarely seen in drummers half his age. While it is true that these performances are somewhat different from the originals, the updated renditions are amazingly good; after all, improvisation was always one of the factors which set Cream apart from other bands. In an era when phony, hybrid versions of 60's-era bands seem to be everywhere, it is refreshing to see all the original members of one of the most influential bands of all time put aside their differences, re-form, and deliver quality performances of some of the greatest songs ever written. Having viewed this set several times since buying it, I feel that it would have been a bargain at twice the price. Thanks and kudos to Ginger, Jack, and Eric - long live the Cream
1	Deep and moving Remains of the Day requires the viewer to be observant. Anthony Hopkins takes on the challenge of playing a man who is emotionally repressed and self-effacing, a butler who has complete, blind faith in his master and thinks only to serve him. Hopkins is such a gifted actor that he can slip into the role seamlessly while still suggesting - so long as you watch closely - private emotions in this restrained and stilted figure. These emotions are often not fully understood by his character or dealt with properly, but Hopkins puts them there - they might be revealed in a gesture of the hand, a jaw unhinging slightly, eyes lingering more than is strictly necessary. Hopkins is simply fascinating to watch. He plays the butler Stevens, who in the years leading up to WWII serves Lord Darlington in a grand English country house. Stevens is loyal to his master; he never questions him, never eavesdrops on his conversations, and assumes that his master has a great and complete understanding of the word. Lord Darlington, however, turns out to be a Nazi appeaser; he wishes to play it safe and make a deal with Germany rather than go to war. He holds a gathering of like-minded noblemen and high officials in his house, where only one American politician, Lewis (Christopher Reeve), contradicts him and his policies of appeasement. When Darlington asks Stevens to remove two housemaids who are Jewish refugees, Stevens does so with some confusion but without argument. After all, his master understands more than he. He has to attend to the guests at the gathering, deal with his elderly father, an underbutler, who is growing too old for his duties, and handle the housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who has no problem contradicting Stevens and disturbing what little private time he sets aside each day for himself. Emma Thompson plays Miss Kenton with honesty, intelligence, and vitality. The conversations between Kenton and Stevens often seem to be in some kind of code - on the surface they speak of housekeeping matters, or perhaps that sentimental book that Stevens reads in private and attempts to conceal... but matters of greater urgency are touched upon. Stevens is affected by Kenton, but seems immoveable as stone; he has sacrificed too much of himself to his service, and he is couched in duty and routine. He can easily see if a single spoon is missing from the dinner table, but cannot put words to his emotions, such as they are. Would it ever be possible for him to change? Just as Darlington's loyalties were grossly misplaced and repented too late, perhaps Stevens will also find himself only with regrets. Remains of the Day is a fine, moving, nuanced picture, with rich performances.
1	certain shade of green this is a great dvd for any fan. the middle of the show sometimes seems slow, but the 10+ minute version of vitamin is worth the price alone. the extra cd that comes with the dvd is also good for anyone who doesnt have some of the songs in their collection already. "Follow" is a great song and hopefully their new cd this summer will have more songs like it
0	Shaggy Dog This movie was very disturbing to me,I did'nt like seeing the freaky animals in cages.The frog with the dog head bothered me.I don't recommend this movie for small children as they would take it too serious. There were some funny parts and Tim Allen played a very good role. I am an animal lover and I don't like seeing any kind of mistreatment of animals even if it is a movie. Now I know why this movie never came to my local theatre
0	A Two-hour Unfunny Comedy Don't get me wrong. I love Bill Murray and I'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he's deserved. But these Wes Anderson "comedies" are just lame. RUSHMORE started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out. THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS was a two-hour set-up without ever starting any story (it felt like two-hours even if it wasn't). And now THE LIFE AQUATIC. All of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts. I don't think there's been a good comedy since A FISH CALLED WANDA in 1988 (although parts of THE BIG LEBOWSKI are hilarious) so I don't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies. Most stink. Maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy. That might explain the glowing reviews here. Although Anderson's films are competently made, they feel stuffy and pretentious. Humorless. I chuckled once per hour. Not a good average. I don't think this movie ever makes up its mind. And I'm so sick of Owen Wilson that I wish Hollywood would give him a paid vacation. Does he have to be in every single movie ever made
1	I suppose... that "Blackout" is being held for the season 5 release so all of the Johnny Depp die-hards will by it. Nice marketing strategy. 21 Jumpstreet has always been one of my favorites
1	A fascinating dramatic series... Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood... ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history... The ER (Season 2) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere "Welcome Back, Carter!" in which Carter arrives late for his new position in the ER while Mark gets comfortable in his new position among the senior staff. Meanwhile, the ER tries to patch up the victims of a rival gang war, and new medical school students arrive in the ER for their rotations... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include "Hell and High Water" in which Doug happens upon a young boy trapped in a drain pipe rapidly filling with water, and "A Shift in the Night" in which Mark is forced to carry the load of the ER by himself when Doug is out with whiplash and Susan is out on business... Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 2) DVD: Episode 27 (Welcome Back, Carter!) Episode 28 (Summer Run) Episode 29 (Do One, Teach One, Kill One) Episode 30 (What Life?) Episode 31 (And Baby Makes Two) Episode 32 (Days Like This) Episode 33 (Hell and High Water) Episode 34 (The Secret Sharer) Episode 35 (Home) Episode 36 (A Miracle Happens Here) Episode 37 (Dead of Winter) Episode 38 (True Lies) Episode 39 (It's Not Easy Being Greene) Episode 40 (The Right Thing) Episode 41 (Baby Shower) Episode 42 (The Healers) Episode 43 (The Match Game) Episode 44 (A Shift in the Night) Episode 45 (Fire in the Belly) Episode 46 (Fevers of Unknown Origin) Episode 47 (Take These Broken Wings) Episode 48 (John Carter, M.D.) The DVD Repor
1	I'm 3/4ths the DVD I used to be.... sing it, baby! I've been wondering how a 26-episode series could be completed with 4-episode installments. Now, in retrospect, it all seems sadly obvious. Just put only 3 episodes on each of the last 2 discs... and CHARGE THE SAME PRICE! [sound of metallic breathing] DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE!!! On the positive side, I guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the "Complex" variety and thus considerably advance the Laughing Man storyline. Don't get me wrong. This is a great chapter of Stand Alone Complex, highlighted by a scene in which the Laughing Man pulls someone's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire. If there's a weak part of this installment, it's the sequence with the "Armored Suit", which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first GITS film, just as the "Testation" episode had done several installments back. The armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect. By the end of this installment, almost the entire shape and design of the Laughing Man plot seems clear. It is interesting to learn from the special features that the Murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be stand-alone material
1	i never get tired of this one.... i saw OFM when it first came out, over ten years back. it was on cable the other day. it still keeps me glued to the set. bill paxton, billy bob thornton, michael beach....great work. too bad this one didn't get more media and a larger audience
1	Depp and Walken in real-time suspense Johnny Depp's character is coerced into in assassination plot by a corrupt government agent played by Christopher Walken. I like this movie. I think some of it is a little far fetched, but I like that it tries to tell the story in real time. It helps put you in the situation and adds to the suspense. And the situation is a tough one to get out of, with seemingly omniscient antagonists that deny his every attempt to free his captive daughter through means other than complying with their criminal demands. I think what appeals to me most is he's alone against the world and your right there with him. He's an ordinary guy put in an extroardinary situation, and the audience is taken along for the ride as he struggles to find a way
1	Not Another Teeny Bopper Movie This movie surprised me. I expected something like She's All That, one of the better teen movies (to me)...or maybe something less than that. But this movie was not what I expected. It was fresh and funny! It made references to John Cougar Mellancamp and the storyline was unusual, absurb, and it worked. Good comedy. Not on my top ten list, but worth a viewing, in my book
0	Help A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio. The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out. What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her... This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game. We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it. We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon. Thank you. Aussie Girls
0	Eh Bland, bland, and more bland. It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark. With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable. And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way. It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity
0	The Devil Bores Read-a and Moviego-a I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common. I can't say I really liked either. The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one. Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides. Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough. Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role. The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted.
1	Quite Possibly The Best PPV Ever Put On When I heard that ECW was coming back full-blown and in its entirety I knew I had to review the best ECW show ever put on, and without a doubt one of the best PPV's put on under WWE's name Lance Storm vs. Chris Jericho - One of the best openers I have ever seen, these two just mesh so well, and that's mader completely obvious when you watch this the two dropkick spots are great but the ending makes you feel like you've been cheated 8/10 Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri - Excellent way to follow up the opener there are spots galore in this m atch with the top one obviously being Crazy's balcony moonsault this match has a lot of run-in's but that doesn't hurt it that much 7/10 Psicosis vs. Rey Mysterio - I'm kind of in the middle on this match, as its nowhere near as good as some of the stuff they have put on before it is still a solid bout with a great legdrop spot Rey picks it up with the help of the 619 (boo) 6/10 Sabu vs. Rhyno - This starts right after RVD's heart-felt promo, this was a little bit of a let-down although Sabu can't be expected to do everything anymore, kinda feels slow and dragged-on even though it is only 7 minutes and that's never good, great finish 5/10 Eddie Guerrerro vs. Chris Benoit - Technical masterpiece, with both men using great ring psychology, only complaint is that just when it kicks into high gear it ends but that's one complaint over one great match 8/10 Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - WOW, is the only word that comes to mind when viewing this match, that and OUCH, it is just a spot-fest but what a brilliant spot-fest it is where the action never lets up for a second, withouty a doubt MOTN 10/10 Dudleyz vs. Sandman & Tommy Dreamer - this had to be on the card, although it is not my cup of tea, it is still a very good match, the teaming of Sandy and Dreamer works like a charm and creates some funny moments 6/10 All this action is capped off by the trashing of Eric Bischoff, so I do not know how it could have gotten any better, great climax to a great nigh
1	No Soldiers, No War This is a great movie that won Best Picture in 1987 and was acclaimed by both the public and the critic. Oliver Stone directs his first movie about Vietnam (the second was "Born on the Fourth of July", another great movie) telling his own experience about going to war. From the very beginning we can see everything about the military that they don't show when they recruiting (the ugly and painful true about the war). And the movie goes on an on until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts, doing drugs, killing randomly, even killing each other. This is waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. The movie is obviously rated R for violence, and there are some very tough scenes that make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill -among others- a mentally retarded (and of course harmless) young guy, and a woman. Then they set the village on fire, rape some women, and get away with it. The whole cast is excellent, specially Dafoe, who in my opinion nails his character. And the DVD comes with an excellent and terrific documentary called "Tour of the Inferno" (about 30 minutes long) about the film with Stone, Dafoe, Depp, etc. talking about the movie. There is also a commentary by Stone and a captain in there. This movie should be mandatory in all High Schools in America. If there were no soldiers, there would be no wars, and the war in Iraq looks a lot like the war in Vietnam. USA is making the same mistake again, and the government is so blind to see that (or maybe they don't care about the people, just about the business all the weapons' companies -Bush' frieds- are making out of it!). But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government. They always get their way. Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools. How can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools? Is that the education we really think our children deserve? That does not happen any other place in the world, not even in Cuba. Let's invest that money on education. REAL education. How many trilion dollars have Bush wasted in Iraq so far? How much money does the government invest on education? On health? For the people who live and work in America? Parents: teach your children. Nobody should join the Army. Let the politicians -real leaders, not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job, we'll see how many would go. Let the Commander in Chief go to war himself. There is no question about it: there would be no war. They wouldn't go. They would try to negotiate, and try to solve conflicts peacefully. Again, this is a GREAT movie everybody should watch. A masterpiece that is just not that, but also makes us think, and educates us. Everybody should ask themselves: war ... is it worth it? What for ...
1	Extremely Watchable I had my doubts, but it turns out this film experience can't be denied. It's formulaic, but also wiggy and raw and simply engrossing. Damn funny as well. The acting and dramatic elements are consistently strong, and there's no denying that Terrence Howard is an immensely talented and nuanced actor.
0	Say What....? ....the ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is....Reservior Dogs. This has great actors in it...I enjoyed seeing, f'instance, Dame Dunaway...but, she, Sinise, Dillon, Mantegna, and perpetual co-lister Faison had a poor dialog to work with. Imagine if QT had written it. Or, my favorite tough guy screenwriter, David Mamet. Fortunately though, Spacey will have something to build on develop a director's repertoire..
1	Worth it just for Mickey's Christmas Carol I would gladly pay the same price for just Mickey's Christmas Carol on the dvd. But, the other films are also special in their own right. Good classic Disney stuff here
1	I wish I could give this movie a 6 rating, it's the best theatrical biography I have ever seen! I loved everything about this movie. It captured the spirit of Gandhi's life, had a well developed plot, great characters, beautiful scenery, wonderful music and was a fine example of great drama. It didn't sensationalize Gandhi, his life, his impact on the world or rely on a lot of hollywood gimmicks for its strong visceral impact. This is the best theatrical biography I have ever seen and it is possibly my favorite movie of all time. It is truly inspirational and raises the bar for this type of movie considerably. In short, it is a masterpiece
0	It sucks, badly Really, the whole movie sucks. Let's start from the top, the plot. Now, as you probably know, the plot has nothing to do with the game, at all. In fact, the only thing remotely close they have is the name, and the BFG. The plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day, you know the drill. Nothing horribly bad, except for it doesn't follow the game at all. However, this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on Earth, and now Mars. Really. First, we have the Kid, who is horrible at everything, he talks while he's supposed to be stealthy, he gets high on mission, etc. Yes, it's his mission, but I thought this was an elite military team, not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training. And Portman, not only is a moron, but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he's saying. Now, as for genres. For a horror movie, it's not scary at all, not even a little suspense (though I kinda wanted the characters to die, so I guess that lost the suspense to me). For an action movie, well, simply put, there's little to know action, until the very end. And yes, there's a first person shooter sequence towards the end, but don;t be fooled, that is a gimmick and nothing more. Without spoiling anything,I'm just gonna say that the ending is incredibly generic. All in all, this movie is a waste of time and money.
1	LOTR I loved these movies, and watched the extended versions but preferred to purchase these ones because, i didnt read the books, so its just the movies for me, i think the extended version and extras are for book fans. Its A little weird that THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS doesnt have Spanish Subtitles but the other two did... i dont know why... but good collection, great story, good performances, amazing music, incredible scenes...
1	5 stars are not enough OMG - This DVD is fantastic! Disc 1 is not quite as good as disc 2 but that does not detract from how oustanding this set is. Lots of extras - some better than others. The time spent re-mastering everything was time well spent. The effort that went into this tour is mind boggling. A lot of times I just put it on and play it as background music - it even works as a 'Pink Floyd Greatest Hits' soundtrack. Sometimes my tastes do not coincide with those of my friends (e.g. Les Claypool DVD) but everyone I have played this DVD for wants their own copy. If you are a Pink Floyd fan - get it! You will not be disappointed.
0	fake "Dog Whisperer" - studious ignorance Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it. Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants. Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else. I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain
0	Meek Machine From the people who brought you "50 First Dates" comes this synthetic remake of the 1974 Burt Reynolds-Robert Aldrich crowdpleaser. Instead of a hard-edged prison population, we get caricatures and stereotypes. Adam Sandler is far more convincing as Happy Gilmore than Paul "The Wrecking" Crewe. Though a brilliant stand-up comedian, Chris Rock has yet to find his cinematic niche. The only bright spots are Reynolds (in the Michael Conrad role) and Courteney Cox
0	Don't waste your money This workout (or should I call it that) is composed of pieces of all different workouts put together. There is no class, no instructor, forget about cueing, no rhythm - it's horrible. The abs part is even worse. A kindergartener can do it. 5 day abs? Yeah right. I'm an advanced exerciser and this workout is a nightmare. Trust me - DO NOT waste your money
0	PLEASE MAKE IT END!!! There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this "movie" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is "touched" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more? The plot, the "humor," the dialogues, and the music are way beyond "below average." There is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film! As for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words... School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors! It is truly sad... Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk. You have been warned!
0	Absolutely awful! Enough already of this street-hustler, drug scene "coming of age" wannabes. It has been done much better in "Johns" and in Showtime's "Queer As Folk." Brendan Fehr's performance is an embarrassment. Cookie, who sends her brother out to get some sex, is beyond belief. This movie has nothing to recommend it. No stars is my rating. But, thanks, Amazon, for finding me a buyer of my DVD copy through my Marketplace selling account
1	BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION!!!!! Ghost Whisperer was the only show last season that I set aside time to watch each week. I thoroughly enjoyed each episode and can't wait to own the first season. Andrea's death was so very sad. I hope she'll be back for the occasional guest appearance, or should we say "ghost" appearance. Looking forward to each and every episode of the new season
1	legendary story brilliantly told the fable of Robin Hood is masterfully translated to the big screen. this 1938 version, of which there were myriad renditions, is deemed the absolute quintessential version. Errol Flynn is terrific as the outlaw Saxon. Olivia de Havilland delivers an equally stellar performance as the Lady Marian. filmed in georgeous early technicolor, this is a must for anyone's film library. as for the DVD, the picture is flawless and absolutley gorgeous in technicolor and the sound is excellent too. get this one!!
0	Hard people to like. The film has its amusing and even touching points, but not very many. The big problem with RH is that neither Ford or Benning are sympathetic characters. Henry is just the kind of self-important, ego-bloated, smug, arrogant, cold-blooded corporate ass that's helped step on working people for real, so it's really hard to feel anything for him, shot or not. He's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him, and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is, if you think about it, appalling. And his wife is, in a way, even worse; she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides. She goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up, and doesn't become "normal" ntil much later. Only their daughter has any heart at all. Maybe a better ending would've been Henry's not making it, Bening going nuts from losing her stuff, and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should've been from day one. Barely watchable.
1	Kids just love animals This video is a natural for a child. My daughter loves to watch the animals and has learned to recognize a variety of creatures from this DVD alone. I was thrilled to see they were limited to standard barnyard animals, and I love the upbeat music and the charming scenes! It always holds my daughter's attention and is great for soothing her from a bad mood, and also for thrilling her when she is already happy
0	Amazon.com likes to take my money this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me. this has happened about 4/5 times. While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do. sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work. If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave
0	I didn't like it... For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't. This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come. Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. "A Christmas Story" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers. Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of "odd fellow" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man). I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately. The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to "cling" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table. Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as. Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as "unhelpful" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?)
0	What a Letdown! I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better
1	A movie they would never make today! This is a great film. But, sadly, it would never be made today. I mean, try to imagine a film in which a 15 or 16 year of character has an abortion and it is taken as just another plot point. (Compare this to Crowe's Singles which brought back the oh so convienent miscarriage, like something out of a 1940's movie.) Also, imagine a film begin made today which invests so much time in developing its characters. Yep, you can't. So enjoy it for what it is, a window on a lost world.
0	Cheap Sopranos rip off falls way short I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation. It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it. The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent. Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family. This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later. Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.
1	Surrealistically Bizzare Though this was not the first modern horror film to use parody (Dawn of the Dead, An American Werewolf in London are examples), the lengths to which is goes are wildly imaginative. Just like Re-Animator spoofed the sci-fi/horror genre, Evil Dead 2 takes on the slasher film genre and sends it up way before the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer/Scary Movie cash cows. For those who liked the "tree" sequence in the first Evil Dead movie, imagine it being magnified over and over again. Using the stop motion animation technique in a deliberately crude fashion, Evil Dead 2 is still wildly imaginative. A person tries to fight off their own severed hand. Visions appear from nowhere. The first sequence in speeded up time is dizzily unnerving. If you don't like slasher films (believe me this is a hell of a lot better than any Friday the 13th film, take your pick) or if you're one of those old blue haired types ranting about "video nasties" then stay away. However, if you want a good, gorey and even sometimes scary descent into madness then Evil Dead 2 is for you. For real film fanatics, one might note (though on a far more intellectual level)the sense of the world collapsing and turning against the protagonist(s) of the film can also be found (albeit much more arty and far less gorey) in the films of Jan Svankmeyer. As for the casual horror buff, Evil Dead II is a classic of the subgenre of splatter films with a sense of humor which would be taken to new heights with Rob Zombie's "The Devil's Rejects". Leave the lights on

0	The worst subtitles awards goes to... I can't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd. This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. It's Kurasawa, after all. My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd. Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class. The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit. Alas, I was not; this was for real. Such a shame
1	Entertaining and Smart "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a remake of an older film I've never seen and stars the former James Bond, Pierce Brosnan as the title character. This is the perfect role for Brosnan, because he's better suited as a smart and sophisticated millionaire than an action hero. The movie is smart, plausible, entertaining, and the performances are very suave. As I said, Brosnan plays Thomas Crown; a millionaire who's life really isn't very fun...So, Crown decides to steal a painting from a museum that's worth 100 Million dollars. Crown, however, is not stealing the painting for what it's worth but merely for the excitement of doing it. The actual theft of the painting is really entertaining and pretty damned plausible. After he steals the painting, the cops begin investigating as well as an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), who's willing to do anything to find this painting. One thing Crown longs for (as it's explained in his therapy sessions) is a female equal to himself and Catherine has enough determination and smarts to fill that. Well, eventually Crown and Catherine begin an affair (and I must say, that for a woman in her forties Russo looks incredible) that appears to be only about sex. Neither one of them are entirely sure if they can trust one another. Comedian Denis Leary ('Rescue Me' & 'Jesus' Son') plays Michael, a detective working on the case along with Catherine. But, Brosnan and Russo really light up the screen. They play the characters better than anybody I could think of and they actually have charisma on screen, which makes it all the more better. This movie isn't a masterpiece but it is entertaining and exciting and worth watching. GRADE: A-
1	Wonderful I absolutely love this movie. Hanks and Ryan have so much chemistry together and the story is so adorable. I have watched this movie so many times and love it more every time!
0	This Star Does Not Shine So-So story about a man's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star's mother. Like that old Dickie Roberts movie, it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars, but does not do a good job of it. Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple, where are you when we need you?
0	One Last Dance I am sorry but I was unable to watch this product as it is not for Australian viewing which I did not realise or understand at the time. I have received a full refund for these goods but I would have rather been able to watch them. Thank you for your help and I wish I could have done your review - Iren
1	Bridget! I love this movie. Bridget has a way of embarrassing me and I am not even there with her! If you are a fan of "Pride and Prejudice" you will love this updated virgin on it. I laugh, I cried, and I am so happy I bought this DVD. The Special Features are true to fashion and can be more funny the the film. Well done, Brid! Well Done
0	BALKAN BULLCRAP Let's be up straight and honest. There is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie. Shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994, BALKAN RUNNER has a stiff and pondering script full of holes (like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix's claws?), a talentless cast, and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series. Daisy White is certainly lovely as is Isabel Russinova, but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga. Paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about, BALKAN RUNNER is one of those movies you've never heard about, and rightly so!!
1	What relationships and romance ought to be... This version of Jane Austen's Persuasion is an excellent example of the subtlety and warmth that is missing from modern, so-called romances. Anne and Wentworth are the two sane people surrounded by a range of wacky characters trying to distract them from what's really important. My husband and I are big fans of Jane Austen and this movie is one of our favorites, second only to the A&E five-hour version of Pride and Prejudice
0	rating of this movie This movie was not Bill Murray's best. I would not recommend it to anyone
1	True story Its kind of hard to base your opinion on this movie because its real life, there are a whole lot of kids in the world exactly like this, so if you like to see the life of kids in the real world i would watch this movie. Of course not every kid acts like tha
1	Sheer fun This is just a delight. There is sadness, but it is handled beautifully and believably. The voices are so well suited to the animation. On the second disk do not miss "Sid on Sid" that is hilarious. There is plenty of ice age information for those who are interested, for the rest of us this is just fu
0	What? I can't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got. The acting is laughable as is the writing. There are also many mistakes and inaccuracies! They depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys. Real life isn't like that. I guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up. But this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
0	I'll be there... but not for long There's a reason why they talk about the "Voice of an Angel" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut "I'll Be There" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so. Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl. The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps. "I'll Be There" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because "I'll Be There" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting. With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills. The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church. Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. "I'll Be There," but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can
0	watch you talking about willis? The story of the Strokes is the story of wealth and privilege, and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like Lou Reed and VU riffs. This was made without RCA, and so lacks strokes music. The band apparently wanted nothing to do with it, it is practically DIY, with no interviews. This just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project. Their 2nd album sucked anyway
1	Well done! Perhaps it was too long ago for anyone to have memories that could correct innaccuracies but few movies of the first world war seem to get it right. This one captures the American experience in that war like few others have. Drama and action together bring out a story of depth, courage, tolerance, and forbearance in the crucible of adversity. I watch it again and again. Hard to believe it was made for TV and not a major picture. Still one of the great war-stories to capture the American public.
0	Typical Wackness how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess. the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts. the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well.
1	Good Package Has all the Harry potters with their respective added materials, much cheaper than buying individually.
0	Another Gay HIV+ Demon Infects Another Innocent Wife (YAWN) Intensely homophobic, heterosexist, and hateful, this film represents the twisted fears and logic of the early panic stage of the disease in the 1980s. It was a time when the public was eager to pin the epidemic squarely on the shoulders of gay men, blaming antisocial "AIDS carriers" for carelessly or intentionally infecting chaste wives and innocent babies. It was a time when the public blamed AIDS on lust-driven, irresponsible gay men and cheating husbands. The film is pretentious and overbearing in its failed attempt to masquerade as a sophisticated inquiry into moral responsibility in the age of HIV. It reinforces the simplistic outdated idea that those who are infected with HIV can be neatly separated into the categories of "deserving" or "undeserving" - immoral monsters and their innocent victims sitting together on death row. Twenty years ago, perhaps this film would have its place as a document reflecting our social ignorance and failures in coping with a new epidemic. We did not know then that HIV was a predominantly heterosexual global pandemic. Today this film is a sophomoric attempt to assign blame and reinforce old prejudices about HIV and HIV+ people. Most importantly, HIV is no longer a death sentence to Americans who discover their status and enter medical treatment early. As someone who counsels and tests hundreds of people for HIV infection every year, I would not recommend this film to anyone seeking knowledge or entertainment
0	(2.5 Stars) His Best in Years But Still Needs Something More The title 'Wake of Death,' new film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is rightly given to the very violent contents. Van Damme plays a bouncer Ben Archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he doesn't want to see for 20 years. But he has a beautiful wife Cynthia (Lisa King, 'Home Alone 4') and a kid at home, and all he wants is just a quiet life. Anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted Cynthia (who is an INS officer by the way) takes home a little Chinese girl found among the refugees from China. And the little girl is connected with a Chinese triad, in fact, a daughter of a ruthless boss Sun Quan (Simon Yam, 'Tomb Raider 2'). And these events occur at the night when Cynthia and Ben are sleeping together in bed, showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room. [TYPICAL REVENGE STORY] Yes, Van Damme is getting more and more serious these days, as you have seen 'In Hell' recently. 'Wake of Death' goes similar course, but this time it's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases. Though the script is a standard one, one inventiveness is found in the relations between Van Damme's hero and his former associates French mafiosos. These French gangsters give a timely help or two to Van Damme's character in a more bloody fashion than the Italian guys who were seen helping Arnie in 'Eraser.' So how good is this film? It depends on your expectaions. 'Wake of Death' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs, but the lack of imagination on the director's side is too obvious. My opinion is, it is much better than 'Derailed' (his worst), far below 'Timecop' (arguably his best), on par with 'The Order.' But it's just my idea. The point is, Van Damme shows pretty good acting here, but the actions, or the logics behind them, look awfully disjointed. The bad guy's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained, and the relations between the characters are very confusing. (Case in point. You get a glimpse of two veteran actors Burt Kwouk, 'Cato' of 'Rerurn of Pink Panther' and Jacqui Chan, 'The World of Susie Wong,' but the moment they appear on the screen, they get killed, without leaving no impression on us.) But most damaging thing is the film's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall. I still do not know what happened at certain point of the story. Philip Martinez, formerly producer of B action films such as 'Dot Kill' or 'House of 9,' gives his second film as director. (Incidentally, his first feature was, the imdb says, 'Citizen Verdict'(03) starring Armand Assante and Jerry Springer!) As to 'Wake of Death' he decided to shoot this film in South Africa though the story is set in America. Fans of Van Damme might hail the film as his come-back. I don't know, for I still fondly remember joyful thrills when I watched his 'Timecop' or 'Universal Soldiers.' 'Wake of Death' is good as Grade-B, straight-to-video actioner, but it's not good enough for me.
1	did they misbehave? loved this movie~ rather refreshing to see 4 filmakers work on one film using tim roth as the bellhop who was just fabulous~ chapter 3 certainly threw me off guard :) its a keeper in the collection dark humor comedy
1	Love it; Great beginner yoga DVD When I decided to try yoga this was the first DVD that I purchased. It is fantastic. I have since bought another 3 of Ravi & Ana's DVDs, and several done by other people. The other choices do not come anywhere near the standard and style of Ravi & Ana. Thank you to them for making my discovery of yoga a true pleasure
1	Best one so far So far this is the best of the Ana Brett and Ravi Singh DVDs that we tried. Best production quality
0	Not good... Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised. Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan. However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch. While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful. As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else. But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..
1	One of John Wayne's Best Performances This post-war made film (1951) about WWII is rather retrospective and honest in its telling of the tale. Wayne is very good here in an uncomplicated role. Mixing, submarines, lurking enemy, and old flings or ex-flings with a lot of macho dialogue (without preaching) along the way, this film does not fail to entertain. George Waggner's direction give a lot of freedom to get his story across.
1	When things go wrong and one is in harm's way. This is a chilly saga of an American sub captain plagued by failure-prone weapons and an ocean full of Japanese to fight. They find the reason the torpedoes didn't work and put back to sea, this time, to take good care of the nasty business at hand. One scene that brings the cost of war home is that the Thunderfish loaned another sub a movie, &quot;Washington Slept Here.&quot; Sometime later, they find wreckage of an American sub, and the movie tells them who is at the bottom of the ocean. The Thunderfish strikes back at the sub that got their friends, showing how dangerous it was out there and what courage it took to fight this war. The climax scene shows them in a Japanese-controlled harbor, with a waiting task force. They fire their new and deadly torpedoes, and radio back to Cincpac about the taskforce and its location. They run for cover, and barely survive massive retaliation: the outcome is in doubt until the last, as it was for many other submariners. A moving, poignant, and bittersweet tale that stresses the fact that nothing ever comes for free, even in war
1	The Shopping Mall is filled with flesh-eating zombies. With the success of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), a must-see for every horror movie buff, George A. Romero, 11 years later, in 1979, made a sequel, DAWN OF THE DEAD (1979) in living color (and dead too). This time, he could really be bloody and gruesome. Francine (Gaylen Ross), and three military men Peter (Ken Foree), Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Stephen (David Emge) go to the Oxford Development Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania to kill hundreds of living dead zombies. Even zombies like J.C. Penny's. This movie was written, directed and edited by George A. Romero. He also appears in the technical booth with a scarf around him. All 130 stores cooperated for the filming. Tom Savini is "Pasquale Buba". He is also credited for make-up, cosmetic special effects and stuntman. He also appears in From Dusk 'Til Dawn (1996) and the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004). Shown in widescreen. Many extras. Audio commentary with George A. Romero and his wife Chris and Tom Savini. Best Line: "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth". said by Ken Foree (as "Peter"). Easter Egg #1: Click "Audio Set up", Push down to play. Push right button to resume to main menu and to...you made the zombie turn black. Press "Enter". Tom savini discusses practical jokes. Easter Egg #2: Click "Extras". Push right button or down button 8 times until zombie turns black. Chris Romero discusses how she met her future husband, George A. Romero. Followed by DAY OF THE DEAD (1985) LAND OF THE DEAD (2005) DIARY OF THE DEAD (2007) In 1990, George Romero returned to make his classic film with a new cast and in living color, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990), directed by Tom Savini, starring Tony Todd. In 2004, Director Zack Snyder came out with a remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004). So in 2005, Romero himself made a new sequel, LAND OF THE DEAD (2005). Director Steve Miner will do a remake of DAY OF THE DEAD (1985). It is set for release in 2007. George A. Romero wrote and will direct a new sequel, "DIARY OF THE DEAD" to also be released in 2007.
0	One of the worst movies I have ever seen. This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end. I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
1	An Absolutely Gorgeous Movie Watching Mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside. This may sound a bit cheesy, but the imagery in this movie is fascinating, and simply, just really fun to watch. Mirrormask it not a once-through movie, once you see it once, you want to see it again, the visuals are just too much for simply one go. And this is one of the great beauties of the movie: for all of the complex visual that it offers, the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet. Definitely a children's movie that really delivers
1	Charming and filled with fun and laughter In a world filled with headlines on war and hate, you and your family will enjoy these timeless classics that enthralls people of all ages (including men!). The beautiful poetic Anne captures our imagination and we can see a piece of ourselves in her with every step through her life journeys. Use these beautifully inspiring books to bring your family closer together and grab the attention of your children inspiring them to read other literature. This is a must read for anyone of any age!
1	The Best in the Breed When is comes to teacher/student dramas there isn't one better than 'Mr. Holland's Opus' for the main reason that it's believable. Most of the films in this vein get trashed by critics for creating perfect teachers, teachers that can do no wrong. Here, we get a glimpse into the life of a man whose intentions are all right but the outcome isn't always the best. He's a man who knows how to do one thing, and that one thing he does so well, but that one thing is also what pulls him away from the one's he loves the most. Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss in a career best) is an aspiring composer who takes up teaching music to help pay the bills. His wife (Glenne Headley) is supportive, yet when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child things change. Their relationship is tried as Glenn starts to pull away from his family due to the fact that having a child who can't share his love of music is killing him. Glenn is a very flawed man, but he has a very big heart and that's why this film works so well. When Glenn starts to fall in love with a student you don't hate him as much as you feel bad for him. He's far from a bad man, he's just a man. This is truly one of the most touching, inspirational and blessed movies I've ever seen. It's a film that will never get old with me and will bring a tear to my eyes every time I watch it. With brilliant performances by the entire cast and a very true to life feel to the script and to the performances you feel as though you know these people, and by the end of the film you'll want to. As ispirational as 2001's 'A Beautiful Mind' this film stands tall as one of the best films ever made
1	A great addition to any workout Both volumes provide a great addition to any cardio workout. What I like the most is it that you can choose which part of your body you want to focus on and go right to that section. It provides three approaches to each movement, easy, regular,and challening. These CD's should last several years at least. A great buy!

0	"Is this funny still? Yet? I honestly can't tell..." Seasons One, Two, Three: "Go Man, Go!" Season Four: the one to forego. Speaking as a fan who was first stupefied (amazed; astonished) by Bob and David back when they were the Kings of Megaphone Crooning ("People didn't want to hear songs about things that hadn't even been invented yet! They wanted to hear songs about NEW things."), that is, speaking as the rare fanatic, the rare "Mister Mr. Show" raising his voice on Amazon who laughs just as hard at the good G rated sketches as he does at the good NC-17 rated sketches, I find "Season Four" the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless MS sketches available in one package. Funnyguy Bob Odenkirk, reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life, says that Four was the season when "well-crafted" sketches were "in", "absurdity for absurdity's sake" was "out". No longer, he claims, was Mr. Show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers. Translation: they dumbed it down for the audience (and/or: horsing around in the writers' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat, facing the corner). Enticing as the term is, "well-crafted" here seems to mean "warmed over SNL type stuff", as in: spicing up the world's 1000th Jerry Springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat (momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is "funny" incongruity) and ladling on the same gay panic, the same class anxiety that makes the real Springer show such a howl. Overall, MS4's concepts become less novel, less thinky, less left-field-funny, with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true. What I mean is: a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor. But at least SGRH is a species of comedy. I haven't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies, and accounts for at least 75% of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts. Excelsior? (ex-cel-si-or (n.) Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing (originally a trademark)). This set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours. One, and only one, sketch makes me laugh out loud: the phenomenon of "Monster Parties" (as documented in novelty songs such as "Halloween Shindig", "Dracula's Pajama Party" and the like) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid TV grammar. Original, bent premise anchored by yet another simultaneously vicious and sympathetic David Cross performance. For the most part, the gang seems tired, like they're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny. Surely, anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass.
1	Blinds are like regulars, now. THIS IS THE ONE! The other DVD collections for seasons 1, 2 & 3 were pretty funny (OK...some of the funniest stuff of all time, especially "Druggachusetts," and "The Chip on the Shoulder Club") but THE FOURTH SEASON WAS WHEN IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. It doesn't get any better than the episode called "Show Me Your Weenis!" The first time I saw this, in 1998 when it first aired, I realized that this was the absolute pinnacle of intelligent, over-the-top American comedy. Surreal, sharp, better than any British zaniness, and full of bizarre ideas like "furniture for the blind" that lets you know where you are with pre-recorded celebrity voices; and the all-time greatest, "Wyckyd Scepter," which must be seen to be believed. Bob and Dave, you are SO naked! Better than Monty Python ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SO-CALLED "COMEDY" SERIES I CAN THINK OF. IF YOU GET ONLY ONE OF THE MR. SHOW DVD SETS, GET THIS ONE.
0	Awfully...*yawn* (Yup...it's that DC hating teen on her dad's account) Although GG is possibly one my favorite television series, I was disappointed with this one. Possibly NO character development, except maybe Lorelai. Jared Padalecki's annoyingly routine guest spots as married/in-denial/sleazball chump cheater Dean Forrester gets on my last nerve. I could smack Rory for sleeping with him, and ruining his fated marriage. Meanwhile, Lorelai becomes almost ditzy. Her relationship with Jason Stiles gets quite boring. She's totally oblivious to Luke's obvious infatuation with her. Emily and Richard's seperation is the best part...watching them bicker is funny. The end kiss with Luke/Lorelai is the best part. Otherwise...don't get it
1	One Amazing Night I was very fortunate to have been a volunteer at the Musicares Person of the Year Tribute to James Taylor on February 6, 2006. It was a spectacular evening filled with great music and a wonderful feeling. I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I am very much looking forward to it. If you're a fan, this is a must have. Stars performed James' music and talked about what his music and life's work has meant to each of them. I loved Sting's sweet and funny story about evaluating his own musical career prospects after seeing James play for the first time. Performers and set list included: Sweet Baby James - Paul Simon Shower the People - Dixie Chicks Secret of Life - India.Arie You Can Close Your Eyes - Sting Everybody Gets the Blues - Taj Mahal and Dr. John Country Road - Keith Urban Millworker - Bruce Springsteen You've got a Friend - Carole King (and James) Copperline, Shed a Little Light, Fire and Rain - James Sheryl Crow and Bonnie Raitt also performed, but I can't quite recall what. I'm sure you'll also get to see James interacting with his wife Caroline and two small sons who were there. They seem like a nice family. I had the chance to talk to them briefly and James is as kind and caring as you would imagine him to be. I loved this special evening and am grateful to have played a small part in it.
1	Gave me a new perspective on things as they are This was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all. It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore, but this movie gave me a new realization. That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info. If you think this might be too boring for your taste, give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish. Thank you Mr. Gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen
1	tyler perry goes to jail tyler perry is just plan funny. i have all his tapes now. this is not as good as diary of a mad black women, but is still definely worth seeing. my whole family loves them and watches them over and over. they medias family reunion is very funny. i will continue to collection all the tapes he puts out!! and the fact that he is a christian is even better. great comedy, and that is usually not my choice of dvd, but this is great humor. c
1	As Good as Season One--With More Twists--No Spoilers in This Review My son and I watch LOST together, one or two episodes at a time, on DVD to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on TV. After we finished Season One, we didn't think it would be possible for Season Two to match it. However, it did not disappoint. It's hard to write a review of LOST without throwing in spoilers, but I'm going to try to give the essence of Season Two without ruining any of the secrets. Season Two finds the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 uncovering more secrets about 'The Others'. There are additional characters. I won't say where they come from, but be prepared for a shock. Each LOST character carries personal baggage, has what might be called a tragic flaw, and in Season Two, these flaws begin to get larger on some and to be overcome by some. Also, some characters deviate from what makes them good and become almost bad. The writing and acting are outstanding. It never ceases to amaze me how much of the acting on LOST is not spoken. The characters give 80% of their communication and clues about themselves through the way they react before speaking, or their body language, even such little things as a raised eyebrow. This minimalist dialog requires great acting, and the LOST cast is one of the best. They certainly justify what must be a gargantuan payroll for the producers. There are more twists and turns on Season Two than Season One, which had to spend more time on character development. Be prepared to go back and see flashbacks from Season One in more detail, or from the angle of another person, and also be prepared for sequences that cross levels of consciousnes--some where you think the character is dreaming, but isn't, and some where you think the characters are acting, but are dreaming. Great color, sound, location, scripting, acting, suspense. Highly recommended. Five stars
0	Garbage for all seasons!! This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile
1	The War is Over but the Battle Lives On (WWE vs TNA)! The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews. I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD. They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW. I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info. Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection. I just wish they added more matches and interviews. TNA better watch themselves.
1	Family Dissolution, Lust for Power, Madness ... The story line is superb ... the scenery is stunning and gorgeous, vast mountains and green valleys, walled castles and fortresses. Hidetora, the aging warlord, holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside. He announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons. Only one son, the youngest, dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting, he predicts the same after the transfer of power. He believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy. The youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord. Hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons. He has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half, which they easily do. He gives them in succession, three arrows bundled together, representing the unity of the family, none can break the bundle. This is Hidetora's example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified. He envisions the House of Ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during Hidetora's own reign of power. In his anger, Hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes ... Yet Subarua, the youngest, holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass. Hidetora visits Taro's castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to Taro's wife, Sue'. They are forced to move out. Hidetora discovers after the transfer of power, he is no longer respected. Sue' married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war, a war in which her parents were murdered. She harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother, Jiro. Hidetora's court jester creates a mocking song about Taro being like a gourd, spinning this way and spinning that way, implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it. At a family gathering Taro hears the song and is outraged ... In a surprise move, Hidetora and his guards leave to visit Jiro. Hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either, not at all what he expected. He left abruptly ... The treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them. As predicted by Subaru, the younger brother, war is inevitable. Local chieftains must decide where their loyalties lie, which brother to support. Hidetora goes into hiding. Eventually he goes mad. His only guard and caregiver, the jester, does not leave his side. This film contains very strong battle scenes. The desire for control and power is the true motivator for both older brothers. Loosely based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this Japanese version is astonishing in scope and grandeur. The costumes and scenery are fabulous. In the film, there are tender moments between the jester and Hidetora. There are moving scenes where Jiro's wife escapes to find her brother who was blinded in a past conquest and lives alone in a cottage ... The producers and directors create a phenomenal ending and conclusion. At some point, Hidetora reawakens from his madness long enough to recognize the impact of his decision on his family and the near destruction of the kingdom he once ruled. The ending is climactic and leaves a major impression on the viewer. The film is amazing! Erika Borsos (erikab93
0	Bad Quality DVD The video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc. A standard 4.7GB disc, by the way; that's what you'll get when you buy this. I say this because I've used those programs before and know how they alter the video. This is how they alter it, and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD: Skin color is too red. Dark (shadowed) areas are greenish. White/beige is pinkish. Grey is bluish. White has blue on it. The colors are just totally messed up. Evidence of grey being blue = look at Robert Duvall's uniform (you'll see him 3 minutes into the movie). The german uniform is a semi-light grey. It is too dark and filled with blue. Then look behind him at the wall. A lovely dark shadow of green. Evidence of white/beige being pinkish, when Robert Duvall walks into that office, look at the walls. They should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all, they are pinkish. As he walks into the office to sit down, you see curtains on the wall in the office. They are supposed to be white, but they're filled with blue. At 48 minutes into the movie, you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly. His suit is supposed to be black. Look at it. It's purple. That is not black. On top of all that, the movie is too dark. There should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment. If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie, such as fixtures around a room or an office, most times, they are pitch black and indistinguished. For example, look at desk drawers, telephones, vases, black hair, black jackets..even Robert Duvall's eye patch. Not much shading, usually pitch black. I've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release. I plan to get the Region 2 (Europe) release. I'd rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better, "proper" quality. 'Nuff said
0	Definitive portrayal of generation X (for what that's worth) Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being? And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack). Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms. Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism. Is this film an accurate portrayal of them? Yes, in some ways. Is the film worth watching? Yeah, at least once. Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth. This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.
0	Brilliant Actings, Predictable Story! I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy
0	I wish I could have seen it! I was unable to view my DVD of Ballet Russes since the message on the screen said - not available in this area - or something like that. I have sent 3 Emails to Amazon to tell them I was unable to view it, and despite the fact they promise replies to Emails within 24 hours, I have heard nothing. So I am not happy at all. I will let you know how good the DVD is when you send me a copy I can view
1	Phenomenal! The best intro to Tai Chi and 'Internal Arts' "A fantastic four-hour DVD full of exercises, Qigong, meditation, and a short Yang style Tai Chi sequence done to the left and the right. It has simple to follow along to 20 minute, 40 minute or 60 minute Workouts, and a long, brilliant Instructional section with very detailed guidance through every movement, from basic to advanced. I followed along to the 20 minute version sitting down at first, and have worked up to the 40 minute standing. This program helps you to regain strength and overall health." A Viewe
1	One of the best!! I love this movie. For those who love romance, fantasy, knighthood, gallantry, and all that, this is your thing. One reason I love it is that Don Quixote must have read (!) the saying, "When you tell a man he is brave, you are helping him to become so." The Don, this mad-man, sees nothing but the beautiful and pure in the whore Aldonza, and despite her violent rejection of his view of her and the name "Dulcinea" that he gives her, she eventually realizes HIS purity of mind and begins to think maybe there is something worthwhile in her after all. Thus, she becomes, slowly, as he envisions her. That to me is thrilling. And, I heartily disagree with those reviewers who object to the voices of Peter O'Toole (dubbed) and Sophia Loren. Sure, they aren't the best, but taking the Don's for instance; if his voice had been any better, it would have been 'way out of character for the "Knight of the Woeful Countenance." And a Shirley Jones voice would not have been convincing for the whore Aldonza, to my way of thinking. To me, they were both perfect for their parts. Cummon, let's be realistic! If you want perfect voices, watch "Carousel" etc. This movie is inspirational, touching, exciting, and one I watch many times, getting a thrill out of it each time. Am ordering the DVD with captions, as I don't want to miss ONE word!
0	DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO BREAKDANCE!!! You Got Served was a horrible misrepresentation of what the b-boy scene is actually like and this instructional video pushes that misrepresentation even further. If you want to learn to breakdance buy the Breakdance step-by-step dvd released by bboy.org or any of the films in the Breakvision series
0	Kind of loses steam very quickly Even though it's used by a lot of reviewers, I have to use it too. The opening scene has John Travolta staring into the camera delivering a monologue about how Hollywood creates **** lately. He mentions that it would be great if the bad guy got away in the end, then later in the film he talks about Harry Houdini and misdirection. Oddly, this film was produced by Joel Silver, who I can list as a creator, or at least a deliverer, of said Hollywood ****. There's only 3 reasons really to watch this film, none of which have anything to do with the story, which shows you just how the film is. Stan is a talented hacker who's been down on his luck since being released from jail. Dead end job, unkempt trailer and denied rights to see his daughter. Well, an opportunity comes when a woman, Ginger, offers him money to meet with a man. That man, Gabriel, is incredibly wealthy and will pay him 10 million dollars to create a computer virus that'll net him near 10 billion dollars. Of course, it doesn't help that the feds are after both of them Those 3 reasons? Well, the first is an incredibly awesome looking shot where we get a 180 slow motion pan (it is NOT a full 360) after an explosion goes off and we see it's aftermath. While the full version of the X-Men Last Stand shot found in the special features looks better, this is just as great. The other is at the end where a helicopter flies a bus all over the city and smacking into buildings while the 3rd is of course a nude sunbathing Halle Berry which apparently she was paid a handsome sum of money for each breast shown. However, that's kind of where the good parts end. The biggest problem is that it's an action movie based on the lowest common denominator. It's super-stylized and sleek and has some pretty big sequences but that's it. Some action films like Die Hard inexplicably hold up on repeated viewings. Here, after the first watch, you've probably experienced all you're going to see. They add in the daughter subplot which isn't as developed as it should be but it did resonate with me. The film does have its fan but it's hard for me to like something so....plastic. Should you buy it? I doubt it, unless you want a show-off disc for your home theatre, something that other films do infinitely better
1	An observation of the taboo... with depth. Let's be honest. Sex is a fundamental aspect of all of our lives, yet most of us are really afraid to deal with it honestly. This movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way. Whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not, this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about, and it does it in a way that is quite frankly, non-sensational and non-gratuitous. And you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get' and enjoy this movie, for it goes much deeper. This is a excellent character study. The film is quite erotic, although very little actual sex is shown. It's power is in the anticipation and what is NOT said. It's about NEED. As several other reviewers have brought out here, there's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex. The beauty of the film is in it's subtlety and the depth of the characters, which the director takes time to develop. Both James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story, which really is a story about 'complements'. It's about finding that balance in the energy between two people. There is a silent, powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles. The viewer can really just 'sense' this dynamic building throughout the film. There is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes. There is so much that is unspoken, yet if you pay attention, you know what is going on. I think it's great film-making. In an age when we are innundated with quick, flash images every other second, sensational sex and violence for it's own sake, and a total LACK of character development, I find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters, and Secretary does that superbly. I also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental, open honesty. After all, in the end, its a LOVE story. A story of fufilled and satified needs on both ends of the equation. And really, isn't that what any successful relationship is really about? The look in Lee's face in the last frame of the movie says it all.
1	Ferris Bueller's Day off Perfect movie for everyone. No matter how many times I watch the movie it is always funny. Whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good.
1	Fade To Black... Karen Black (Burnt Offerings) burned herself into my memory w/ this 1975 TV anthology! For 30 years I remembered the Zuni fetish doll in the AMELIA segment, unable to recall much about the first two stories. Well, I just watched TOT again tonight, and I liked all three tales. While AMELIA is still my favorite, I found both JULIE and MILLICENT AND THERESE to be creepy and fun. Karen Black is a chameleon, changing from stuffy college professor- to evil murderess- to prim and proper prude to seductress, then terrified victim, and finally into savage huntress, all in under 80 minutes! Dan Curtis (Night Stalker, Night Strangler) allows Ms. Black to show off her talent for making the strangest material seem believable, while letting her carry the whole thing almost single-handed! This is one of those rare TV horror masterpieces that the 70s churned out. Like DUEL, NIGHT STALKER, THE DEAD DON'T DIE, etc., TRILOGY OF TERROR made it's mark. I'm glad to see it back on DVD...
1	As good as you remember it from all those years ago Another generation is now able to enjoy and learn
1	Princess Mononoke I have seen Princess Mononoke on T.V., and it rocks! It's just awesome like all the other movies that japanese guy makes
1	a true love brings maturity Beautiful. When the movie begins, the young lead character is a selfish, self-absorbed, lazy young man. He is looking for the quickest way to make money with the least effort...and like many of his peers, has an intense dislike for the refugee father and "son" who come to work with the company he is employed with. I mean, this fellow is just awful. He's so obnoxious, you keep waiting for him to do something appealing so you can stop wishing he'd fall off of the building. And then he does. He finds out, by accident, that the "son" is really a young woman. And he is immediately drawn to her. Suddenly, instead of being the tormentor he is the protector, of her physically and of her secret. When events transpire that lead him to search for her(well, I can't give EVERYTHING away, now can I?), we get to see the maturation process in action. Caring for someone other than himself gives him a strength and a resolve that even he did not know he had and brings him to an incredible sacrifice to help out her family. Iranian films rarely have what we would traditionally call "happy endings". Those are rare and not sought after. But there are endings that aren't horrid, just sort of sad, in a good way. It's hard to explain, but this film supplies an excellent example. In Iran, princes don't rescue the princesses, they usually get mangled by the dragon, but it's never a dull ride(and in this case he doesn't actually get mangled...).
0	Did I miss something here? I am a great fan of Bernstein's "Candide". I saw the 1974 production twice. My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once. This DVD should have been an excellent performance. Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible. Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image. I assumed it was a really bad recording job. Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy?
0	What a horrible Butcher Job of a Masterpiece!!!!! So there I was......browsing through Amazon.com and on "the page I made" up pops, guess what? Triumph of the Nerds on DVD. Seeing this, I was just reaching for my credit card to snap up a copy of it when BAM! I read one of the reviews...... Still a great show, but the Ambrose edition is not complete!, October 28, 2004 Reviewer: Sean Breazeal (Mt. Pleasant, UT USA) I immediately checked with Bob, and Yes, sure enough, several minutes had been cut from the original US release for "space" requirements. In his defense, Bob had no input on this. Were it me? I'd be hopping mad. Instead of the publisher, Ambrose, using this opportunity to create a new and valuable product by adding deleted scenes, extended version, and extras, they chose to go on the cheap and cut to fit rather than make a product worth purchasing. Bob Cringely is a genius and is thorough in all he does. Had they used this chance to extend what was probably the best compilation of the modern 'net age and add what I'm sure was hours of extra content Bob had to cut, I'd have been the first guy willing to pay retail to buy it. Having purchased 3 copies of the boxed video set (1 lost to a fire, 1 lost to a non-returning friend) there would have been NO hesitation to this. In fact, I'd have watched it straight through on receipt. What a HORRIBLE, horrible mistake Ambrose has made. FIX IT!!!! Don't walk, RUN from this edition. I know it's Old school, but do yourself a favor and buy the video tape version. You'll thank me later
1	The darker side of comedy BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types. And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive. The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue. One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male. The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing. A lovely film full of surprises
0	Can We Be Proud That We Are American's For Once The film Why We Fight, I believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize America. I felt that the movie, only told one side of the argument, and that side was clearly not pro-America. The film portrays the United States as a power hungry nation, which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world. The film constantly criticizes the decisions of America leaders to engage into foreign combat. The film however, does not present an alternative solution. It fails to take into consideration that America may be acting out of self defense. The film constantly criticizes America for engaging in combat throughout the world. What I have to say to the director of this film is: Is it not alright to defend your nation, after terrorist drive planes into two buildings, killing 3,000 people? Is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots, who are looking to destroy your way of life? Is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the Middle East, by toppling a murderous dictator? When I see these questions, I have to answer no to all of them. I feel that if America feels threatened, it should not have to seek permission to defend itself. President Bush put it properly I feel when he stated "After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers," and "America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people." This film can criticize America and label it as a bully nation, but these terrorist must be brought to justice. President Eisenhower once said, "Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin." As the most powerful nation in the world, it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world. It is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as Americans, sometimes take for granted. Since when, has it become wrong to defend your nation. Why must America be criticized for engaging in conflict, when it feels threatened? Is it not the job of the President of the United States to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent? Does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack America again, if they are given the chance? We can never let our guard down. Freedom does not come free. On September 11, 2001 we saw firsthand how evil, those who want to destroy us can be. You can not negotiate with these types of people. The only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force. On the morning of the September 11, 2001 attacks, President Bush stated that "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended." Indeed freedom was and is being defended, and I see nothing wrong with that. Words are not enough to protect our nation. President Theodore Roosevelt said, "Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all mankind," and our great action, will be to defend this great nation. In the words of President Hoover, "Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity," and it is America's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom. Remember: "Words without actions are the assassins of idealism." Herbert Hoove
0	Hard to keep up with I would not recommend this video and wonder why it got so high reviews from other people. The pace is way too fast and they change positions very often. It was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult. I couldn't imagine how kids could. The kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync. I would recommend "Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids" by Rich Grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun
0	Had to Turn It Off I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest. The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene. They also loved "The RM". If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it
1	Great chick flick This was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I decided to buy it for a girls night out. It went over very well. I even watched it with my husband, who found it very entertaining. Extra features on the DVD are interesting, but don't add a whole lot to the film itself
1	Heartbreaking I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen
1	Great DVD for aspiring cheerleaders. I am a former cheerleader and cheerleading coach and really enjoy this DVD. I bought it for my young daughter and loaned it out to some of my cheerleaders when coaching. It teaches the basics: the motions and what they're called, some cheers and chants, and one really fun dance routine. It also goes a little bit into what it means to be a cheerleader for your school and what will be expected of you and the code of conduct that you'll be expected to follow. It does NOT go into jumps or stunting at all. The stunting is definitely something cheerleaders don't want to learn from a DVD, but I was disappointed that they didn't teach any jumps. Another reviewer somewhere else, a former cheerleader, gave this DVD low marks because she expected to get a good workout from it and relive the good-old-days. Let me just point out to everyone, this is an instructional DVD for beginners. It's not a workout DVD and it's not for cheerleaders that already have a lot of cheer experience. Also, the organization that put this DVD together is the UCA, one of the biggest cheer-instruction organizations out there. They've been conducting cheer clinics all over the country for many years. Other cheer organizations do some motions differently or have different names for them. There is no right or wrong way, but aspiring cheerleaders should know this in case they make it on a squad coached by someone trained by one of the other groups. Always follow your coach's instructions and don't challenge him or her with these differences. One more word of advice for aspiring cheerleaders: unless you live in a very rural, small town with a small student population and are sure there won't be much competition at try-outs, TAKE GYMNASTIC CLASSES. Cheerleading has become very athletic and competitive. To increase your chances in the more populated areas, you will need tumbling skills. Dance classes - especially hip-hop - wouldn't hurt either. Yoga - to increase balance and flexability - would help a lot, too. Good luck
0	An Interesting Misfire Lord knows the media is a worthy target for social commentary. However, it is also an easy one, and has been often targeted in the past. Thus the central problem with "Mad City," Costa-Gavras' updating of Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole." The film spends nearly two hours denouncing the media---namely print and television news---for a variety of social ills, for not all of which it can so easily be blamed. And those things it can be blamed for, we kind of already knew. Nonetheless, an excellent cast works hard to bring off this story of reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman), who `lucks into' an exclusive when a disgruntled, laid-off security guard (John Travolta) takes his former employer and a group of kids hostage in a museum while Brackett just happens to be in the bathroom. Travolta is to be commended for taking on a part that is not particularly sympathetic, in the form of a character that is not very bright. He and Hoffman carry the film as far as it can go, but by the end you are likely to feel that you're being hit over the head with the simplistic central message, such that the tragic coda loses impact. It's not a bad film, and with these talents it can't help but have its moments, but overall it's a bit of a missed shot
1	fun for me - not for others? This movie was made for anyone who ever went to summer camp. It takes all the ridiculous things that happen and exaggerate them about 6842673 times. I personally enjoyed it thoroughly, but for those of you who DON'T spend 6 weeks out of your summer at camp, it might not be as appealing
1	review of a very funny video I had seen this video some while past and was looking to let a fried enjoy this humor,the video is super funny and quite well directed for such a different type of entertainment,this is a must see for all of billy bob lovers,get lost in the country for a couple of hours. This movie will entertain all Medical Marijuana advacates as well as show the value of the statement [legalize and tax it ] hope you like it as much as myself and a few chosen friends at a gathering of like minded peopl
1	National Treasure This is a very enteraining movie and really enjoyed all of the intrigue that it had and the good ending
1	Well Made Movie I first watched Friday on VH1 and on Comedy Central, both however were edited, the DVD allowed me to see more of the Movie, I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining movie
0	Disappointed- I bought this video for my 2 1/2 year old because he is very interested in the alphabet. The dvd was a huge disappointment because it didn't deal with letters but focused on rhyming words, etc. Not suitable for my son's age, boring and short. They sing a 60 second song with the alphabet that is an extra feature and that was the only thing he liked. Not a good buy
0	I wish I could go lower than this. This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny.
0	Not to be mean But there's a true absence of a development Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process. Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series
0	Sorry I bought this This DVD is very cheesy and I am sorry I bought it.
1	Enough twists to keep you entertained While not on the level of "The Interpreter" in terms of plot depth and character development, "Cellular" delivers what it says it will: a fast paced, tense thriller that will please most people. The plot is complex enough to keep the watcher guessing what exactly will happen and not bore the audience. There are a number of tense scenes that add to the overall suspense and thrill of the movie. If you're in the mood for a fast paced thriller this will not disapoint you.
1	Great Set A Must Buy for Fans Excellent even more than the average DVD films success! with miles of bonus content and footage. Plus commentary and bonus features for children and the family to enjoy for all ages. If i was to give a chritsmas gift this would be one to remember
0	W.T.F? This movie does not make sense. And it's not weird in the style of David Lynch, it's just complete crap. I thought Willie Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was the worst/stupidest fil ever until i saw this. Do not buy this. It is not a family movie, and it is not funny or entertaining
0	Chick Flick Hell *Warning: Spoiler* I cannot believe people, excuse me, some women are giving this movie four and five stars. Interesting premise,and it could have been a good, believeable movie-- but it was sooo syrupy. If this is what it's like to be in love, please somebody shoot me(note: I've been in real love for 27 years now.) I got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end. Why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a "good movie"? I felt like I was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over. Wouldn't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out? That, at least, would have made the movie more intriquing, believeable and redeeming. If ever a movie was made to force tears, this is it. This movie stinks and I don't mind telling you so--and it's not just because I'm a man either. Imo, there's not much difference between this movie and a stupid, blatant Steven Segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it's the elixir of heaven. Same coin, different sides. The movie should be given a "one"--no a "negative one" just for the stupid ending, but other redeeming factors make it a "two." Still not worth seeing--i.e., unless you're into infuriating yourself. ** Note: Even my wife and daughter--both chick-flick connousiours--hate this movie.I haven't checked yet, but I think my dogs do too.** Another note: These two good actors needed a better movie. See Ryan in the superb "Courage Under Fire", or the Jim Morrison movie, or "When Harry Met Sally"--which I don't categorize as a "chick flick" but as a good romantic comedy,i.e., not contrived
0	Spielbergs' worst? Well, it didn't appeal to me personally -the story, the characters, no, usually I am such a big fan of Steven Spielbergs' various masterpieces, and despite "Always" I'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies, and so well. Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindlers' List, Minority Report -you name it! The man is a genious, no argue there -but this movie simply hasn't got the touch nor the style
1	a valuable documentary To me, this film is worth owning, not just renting to see once. One only wishes it could be updated continually, especially to include 2005's Brokeback Mountain. However, it has so many gems that I recommend it for gathering so much history together
1	The funnyiest satir ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you love sick ghetto humor this is your show. It's like an mixture of Southpark, Family guy, Stand up comedys (like Eddy Murphys Raw etc) see it and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Perhaps the Most Overrated Film Ever I've seen this several times over the years and still can't make sense of why it's such a favorite. The acting is subpar, the drama cheesy and in my opinion as an active duty sailor, fails quite miserably to capture the true spirit of being in the Navy. To think that lunatic Tom Cruise practically built a career off of this garbage...sigh..
0	very stagnant I like Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool a lot. I think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie. But Under the Sand is a very typical French movie which makes most people don't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a French movie. I finally persuaded my husband that Francois Ozon is different and this movie will be good, it turned out to be a nightmare, pointlessly soul strangeling movie. I would not recommend unless you are a big fun of Ozon or this type of movies
0	Lackluster and sometimes inaccurate NOVA isn't what it used to be. The BBC Series "The Planets" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people
1	Top notch entertainment I could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about. Or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film, and find out that way. Most of you probably know it by now, as it is. A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a "blockbuster" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a "blockbuster". But it's also a damn good story, as mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous "You can't handle the truth...." line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this. And even though this movie is over two hours, I was never once bored....you won't be either
0	so bad it scared me out of eating i watched troll 2 on showtime beyond(showtime's horror/sci-fi movie channel) and like the movie itself is SO bad it's laughable! i mean the part where joshua screams out "your a genius big sister" nearly made me fall out of my chair laughing the movie takes place in a small town where EVERYONE is a vegan and like the religous people there have a phobia towards those who eat meat and they are "unpure" if they eat it which ironically saves johusa in the movie by eating a double decker sandwich with meat the goblins in this movie ARE creepy esspeically the one with the bolding eyes EEK! anyway thoughout the flim joshua is looking at pictures of CREEPY looking trolls which is ironic considering it's golibins anyway in the movie the only way for the golibins to eat is for someone to eat something so they could eat them! i'm not a child but that still is a scary thought! after watching this movie i didn't look at green and red the same way again nor could i eat much only watch this movie if you are looking for a laugh
0	Back to the future... of impossible romance? If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie
0	Now a longer version of a movie that was too long? OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story. The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters. The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!? Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
0	Definitely not one of Arnold's best... Eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention, but overall the movie displayed poor acting, stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot. This movie possibly will be owned by many, but remembered by few. James Caan was the only talent that Eraser has to offer. Sorry guys, my wife bought it, I watched it, gave it away and divorced her
1	"Can Anyone Play?" First off I agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie. When Denise Richards sees Matt Dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like, "Is this just a game for the boys, or can anyone play?" She looks so sweet and hot that it's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later. However she pulls ift off pretty well. In fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well. I couldn't understand why Kevin Bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual, but that was actually pretty good acting....I can't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists, but it's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing. I give it 5 stars because it's both fun and funny, and of course very hot at times. Well worth a look...
1	absolutely amazing The most amazing portrayal of the Anne Frank story that I have ever seen. Keep a box (or two) of tissues with you and prepare to cry buckets of tears
1	A landmark film! This surrealist picture is a magical mysterious tour around a bizarre world where the emotions have been lessened for the social conventionalisms, the double moral, the frivolity, epidemical visions, unresolved gilts, an easy going approach that do not seem to be so far of Rabelais or Moliere. One of the freest films in any age and a milestone reference picture. Another sublime artistic feat of Federico Fellini; these dilemmas, far from being diminishing, have been growing up, what it proves its magisterial precognition and penetrating sights in the social body. A must see!
1	One of the Best!! This was the third Anime series i had ever seen. The first was Cowboy Bebop, then Outlaw Star. With that in mind, realize that i saw this entire series on ONE sunday afternoon-night. This was the first "giant robot" series i had ever seen. I was VERRRRRRRRRRRRY dissapointed with the ending and have not seen the movies yet, but i still really enjoyed the show. This series offers emotional reaction that i had not felt from any other show or movie in years... This collection at such a low price is an absolute value, my only advice is to skip most of the 5th or 6th? disc and watch the directors versions of the last 4 or 5 episodes on the last disc instead
1	A great leadership movie As an Active Duty Air Force Officer, this has to be by far the best leadership movie ever for newly commissioned Officers and NCO's.
1	25 Words or Less Engaging Characters, Interesting Plots, Decent Writing/Translating, Fabulous Animation, Great Music (opening song is in russian, english, and latin). And Tachikomas! There! 20 Words! You don't have to be a fanatic (or "otaku" as we otaku like to say) about this stuff to like it. A word about the Tachikomas: they are tank robots the size of a VW bug and designed like spiders, and they are definately with the "Good Guys". They can even shoot "silk" and cling to the sides of buildings. And they sound (and frequently act) like children. You would never think of saying a robot that looks like a spider was *cute*, but the Tachis'll win you over
1	PLEASE STOP THE CRYING ALREADY :- (......... I really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc. I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length. The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film kids! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well. I think the remake is incredible.....is it better than the original? In some ways yes! in some ways no! Thats the way it goes! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone's movie collection! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-)
1	Excellent Technicality I heard many mixed opinions about this DVD but I'm glad that I finally decided to buy one for myself. Lang Lang's fingers are like flying upon the piano. His facial expression may seem distracting but I take it nothing more than an artist's expression of his own enjoyment in the music. Great music! not to be missed. I do hope to see more of his DVDs coming.
1	Good but flawed Spielberg "Munich" is not one of Steven Spielberg's best films,but it is still worth watching due mainly to a brilliant cast.Eric Bana,Geoffrey Rush, and Daniel Craig are especially outstanding.The film also has an impressive physical production and a haunting John Williams score. But there are problems.For one thing,it's too long.That seems to be a problem many directors have today.Why do all of today's big movies have to run nearly three hours?Spielberg could have cut half an hour,and the film would have been much better.But the biggest problem is that Spielberg,Kushner,and Roth have really stacked the deck for Israel here. The story is entirely one-sided.There is an excellent scene where the Arab and Israeli agents confront each other,and the three filmmakers would have been wise to pursue that angle.Instead,no explanation is given to the Arabs'side or to WHY they seized the athletes in the first place.The result is a decidedly unbalalnced story.And the ending is ambiguous.Still, "Munich" is an ambitious film worth watching
1	i so loved this movie so much! This movie is so comforting to me. Its sweet, funny and def. gives you a message. No matter how green the grass may seem (A man that has a lot on his plate: Kevin Bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman) it's not always. moral of the story is you need to go with your heart. He realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his "single self" I absolutely love this movie. love the music, love the actors, love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby. too funny! :)
0	Collateral It's amazing just how quickly I decided this movie really sucks. A music video without the music! For the USA Today, MTV, no attention span generation! With exclamation points! However, just to be fair and because I had nothing better to do, I endured 20 minutes. Give me a medal! Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair. Jamie Foxx's talents are wasted here. It's writing like this that makes us realize that Aaron Spelling was much better than we gave him credit for.
0	A disappointment in a way... For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon

0	HuH? This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it left me just feeling sad that I spent money to buy it. The characters are predictable, the plot is predictable.. well, I should have seen it coming. However, there are a couple of funny moments. That's why I give this movie one star
0	THE MIRACLE OF ... WHAT? This is my first time in this forum I've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLE AS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist. I choose the first option. Are you so kind -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ? Yours R
0	don't be &quot;con&quot; vinced into watching this To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
1	low tech, high intrigue jackal old fashioned political/spy thriller from the cold war era. head and shoulders above bruce willis '90s re-make without the over the top violence and weaponry. somewhat dated, but characters are well defined and beleivable and the single shot rifle disguised as a crutch, i want one!. this jackal is cold-blodded, ruthless and real
1	An interesting look at the Broadway wet dream This musical is about wanting to get out of the life you live. In the case of Shirley Maclaine's character, it's about her finally trying to stop compromising on her ideals of love and quit her hypocritical( hypocritical considering her remarks about truly believing in love) job as a dancehall hostess. In addition to conversely demonstrating the shallow nature of the Broadway musical dream and how even love can seem insincere on a grand lofty scale, they also inject these ideas with quirky humor which distracts from just how insipid these characters would seem if played straight. The funny thing about this film is that it is both a satire and completely honest in it's depiction of life. It also contains excellent choreography and music whose flash demonstrates the appeal of such things. Depicting all of these differing and seemingly contradictory thoughts makes the viewer not know how they feel about the whole thing. Personally, after the film was over I was left with the callow sense of whimsy and was amazed at how willing I was to be entertained by this. Apparently the stage version has a different ending so I hope that at some point I'll be able to see it
0	Pretty, but vacant. Immortel (ad vitam) (Enki Bilal, 2004) While I was not overly impressed with Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy on the page, I figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride, and with Bilal himself at the helm, I had high hopes for it. Most of them, unfortunately, were dashed in the first few minutes. The one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice. And it does-- some of the CGI faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the Final Fantasy film. And the integration of actual actors and CGI characters is often seamless. The "sets," though, are second-rate Bladerunner wannabes. There was a lot of potential in them, and most of it was wasted. The acting, even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent (Charlotte Rampling, for example), is atrocious. The two main actors, Linda Hardy (who, aside from this, has yet to land a major role) and Thomas Kretschmann (soon to be seen in the film adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy) are both wooden. Rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then, but it's not nearly enough. The plot is... well, I can definitively say there is a plot. And that it is, in fact, connected to the Nikopol Trilogy in some way. But when you don't meet the character of Nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film, that should tip you off that things aren't staying completely faithful to the book. There are scenes you'll recognize, if you've read the Nikopol Trilogy, but I can tell you from experience: having read it does not make this movie any more lucid. In fact, it may add to the confusion. In short, aside from the visually appealing aspect, I can't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to, well, anyone.
1	abouut the movie lionheart....... The story basically talks about Van Damme running away from army work to hekp his brother's family to overcome financially after his bother was killed by some 'gansters' or something. He earn his income throught some underground fighting which he later give to his brother's wife(if I've not forgotten the story). They are good numbers of action fighting scenes which I could say is a remarkable effort put into this movie/film. The only problem is that this movie/film is using indication of knife which is rather unsuitable for kids (that type of thing, the 'bear' issue or this..chinese) to watch. A very good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film.....Enjoy....

1	Hilarious This movie is HILARIOUS. It is Jennifer Aniston's best movie to date. She normally bombs in every movie IMO, but here is the perfect role for her. Ben stiller is SO funny as Ruben. The bathroom scene had me in tears I laughed so hard
1	Rule of Law determines whether a Soldier is a barbarous or civilized Defense argued, "Law does not exist in the Confederate prison. Therefore, the Raiders are not guilty of breaking any law", "these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive", "only rebel law applies in the prison". Outcries from other Union soldiers were heard, "we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics. What about us?" Prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men: 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft. The military jury found the six Raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging. The union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized. Mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft; however, once intolerance levels are hit, a violent revolution transpires. The raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial. However, the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the Raiders. The "Great Escape" with McQueen probably took its plot from Andersonville. The story line had a ton of similarities. Andersonville has a fair share of violence. At one point the directors portrays the prisoners as Zoombies, in the land, of the walking dead. Scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness, in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy, abhorrence of the injustices, and despair of the troops. Heroism abounds, leaders reject traitorous offers to defect, form their regiment, about face, and march away from on looking Confederate Admiral making offer. Factually, 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation, disease, and crime. Inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water, over crowding of the prisoners, no prisoner exchange, and looting. Andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value, as a civil war movie. The characters were passionate, compelling, and captivating.
1	Superb documentary What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void. The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it. Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.
1	Love Triangle - Civil War Style Just who will hot New York fashion designer Melanie Carmichael (aka Melanie Smooter) choose? Her heart is torn like a north and south divide between first husband Jake in Alabama and fiance Andrew, the JFK-like son of Manhattan's mayor who plans to groom her son to Presidental status. After Andrew proposes Melanie must rush through a divorce with Jake only to find that after 7 years of running away, she is still a Southern Belle at heart. Melanie's torn heart is like a civil war clash as her accent changes back and forth to reflect her inner turnoil and personality identity confusion. Just who is she? She wonders as her marriage preparations are underway. Is she the chick New York fashion designer who creates clothes that are picked up my high-end retail stores all over the country? Is she the Manhattan socialite who has nabbed the most elibible bachelor in town? Or is she a southern belle confederate sweetheart still in love with her first love? Is she really truly just Melanie Smooter Perry who inspired Jake to make something of himself when she left after a miscarrage? The only way to know is to watch her walk down the aisle a second time
1	About man's goodness in the face of adversity Kurosawa's magnificent homage to the poor and suffering in the world. Set in a rural health clinic in the 1800s, Toshiro Mifune plays the kindly but dictatorial head doctor, and Yuzo Kayama is a young, selfish, and self-centered intern who comes reluctantly to the clinic and learns humility. Through magnificent acting and superior direction, the movie captures the heart-rending trials and tribulations of these peasant people. Three "stories" predominate: a totally selfless man's death-bed cenfession about his wife and his loyalty to her; a 12-year-old girl's learning that there are good people in the world; and a 7-year-old boy's family who takes poison rather than starve any longer. There is a haunting scene where women are "calling back" the life of a boy from a well, according to a folk belief. At three hours the movie is perhaps a tad too long, but it's fair to say we don't lose interest for a minute. Kurosawa called this "a monument to the goodness in man." Indeed. Definitely worth a watch
1	no title Kingsley surely deserved another best supporting actor Oscar, and Fishburne was wonderful as always. A really super flic. Zallian scripted the terrific "Awakenings" with Robert De Niro
1	interesting, thought provoking film The previews for this film caught my attention, so I rented it as soon as it came out. It was a very interesting and thought provoking film. How would three people with different languages and different cultures interact, especially if two of them are enemies? This film explores that question. The performances were outstanding, and the film was beautifully and artisticly done. Much of it was very funny, as the audience is let in on both what WAS being said and what was THOUGHT to be being said. One example of this is Ivan being called Gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling Veiko to get lost. Even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating. While this film is rated PG-13, parents of older teens ought to preview it separately so as to make an informed decision as to whether they want their older teens to see it (I wouldn't). This is because of some issues of religion and morality (to say more would give to many plot spoilers).
1	It happened and is " Still Happening" The truth hurts. While it hurts, it is also much harder to swallow. These are issues that require consumption by everyone
0	Such a sad way to end the series... I fell in love with the Anne of Green Gables series when someone loaned us the first movie. I immediately went out and bought the books and found the 2nd movie that Sullivan made. The first two movies were outstanding and did an excellent job of telling Montgomery's story of Anne. Like many other fans of Anne, I anxiously awaited the third movie, hoping to see the marriage of Anne and Gilbert and the beginning of their married life and the starting of their family. There is wonderful drama in the books of this period of their lives. I thought, too, that a final movie would be very successful if it dealt with the wartime drama situated around Anne & Gilbert's oldest daughter, Rilla. What Sullivan presented, however, after two wonderful movies, was not only a desecration of Montgomery's writings, but also just a bad movie. If you have recently discovered Anne of Green Gables and love these tremendous stories, I strongly recommend that you buy the first two movies. By staying close to the text, Sullivan managed to deliver two incredible movies, and Meegan Follows is simply incredible. Based upon Sullivan's commentary's in the movies, however, we should consider ourselves lucky he got these movies right, because he really doesn't seem to "get" what makes Montgomery's stories so wonderful. This is even more apparent with the 3rd movie, which I can only guess Sullivan put out there to try and make some extra money. First of all, it has nothing to do with Montgomery's actual stories. Sullivan should have kept to directing and left story telling to Montgomery. Second, the movie is just bad. It was a couple of hours that, unfortunately, I'll never get back again. As other reviewers have commented, I own the first two movies and love to watch them with my family. They are *perfect* family movies with incredible stories and superb acting. The last movie shouldn't even be considered part of the story. It's bad. Don't waste any money on it
1	'70s Noir This is a relatively unknown film noir from the mid '70s, starring Gene Hackman as a former football player turned private eye who is obsessed by a chess game from the '20s, where one of the players missed a forced mate, and lost instead. He's hired by a wealthy former hollywood starlet to track down her daughter, which takes him to some of the seedier parts of the Florida Keys you'll ever see on film. As is common in other noirs, just about everyone in this film is corrupt, even including Hackman's character himself, to a certain point. As noted by another reviewer, this movie will remind many of 'Chinatown'. In the end, just about everyone loses. I have a copy of this on VHS, and I bought the DVD for the widescreen. I was impressed by the image quality of the DVD -- it's a little grainy, but overall, quite high quality. I don't think anyone's going to be very disappointed by the transfer, considering it's a mid '70s film. The only extras are some trailers, and a sort of short documentary on the director. Hackman is terrific in this, as he is in most of his other films. He can play genial one moment, and a moment later play cynical and tough. It's too bad he didn't get another opportunity at another role like this. Unfortunately, they don't really make films like this anymore
0	Horrible Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful
0	Cheap Switcheroo... Originally placed the order for the non-Thinpak release as Amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the "new" slimline Thinpak. Seems MGM decided not to release this box set in the original style; annoying to say the least. They've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style. SG-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases (Season 9 & 10)?? This is not unlike the Simpson's box sets which were changed in season 5 to "head shots" of Simpsons characters. After much protest, their distributor came out with original box set-style releases. Smaller package... less inserts... looks puny on the DVD rack next to the other EIGHT seasons... same price. Gotta love that marketing plan! I'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes MGM will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school
0	WISH WISH WISH never bought this DVD I tried the abs workout and because it's twisting you in a weird way, I injured my tail bone. That was in February of 2004. Since then, to this day I have pain (similar to arthritis) in my tailbone that gets aggravated from various activities, so I have to really watch out. I have better days and worse days. Once it does get aggravated, I'm doomed for weeks till it calms down. It's so annoying since I'm only 31 and it hurts right now even when I'm walking (I feel like I'm 71) I wish I had never come across this DVD!!!
0	Buy the Original Cast (1953) Instead IMHO, none of the cast could hold a candle to the original with Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, etc. These shows are all about the music - if the music doesn't make it, the whole production isn't worth two cents.
1	Great Popcorn flick This is a thoroughly entertaining movie that will keep you guessing. Kevin Spacey is perfect in this movie, and Benicio Del Torro and Gabriel Bryne do well in it too. The plot seems to be nothing out of the ordinary action/hiest/shoot-em-up movie plot that is found all to frequently in today's movie theaters, but the ending is what makes this movie a notable one. All great movies should have great endings, and this one does
0	Don't waste your money Unless your almost dead this DVD is just too easy and is not really Yoga. I have an old Rodney Yee VHS 20 minute tape that was great for a quickie and thought this was the same in DVD. It is not
1	The Plots have no equal My mother turned me on to this and it has been fun.. A pleasure to watch, not only for the Monk's character (worth the price alone), but for the ingenious plots. Check the Airport episode for a Woody Allen, in an stopped elevator, with a life insurance agent (Season 2: maid episode, season 3: 2yr old boy episode). Do yourself a favor and escape into a fun plotted twist of puzzlements, laughter, and of course: fitting the last pieces into a place with the Ahhh!! of satisfaction. Note some episodes better than others
1	a beautiful, moving cinematic masterpiece One of the most recent additions to my film collection is Vï¿½ctor Erice's Espï¿½ritu de la colmena (The spirit of the Beehive), made in 1973 in Spain. Franco's dictatorship was in its waning years - but the censorship the Generalissimo had fostered still remained in effect - many directors of the day had to fight to have their films shown. If they portrayed anything that had to do with the Spanish Civil War - especially showing the Resistance in a favorable light - they had to do it metaphorically. Some films were cut to ribbons by the censors, some were delayed almost indefinitely - and some never saw the light of day (or the dark of a cinema, if you like). Erice's first feature is set in 1940, and shows a Spain still reeling from the pain of the civil war. Set in a small village on the Castilian plain, the film speaks volumes about both the physical and psychological damage done by the conflict. The village is seen to be quite run down - the family at the center of the story lives in relative comfort in a large old manor house, but it, too, is in a state of neglect and disrepair. While quite spacious compared to the homes of their neighbors, the rooms are shown to contain little furniture - and the one meal we see the family sharing, a breakfast, is a sparse one. The members of the family seem to exist in their own isolated orbits - coming close to each other at times, but never really connecting. The two young sisters - Ana (Ana Torrent) and Isabel (Isabel Tellerï¿½a) - share more of a bond than the parents have with each other, or with their children. The girls' father (portrayed by popular Spanish actor Fernando Fernï¿½n Gï¿½mez) is a beekeeper - the first time we see him in the film, he's tending the hives, dressed in his protective gear, looking a bit like a space explorer. Their mother (Teresa Gimpera) writes letters to an unnamed man - from the address seen on an envelope in one scene, a refugee from the fighting living in a camp in France. We never learn if he is a former lover, a relative, or just an old friend caught up in forces over which he has little control - but from the frequency of her letters to him, and the emotional depth of the words she writes (which we hear in a voice-over), it's obvious this is a person about whom she cares a great deal, and whose absence torments her. The girls are the real focus of the story - especially the youngest, Ana. She appears to be around 6 years old - at that age when the fantasies of childhood are about to be pushed aside by the realities of life, a time of difficult transition for a child. She still accepts everything she sees as being real - fiction is an unknown concept to her. A travelling cinema comes to town, setting up in the town hall - it's clearly something that has happened before, and we see the children gather around the van, before the dust has even settled, clamoring to know what film will be shown. On this occasion, it happens to be James Whale's 1931 classic version of Frankenstein. Ana and Isabel are among the children and adults who crowd into the makeshift theatre to see the film. Ana is captivated by the entire spectacle - and as I mentioned, she's at the age when everything she sees on the screen is as real to her as what she sees on the street everyday. Ana Torrent, the young actress who portrays Ana in the film, had never seen Frankenstein before - and in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film, we see her face in the dark, illuminated only by the light reflecting from the screen, as she reacts, honestly and openly, eyes wide in wonder, not acting, to the story before her. At one point, she leans over to her sister Isabel and asks, `Why did the monster kill the little girl? Why did they kill the monster?' Isabel tells her later, as the girls lie in their beds, awaiting sleep, that `it's all make-believe - nothing in the movies is real'. Ana's not buying it. Still obsessed with the experience and story of the film, she later listens intently to a story Isabel tells her of a spirit that lives nearby, in an abandoned barn. Isabel warns Ana that the spirit will only appear when called by someone with a pure heart, who believes it is real. Ana returns to the barn several times, calling `It's me - Ana', to no avail. After a few visits, she arrives at the barn to find it occupied - a wounded freedom fighter, on the run from Franco's guard, has taken shelter there. When he awakens with a start, hearing a noise, he immediately draws his pistol - seeing that it's Ana, he relaxes. Ana is either determined that this man is the spirit she has been seeking, or simply decides to make him into the spirit, and befriends him - she offers him an apple, and later sneaks out of her house with her father's jacket, to keep the man warm at night, inadvertently neglecting to remove her father's pocket watch before handing it over to him. Ana's vision of this man as her own manifestation of the spirit is shattered when he is caught by Franco's police and killed. Her father is called to the makeshift morgue - once again, using the town hall, returning to the scene of the film that affected Ana so much - to view the body. The police captain has found the pocket watch on the dead man, and has connected it to Ana's father - he's obviously been brought in for questioning, probably a common practice in a society under the shadow of Franco's paranoia. His assurances that he didn't know the man, or how his jacket and watch came to be in his possession, are evidently taken as truth, and he is allowed to take his property and go home. When he confronts Ana with the watch, simply by opening it at the breakfast table and allowing the chiming mechanism to sound, it's pretty apparent from her facial expression that she knows something about it. He later follows her to the barn - she doesn't know that the man has been captured and killed - and when her father attempts to talk with her there, she runs from him. Her failure to return home prompts a search party made up of villagers scouring the woods and countryside at night, carrying lanterns - a striking visual reminder of the scene in Whale's Frankenstein when the villagers searched for the monster carrying torches. Ana is found sleeping in the ruins of an old castle, and brought home, obviously traumatized. As we see her sleeping in the room she shares with Isabel, we notice that Isabel's bed has been stripped of its linen - perhaps a sign that Isabel, being a couple of years older, is now in her own room, having `grown up' sufficiently in the eyes of her parents to warrant this `promotion'. Ana's experiences have left her changed - but how much is unclear. The border she has crossed - or is beginning to take the first steps in crossing, at least - is one that is not skipped over in the course of a day or two. It's something that takes years to accomplish. As the film ends, we see her poignantly calling out to her spirit once more, `It's me - Ana'. The cinematography in this film is astonishingly beautiful - Luï¿½s Cuadrado worked miracles, not just in his camera angles and framing, but in capturing the honey-colored light that is so essential in conveying the feeling and atmosphere of this film. In the documentary The footprints of a spirit - one of the several fine extras included in Criterion's new DVD release of the film - director Vï¿½ctor Erice and his co-screenwriter Angel Fernï¿½ndez Santos, speak of their original intended storyline, and how they wound up discarding the opening scenes - they said that once they started filming, they realized that the opening, looking back from the present to the time depicted in the body of the film, was a drag on the overall effect. It's an interesting look into the creative process. As it turned out, the film is as close to perfect as cinema can get. Criterion has done a masterful job in restoring and packaging it for re-release. Since I've never had the opportunity to see this work in a theatre on the big screen, I have nothing with which to compare it - but I can say that this is one of the most beautifully filmed, moving cinematic creations I've ever experienced.
0	Dissapointing second season with some good moments Overall I found the season to be a big bore. I am not a hugh fan and season 1 was pretty good but not great but I had to watch this season and will continue to watch the other season's. The season started good but went downhill fast becouse nothing happend you can miss all season adn it will be right were you left off. There are good moments like the last few episodes were really good. Overall not a great second season
0	**Stories & More Stories From The Acoustic Highway** First off let me start off by saying that I am a very big fan of Edwin McCain, his band, and his music. I bought this DVD thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing, but was only left with my pocket's empty, and my hopes shattered. Edwin McCains personality is portrayed here, as all other reviewers have said, but that really is all that this DVD does well. With only about 15 minutes of Live music I, as a viewer was left asking myself why Edwin and ATC Records decided to put this disc out. The only notable music on this DVD is "I'll Be". This is very easily Edwin's lowest quality item put out, lacking the passion, and originiality that so many of us know him by. A noteworthy Story, if not the only one is the story of how he wrote I'll Be, and the only reason that it is noteworthy, is not because it is a great story, but rather I'll Be is a great track. So if you have money to spare, and time to waste then you can buy this DVD, but unless Edwin releases a new DVD I suggest, that you stick to his CD's
0	A Big Waste Of Time!!!! I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder
0	Amazingly bad--- don't buy it, don't even rent it! This film is unwatchable-- and the only question is what talented actors like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver are doing in this insipid hack job. When it comes to dialogue, not a single word rings true. None of the characters make any sense at all. They are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull, and so ridiculously unbelievable, that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words, rather than a cognizant human being. We couldn't get through it, as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about. I see that view validated by the other reviewers with more persistence who watched this thing until the end. It's amazing he ever got funding for this ultimate turkey
1	Just what a movie should be! This movie takes you away for 90 minutes into the arms of someone who can deliver a line so effortlessly you forget he is an actor. He and Miss Graham are a delighful odd couple and Miss Driver, trying to find a place to smoke in America, is perfect British allure. If you are a Colin Firth fan, it is worth every penny
0	Movie is TOP - DVD is a FLOP! This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous. But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list. The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer. This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick
0	Empty shell I have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi's acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly. Alas, not a film that I can recommend to anyone.
1	A Confused New Order fanatic! Can someone PLEASE let me know if this is the DVD box set titled ITEM. Some reviwers say it is, others insist it isn't. Based on Amazon's product description it sounds as if this is the ITEM set. Regardless, Amazon need to correct either the DVD title or the content description. I'd just like to say that, personally, New Order peaked with Technique. Everything they released up to and including that LP was BRILLIANT. The Perfect Kiss promo video is sublime. If this is the ITEM box set, it's worth owning just to see the full length version of the UK made NewOrderStory documentary. It's a pity what became of New Order. They were once BRILLIANT.
0	Getting Older Not Better The Prisoner of Azkaban Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of "Star Wars", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults. The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls "The Invisible Man". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?] Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. "Harry Potter" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class?
0	If you are looking for a real documentary, this is not it The editor decided that I don't want to see how the plane crashes into WTC, or how people jump from windows, so, he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else. Instead, there is a plenty of news people's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking (and why do I care?), plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left.
0	I have got two words to descibes what I thought of this... AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH! I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake. The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!! In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying "Check Please".
0	1 STAR FOR UNIVERSAL'S PISS POOR TRANSFER TO DVD This show is my all time favorite, however Universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser, and a wrong Season Premier Intro! DVD is meant to bring out the best in media, not the worst, how could they lose sound effects? Unbelievable! Just doesn't seem possible... SEASON 4 is no better... UNIVERSAL PLEASE READ THIS AND RE-RELEASE SEASON 3 AND 4 ALREADY, THE FANS ARE EXTREMELY PISSED OFF!
1	Good retelling of a great anime series 'Escaflowne', the movie, is basically a retelling of the popular (and wonderful) series. However the movie is a lot darker, a lot of characters in the series have been left out, and some events have been altered, so do not expect to see a movie that stays true to and anime series. For example, movies like (Cowboy Bebop, 4 of Inuyasha movies, 3 of DragonBall movies, 10 of DragonBall Z movies, Blue Gender the movie, Yu Yu Hakusho the movie)
0	Horrid! This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical "life affirming" stories. There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy
0	Save your money Soft core porn masquerading as art, I didn't even make it through the first half hour of this film. Lola's cute, but it's still not worth the effort
0	I wish I could have rated it 0 star I decided to buy this movie after reading many excellent reviews of it. I watched it with my girlfriend. Bad idea... The sex scenes are bad and very short, and the rest is downright boring. This movie is simply bad, and slow, and generally laughable
0	never did get it. sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost 1 year later i still havent gotten the book, a response from amazon, or a response from the shipper
1	Some good raunchy fun to watch Look out "Sluts in the City!", The Brits have beat you to the punch and did a much better job to boot! If you want to see some outstanding satire of the loony fringes of society. I can safely recommend this for your consideration. Its pricey but worth it
1	not my favorite seasons but still a must own.... I had never watched Mr. Show up until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on TBS slightly edited. I was hooked and began recording every episode on Tivo, until I realized they seemed to be edited so I picked up the 4th season and loved it, there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing, my favorite being the story of Everest. I finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times, and while I found myself laughing out loud often, I didn't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season, aside from one or 2 sketches, not too much really stick out like the majority of season four. A must own if you're a true fan of the show, for the commentary alone
0	A Great Propagandist that would of made Gobbels proud Chomsky is nothing more than a liberal propaganda artist. His views that the Stalinist Military defeated Nazi Germany is proof of his leanings. He is the left wing Rush Limbaugh of written media
0	i guess i'm the only person on here that finds this one the PITS!!! this never rises above the slease and sexualy warped mind of mr. de palma. angie dickison's shower scenes are just a sick joke like the whole movie. watch a hitchcock movie if you want a good thriller,and stay away from this junk!!
1	Lethal Western With a renewed interest of the "Western" genre in 80's & 90's(YOUNG GUNS, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN) and classic tv series being made into films,MAVERICK was a natural. To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying "I'm getting too old for this ----!") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western. Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride. James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it. The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc. Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy "Angel", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out. Lastly, veteran James Garner is good in everything he does. The closing scenes with Garner & Gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying. Overall, fun, light, entertaining and perfect
1	Great Tidbits I didn't love everything about this film. In fact, the first time I saw it, I felt it was lacking in depth. But the second time I watched it, many little moments shone through and I saw the depth of emotion being prtrayed. First, Payton's performance as Andrew really hit a few times. When he first starts warming up to Christian (as Christian grows more confident) by responding to Christian's teasing, I thought this was some complex and genuine emotions. There's a great "you bitch, okay, let me see that" moment. Second, I liked Aaron's genuineness when Bisset's character is suffering and he knows he doesn't have anything to make her feel good. I also like the fact that he put Bisset's character's needs ahead of his own agenda of converting people. Finally, I thought the best moment was between Aaron and his mom (Mary Kay Place) as Place's character begins to comprehend the suffering of her son and begins to get past her prejudices. After my second viewing, I fell in love with the film. Worth owning.
1	Madagascar This is a cute movie. The creators of this one have one fabulous imagination. I highly recommend watching this film. However, this is not for small children.
1	John Ford/John Wayne : American Classics I ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself, and I wasn't disapointed. The new print of "The Searchers" with all the extras(lobby cards,reprint of the dell comic, and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set-- In addition you get a two dvd set for Stagecoach(which started the Ford/Wayne partnership),Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,3 Godfaters,They Were Expendable,Wings Of Eagles, and The Long Voyage Home. The only thing I would have chaged is that I would have made almost All the movies in this set westerns(The Searchers,Stagecoach,Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,Rio Grande,3 Godfathers,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Quiet Man(which isn't a western, but I think it fits in well)would have been my choice for the set. That aside I think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of John Ford(or John Wayne)will not be disappointed.
1	Don't hesitate to buy RENT I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less. I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!
0	No Diamonds....Just Rough This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, "I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry "Flash" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity
0	Another over rated movie Please do not compare this with Clock Work Orange. It's shame. This movie is shame on director. Cutting many heads or killing more bodies does not prove movie is good. This movie is like B grade stuff. Plot is good, but not the direction or screen play
0	not quite as enthralling as I had hoped... Granted, I should have seen this coming, having read Louisa May Alcott's predictable preteen novel before buying the film version. I guess I was hoping that the movie would fix up all the flat characterizations and narrow plotlines I had lamented while reading Alcott's early piece. Alas, I put too much faith in cinema. The movie did absolutely nothing to improve upon the book. The main female character is far too demure and morally perfect to connect in any real way with her audience (which actually seems to sell more books than I would think, as per Janette Oke) and the female antagonist is villified to the extent that she no longer seems human. The male love-interest is the traditional tall, dark, handsome, and vacuous one who, though faithful to his love, lacks any sort of purpose outside of wooing her. Overarching these characterization flaws is a general lack of cinematographic care that relegates this movie to the "made-for-TV" genre, which, though not dominated solely by poor films, is not known for its quality. To me, it was much like watching a Lifetime movie: predictable, entertaining for lack of an alternative, and not terribly significant. Don't read me incorrectly. This movie is great for anyone who is just plain bored. If you don't enjoy actually watching the movie, you will probably enjoy laughing incredulously as each character delivers horrible lines. Hey, it's only 6 bucks, anyway. Why not buy it and see for yourself? It's what I did, and just because I was disappointed doesn't mean you have to be
1	A great drama, with amazing depth 'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they concieved of this complex story. The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard. Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the proffesor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neigborhood in south Boston. As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future. Filled with great profound dialouges and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotinal experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertaints throughout. It's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtelties
0	You've Got to be Kidding Me While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie. This movie was just plain stupid. They should have kept this film story in the states. Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time. I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan. So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students? Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do? Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment? I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese. Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet. The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful. Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here. Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture. Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students. There would be nothing further from the truth. Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here. Not by a long shot. Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant. The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.
0	Not worth watching All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.
0	Wouldn't buy it again This video covers several basic exercises you can do with an exercise ball. I don't care for the woman who does it -- I find her personality a little annoying. That aside, there is no way to do the exercises straight through without title segues between each position. This makes for a long workout with too much rest between positions. It's nice the first time through because you are just learning. But I would have preferred an option for a traditional style video without titles and intro descriptions for each position
1	Busy doing nothing A drifter named Trinity (Terence Hill) slides into a dusty frontier town where he discovers his outlaw brother Bambino (Bud Spencer) is sheriff. Disguised as sheriff, that is. Bambino wants to rustle a herd of valuable horses; Trinity is enamored of a pair of comely Mormon lasses. There's more to THEY CALL ME TRINITY than that, of course, but not a lot more. The Mormons want to settle in a nearby valley and build a community. An unscrupulous land-baron (Farley Granger) wants to intimidate them out. There's a band of Mexican banditos swooping down every so often to test the resolve of the peace loving settlers. The draw of this one, though, is the quiet comedy and the interplay between Hill and Spencer. Hill's Trinity is lithe and tanned, Bambino is bearded and hulking - they've got a Little Joe & Hoss thing going. Impossibly quick on the draw and dominating in all of the film's many fights, Trinity is about as laid-back a spaghetti western hero as you're going to find. Heck, he rides in to and out of the movie barefoot and asleep on a makeshift stretcher dragged by his horse, holstered gun trailing in the dust. Hollywood (and Italia) was cranking out counter-culture rebels with droning regularity back in the late sixties/early seventies, most with `off the man' `tudes and ten-pound chips on their shoulders. What's refreshing about Trinity is that about the only thing he's rebelling against is physical exertion and grown-up responsibility. Bambino may be a crook, but he's agreeably grumpy and, besides, those horses he wants to rustle belong to the evil Major. THEY CALL ME TRINITY is usually called a comedy-western, but its humor provokes smiles rather than belly laughs. It's a good, fun, unchallenging way to spend an hour and a half. Unfortunately, the Direct Source video version is pretty hard on the eyes. It's presented in full-screen, edited down from its 2.35:1 aspect ration. Worst of all the picture looks like it was duped off a bad video tape - indistinct images, faded colors, etc. This one isn't a classic, but it's one of the better spaghetti westerns, and deserves a better presentation than it gets here.
1	GREAT DVD!! This DVD is great for Adults and Children alike... Filled with hours of Pluto!
1	The Magic Continues Its very rare when a sequel holds the same magical charm as its first but this sequel has done just that. If you loved the first movie, you'll be equally pleased with this one. The original cast along with holding true to the book series makes this a must see
1	RPMJr Good action flick. Being from Detroit made the movie even cooler. The way it all went down had me on the edge, great suspence
1	Superb documentary What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void. The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it. Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.
1	Excellent makeover for a masterpiece Many of the other reviews have summarized Akira Kurosawa's excellent film, so I won't recap it since you are probably familiar with The Seven Samurai. Rather, if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release, rest easy. It is well worth the price. Having seen the movie many, many times, I was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seen new and brought out many details I had missed. The supplemental materials (commentaries, documentaries, interviews, and the booklet (with reminiscences from Mifune Toshiro) complement the movie nicely. If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it. This DVD is worth it
0	Not True to the Book My twelve year old who read and loved the E. Nesbit book Five Children and It hated this movie. I have also read the book, and the movie has very little in common with the original story. There is no eccentric uncle and cousin Horace or secret door in the greenhouse. The children are not sent to the country because of the war. Even the wishes the children make are not true to the book. My nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book. So, although it is pleasant, clean, family entertainment, I think E. Nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book. It seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized E. Nesbit's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from C.S. Lewis' Chronicle of Narnia series
0	Box set 3 will be the last set... There is a preview in Box set #2 , in which he makes a commercial like that of BrokeBack Mountain in which he says the final 42 episodes on DVD in Set 3.. Shame on you Mr. Judge.. only 120 episodes out of about 200+ are getting the DVD digital cut? in the words of your own created characters..you suck!! Rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite Fart-knocker Mike Judge limiting his release of titles.. Mike Judge the ultimate tool.. huh huh, he said tool
1	Laramie Project dvd arrived in condition stated and within the estimated delivery time. thank you
0	Meet John Doe I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie. I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found. Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe. I guess it's a little late to complain now
1	Contains the best song in the world's: Tribute! This duo led by Jack Black is flipping sweet! Jack's sax-a-boom absolutely rips the audience into shreds. This is fun music. (Not for the kids' ears, per se, but if they're teens I'll bet they've already borrowed the album from a friend that has older siblings that grow weed and otherwise contribute to your kids' delinquency. Buy this so when you catch them listening to the album you can both sit down together and really bond over some cool tunes.
1	It's a entertaining film but not everyone can embrace Sincity. Sin city wasn't really the type of film that everyone would appreciate, one must remember this film comes right out a comic book, i love Bruce Willis is like one of my favorite actors and he had the perfect voice to do the story telling, his character role was let's say typical Bruce, it can be considered a simple story with a light twist, the plot was reasonable and all in all enjoyable at least for me, i say it's worth a watch laterz folks.
1	Totally Worth It Just the packaging alone makes this box set worthwhile. I've never seen anything like it. The exterior is like a Trapper Keeper, slick plastic that's kind of puffy and soft to the touch. It then folds out into four DVD trays and has a really well designed booklet, talking about the films and the genre (Sukeban). I just got my copy and everyone that's been over and seen it has flipped out about the box, `cause it just looks so cool (and is so pink). The bonus CD of Reiko Ike singing is mounted in with the booklet and is weird and kind of a novelty. I put it on at a party a couple of weeks ago and people were way into it. The movies are cool too. "Criminal Woman: Killing Melody" is my favorite, but the end of "Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless to Confess" is amazing. There's no way that Quentin Tarintino didn't see it before he made "Kill Bill". I just read on the website of the company that put out the set (Panik House) that they pre-sold 2/3 of the run of 10,000 and they think they're going to sell out soon, so if you're at all interested in getting a copy of this you should. Now. It was totally worth the money

0	It's about kids at a "musical camp" for wannabe performers These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at "Camp Ovation" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a "one hit wonder" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a "fag hag", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem. There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people.
0	Damaged I hear this is a good movie, but can't play it as the DVD is visibly damaged. So what about Quality control? This disc should never have gotten out the door, but the odd thing is, I ordered 2 DVD's from Amazon - different titles, both damaged. Are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us? "F
1	They may be grandmothers to the "Desperate Housewives," but have things really changed that much since the late Forties? This gem of a movie is a neglected classic of Americana. "A Letter to Three Wives" uses many of the same talents who made "All About Eve" such a hit a year later, most notably Joseph L. Mankiewicz as the writer/director and Celeste Holm, who is present here in voice only as Addie Ross, the town flirt. Just as three of the town's more prominent clubwomen are about to depart on a day-long trip with underprivileged children, they receive a note from Addie--she has run off with one of their husbands. They have the whole day to think about which one it was. The Jeanne Crain character is insecure because she left her Iowa roots and married up to one of the town gentry. The Linda Darnell character was "shanty Irish" and married a department store millionaire with whom they share a rather grudging relationship. Ann Sothern plays a radio screenwriter who is trying to maneuver her way out of the second-best neighborhood in town into the very best. Along with sharp observations about class and social climbing in small towns/suburbia, this film has sharp writing and acting and some genuinely funny moments, including a star turn from Kirk Douglas as a droll English teacher (bet you thought you'd never see HIM in a comedy!). Look for the wonderful Thelma Ritter as the maid from the wrong side of the tracks. All in all, "A Letter to Three Wives" is a great entertainment and a welcome addition to any video collection. I have seen my copy several times and introduced it to several people.
0	A little good, mostly bad... I had seen scenes from this flick on IFC, so I finally decided to watch the whole thing. While there are a few plusses, there are many more minuses. There was some really good production design here, the cinematography was good, and there are some funny moments (one of the killers has a shirt on saying "cheap Halloween costume", and there's a poster for a missing dog head). The performances by the 2 cops (in one scene anyway) are actually pretty good. I think this has to do more with the 2 actors than Zombie's directorial skills. Now the bad. One reviewer has noted that essentially this is a remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, except nowhere near as good (or intense). First of all, you don't really give a damn about the victims here (2 couples who seem to despise each other). They're really obnoxious and stupid at the beginning, and after they get abducted, tortured, and killed, you don't really care. There are so many references to other horror films (and some blatant ripoffs, especially of Chainsaw) that it seems like a cover version rather than an original film. The acting is obnoxious and pretty bad, except for the 2 cops. But even their performances are strange. They are only in 2 scenes. They are absolute jerks in their first scene, but in their second scene, they show some depth and are sincere. I think that's indictative of the movie. Sometimes it seems it wants to be funny, other times horrific. Of course, there's no real explanation to the actual "house of 1000 corpses" that one of the girls gets thrown into at the end of the film. Zombie wasn't trying to be ambiguous or anything. It just doesn't make a damn bit of sense. And the ending sucks. It seems that they just did it to give it a lame twist ending. There are many plot holes (after the police are killed, there are no cops that follow up on it. There would be in real life). Overall, it's a pretty stupid film.
0	Not enough variation Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments. The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves. If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you
0	Wholesome, weird, and dull This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altuistic slant. It wasn't a "bad" movie it simply wasn't a "good" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzz
1	Great lower body workout!!! In just the first few minutes I began to feel the burn This workout works all the leg muscles. You will feel as though you have run a marathon!!!
1	Amazing Inspiration If you enjoy adventure stories, and look up to those people who meet challenges placed before them; this is a DVD not to be missed. Be sure to watch the "extra features" items on the DVD, as they take an incredible story, to even new heights as additional facts about Shackleton's journey are revealed, about this most incredible survivor story of all time. A must watch for the entire family
0	a lot of effort, little substance. There's not too much I can offer here, since I found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie. A lot of nice shots of the robots in this, and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings. I'm sure there has been some debate over the use of Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie, but that's not something that I think really applies to my overall sense of the film. I am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema. A lot of the camera angles, costumes, the shapes of the robots and weapons, all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore, and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction, as silly as they may look to us today. But this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane. There are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future, and because of that they're not often harked upon. Instead, this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments, a spiffy sidekick, and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating. This movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance.
1	THE INSIDER ILLUSTRATES HOW 1 PERSON CAN STILL MAKE A HUGE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE A TRUE STORY THAT'S STILL TOUCHING LIVES TODAY & FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE TOO The Insider tells the true story of how Jeffrey Wigand [played by Russell Crowe] told the world what the major tobacco companies knew and concealed about the dangers posed to consumers by their cigarettes. The Insider is presented with tangible class and with an appropriately heavy docudrama feel. In my opinion, "The Insider" is director Michael Mann's best film to date and was nominated for seven Academy awards. Excellent acting by Pacino, Crowe and Plummer. YES - THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY FOR BEING A WHISTLEBLOWER & IT COMES IN MANY THANKLESS FORMS!!!!! The film's setting is saturated with an eerie and believable atmosphere of paranoia. The sinking feeling that the unseen enemy [the tobacco company] will be coming from somewhere seems to be both infectious and believable throughout the film. The price Wigand pays for his integrity is dear and continues to this day. His personal loss rivals the tobacco company's but unlike them he consciously decided to do the "right thing" regardless of that cost. Amplifying the significance of Wigand's whistle blowing decision, where in effect 1 man [Jeffrey Wigand] does stand up completely alone against the threats of big tobacco, CBS "Corporate" caves in to the tobacco company's lawsuit threats. After taping the interview CBS corporate hits the chicken switch over airing Mike Wallace's interview with Wigands much as the tobacco company had hoped the wistleblower would have. This subplot through analogy clearly demonstrates the power of one ordinary man against a powerful corrupt system and clearly illustrates how 1 person can still make a big difference. Jeffrey Wigand standing up to be counted did make a difference in this case. A HUGE DIFFERENCE! YES - -1 PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE: A BIG DIFFERENCE HERE! On a smaller scale the filmakers' effort here is another example of how 1 man can make a difference though the risk is far smaller. Interestingly, though the film was nominated for 7 academy awards it came away with none. I guess Whistleblowing for a just cause will still have to be its own reward. * -- * ABRIDGED LIST OF THE CAST * -- * Al Pacino - Lowell Bergman Russell Crowe - Jeffrey Wigand Christopher Plummer - Mike Wallace Diane Venora - Liane Wigand Philip Baker Hall - Don Hewitt Lindsay Crouse - Sharon Tiller Debi Mazar - Debbie De Luca Stephen Tobolowsky - Eric Kluster Colm Feore - Richard Scruggs Bruce McGill - Ron Motley Rip Torn - John Scanlon Lynne Thigpen - Mrs. Williams Nestor Serrano - FBI Agent Robertson Pete Hamill - N.Y.

0	Laney Boggs was robbed... I first saw this movie in high school-I believe i was a senior-And I remember thinking, "High school is NOT like this at all!" Throughout the whole movie. Now, I do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world, where anything is possible (except Laney Boggs becoming Prom Queen of course), but I felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie. First of all, why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a Prom Queen??? In my school, the Homecoming Court and Prom Court were chock full of nice, friendly kids, and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities, not because they were HOT like Taylor Vaugh or whatever her name was. I hate that stereotype because it doesn't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest! Also, What was so terribly heinous about Rachel Lee Cook that they would pick her over ANY other girl in the school-So what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body...her only flaw was her love for being a loner. Freddy Prinze Jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone WAYYYYYYY downhill since this movie was released. The best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when Laney walks down the stairs to Sixpence None The Richer's song KISS ME. The BIGGEST let down of this movie to me though was that Taylor won Prom Queen over Laney. Seriously, that still pisses me off to this day. The ending was just a complete and utter bomb...I wanted that skank Taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had SOME minor bad thing happen to her. She was just a horrible, snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her. Oh well, this movie is pretty lame...I will always remember it though because I saw it in the theater with three of my close friends our senior year. Cheesy movie...Laney Boggs was robbed!!
0	This movie was ok, but sucked at the same time I laughed a few times in this movie but was more annoyed then anything..I was left with a horrible feeling in me after the movie was over..If I wanted a downer of a ending I could just go out and watch the the different [...] that happens in the world....I waited for a long time to rent this movie, now I wish I never had rented this movie because my money I spent will go to support movies like this....What a waste of time....BBBBOOOOOOOO!!!!! All the hype was built up into a bowl of [...]....
1	Season 2 blazes ahead and makes Season 1 look like nothing! Season 2 of this fantastic 80s detective series brings a new feel to the show. Most notably, Murphy and Bernice Fox are gone, and replaced by Doris Roberts (now known more for playing Marie Barone on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND). It is likely that the writers determined that Murphy was leading the show into "love triangle" territory in Season 1, and that fans just wanted Remington and Laura to be together without the complications. At the same time, Bernice Fox seemed to serve no purpose beyond appearing at the desk whenever the lobby was shown. So, they combined the two into Ms. Krebs, a character who could fill the role of secretary, while also occasionally appearing outside the office without posing a threat to the Steele/Holt relationship. While Murph and Fox are missed, Doris Roberts shines in the role, especially in the later seasons. Unfortunately, the season begins with an hour-and-a-half episode that is almost a chore to sit through. In a seeming attempt to bring to mind the James Bond feel of exotic locations, the composer even went so far as to score a theme for the action scenes that is so obviously a combination of the original Bond Theme and the melody of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. This season opener is the beginning of the "exotic locale" episodes, and increasingly over the next three seasons we would see the team travel to Mexico, Malta, Britain, Ireland . . . I never really cared for these episodes. I preferred them staying in LA with the pretty night ligths and almost noirish atmosphere. At any rate, things pick up in the second episode as Laura comes under personal attack so unrelenting, that it costs her a house! A scene midway with Laura staring blankly at the burning rubble as she musters the strength to carry on is an early performance high for the fantastic Stephanie Zimbalist. Brosnan himself would shine a few episodes later when framed for a murder he didn't commit. This episode inroduces a recurring character who proves to be quite a foil to the pair. Also introduced this season is the vintage Auburn automobile, which would get an entire episode devoted to its own mystery before becoming a regular fixture on the show. All told, Season 2 manages to grow the potential of the show beyond the "mystery of the week" that was Season 1. We really get to explore with more depth what makes both characters work - and with Murphy out of the way, Steele is free to become a little more macho and self-assured. But do not worry - there is still enough of the slightly-bumbling Cary Grant style that makes him so lovable! My only real complaint with this season is that the writers never really seemed to be clear on where the "relationship" between the two was headed. They might have a major romance scene in one episode, then have NO romance for a stretch of four or five - and then suddenly be close again. After awhile, the relationship becomes frankly boring, and the stories take center stage. However, it is still great TV, and another well-produced DVD set for the money. As before, the handful of 10-minute documentary shorts are spread throughout the four discs, and are nostalgiac and quick paced so as to be enjoyed without being overlong. All told, this is a worthy set - and no, I'm not going to say it's a STEELE at any price! That's getting old now!
0	Take a little THX-1138, add some Logan's Run... oh, and Michael Bay... What do you get? Well, a lawsuit for plagiarism, but that isn't what I'm going to talk about here. The Island started pretty well. Production design was great. The story was intriguing. Very nice job of introducing questionable elements into the 'perfect society'. I thought Michael Bay was going to surprise me. The product placement was irritating and cheesy, but I could live with it. While the writing was pretty corny, it was still nice to see Michael Bay trying something a little different for him. Something smarter. But once our heroes escape, the movie nosedives. It felt like two completely different movies were tacked together. As I said, I was enjoying the beginning. The survivors of an unspecified "contamination" dwell within a sterile, self-contained city. Their happiness and well being is paramount to those in charge. They are watched over and coddled. They have no real concerns. They live a life of leisure while holding out hope that they will be the next lottery winner, which promises them a one-way trip to The Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth. Once you discover The Truth, the rest of the movie degrades to non-stop car and foot chases. Explosions, shattered glass and twisted metal and lots of running and yelling fill out the last hour and a half or so. I'm all for action movies. Loved Die Hard and many Schwarzenegger movies. It's that the over-the-top action seemed so out of place with this particular story. It seems to me that if I was the head of a company and its' future was up in the air because some damaging information was stolen, I wouldn't think that the best solution would be to send a heavily armed militia through crowded downtown Los Angeles to retrieve it. For the story that was being told, some Hitchcock style suspense would have worked much better. Like I said, the start was promising. Then the movie switched gears. After about an hour I was just wishing the movie would end already. I've read that this is Michael Bay's best movie yet. That may be, but it sure doesn't say much for him as a director. I've just found out that this movie was plagiarized from 'The Clonus Horror'. That one got the MST3K treatment, but I'm betting that I'll still enjoy it more than this movie
0	Hindsight is 20/20 Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie. I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts. (I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.) Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it. And I always wanted to hear the song "Maniac" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in. So, how was it? Not too bad. Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work. The plot is a by-the-book "believe in your dreams" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film. I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time. I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat. Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood: It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer! Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since
0	LOVE AFFAIR - JUST ANOTHER UPDATED CLASSIC THAT DIDN'T WORK Many of the reviews I read felt strongly in favor of this remake, but some of the people had not seen "An Affair to Remember". Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr had the spark so lacking in this "Love Affair" remake. The original "Love Affair" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this "Love Affair", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of "An Affair to Remember", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely. As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of "An Affair...", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be "worthy of her love". I don't wish to underrate or "dump" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once. I believe they will become "old movie buffs" too. Thanks for reading my review
1	I Love Gene Kelly! I grew up with Gene Kelly performances and so this box set is wonderful. "Singin' on the Rain" is one of his classics, as well as one of his best performances. "On the Town" and "An American in Paris" are suberb too, highlighting Kelly's different strengths. I especially liked "Anatomy of a Dancer" though because it shed light on Kelly's life that I did not know. As such I grew to respect him and his work even more. I highly recommend it for Gene Kelly followers and musical lovers alike
0	NOT FOR DIE-HARD FANS!! If you are a fan of the ORIGINAL Empire Records, DON'T buy the Re-Mixed Fan version... it's a big dissappointment. There are added scenes in the movie, and some of the BEST lines are changed. Example: When Rex is leaving the store and says "Why don't you all just fade away." Yeah, he doesn't say that in this version. I was very dissappointed when I saw this, b/c die-hard Empire fans DON'T want the best lines changed, so this really isn't a "fan re-mix" b/c it changes stuff the fans LOVE!!! Definitely just buy the regular DVD or VHS version... it's much better as an original, not a re-mix!!!
1	A very good romatic comedy Let me first say I think this was one of Julia Roberts best roles in a film. And Hugh Grant plays a very low key laid back guy not without dry wit and humor. Even though this could never happen in real life, it is a charming film. My wife and I saw it in the theatre and own it on DVD. This film works on several levels. The humor and the romance with some clever writing. Grant's unasumming casual character, William Thaker, is changed when he meets megastar Anna Scott (Roberts) in his travel book store and she is browsing through books on Turkey. Grant, "That book is not very good if browsing turns into buying, whereas this author (holding up a different book) has actually been to Turkey." She leaves the store and he later bumps into her on the street and spills orange juice on her, creating the need for her to change her clothing. Grant lives just across the street. So the romance begins. Grant's roommate, Spike, is quite a character. A slovenly smoker, who doesn't wash his clothes or clean up after himself. A quirky kind of guy that ads some comedic moments to the film. Grant's sister in the film is totally the opposite of his character. Overally talkative, wild hair, wide eyes and they don't resemble each other. You have to suspend belief that she could actually be his sister. Grant's friends are believeable and quite funny at times. When his good friend is driving through London and everyone in the car is trying to give him directions he slams on the brakes and tells them to be quiet, "James Bond never has to put up with this kind of sh**." The musical score works quite well I believe. I enjoy many of the songs from the CD, with the exception of "She" by Costello. His voice is wrong for the song. The beginning and ending scenes of the film have the song. It would have been better to close the film with "When You Say Nothing at All" sung by Ronan Keating. The song is used quite well in a previous scene in the same setting. Shania Twain sings "You've got a way in the closing credits and Boyzone also contribute with an abbreviated "No Matter What" written by Andrew Lloyd Webber in the closing credits. One of the best uses of a song is Bill Withers "Ain't No Sunshine" sung as Grant walks through scenes showing the passing of time by the change of seasons. Very well done. Knowing how the press hound celebrities it is difficult to believe Anna Scott, a mega film star with pictures everywhere, is not followed by papparazzi every time she leaves her London hotel and that people don't recognize her when she is with Grant in public. I would recommend this film
0	Hahahaha ... What a "deep" plot ! This movie is only good for those that "love" Alyssa Milano. Plot? It isn't non-existent. It DOES exist but it's a complete crap! Period. Just an excuse to show skin. Regarding the DVD, it's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most New Line Cinema releases, anamorphic and stuff, plus it's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions. You won't be disappointed in that aspect
0	Walt Must Be Twisting In His Grave! This movie is very bad, and I mean HORRIBLE. Vin Diesel cannot act! What the heck was he thinking?! Walt Disney must be twisting in his grave!! I will never see this film ever again. The rest of the cast is disgusting, stupid, and terrible. They get dumber in every part of the movie, and a baby cries through a couple of parts of the film... and it gets very ANNOYING. If Walt Disney were alive, he'd yell at Vin Diesel, and all the actors in this movie. And the final thing, this is not "comedy" AT ALL.
1	it is still fun !! Even after all the years, the show is entertaining -- not rocket science stuff but just plain fun & entertaining. The cast stay to character show to show (& season to season). While the plots aren't complicated, they allow the viewer to escape for about 25 minutes into enjoyment, & KNOWING that the good guys will triumph & live to fight another day
1	Best video on the market If you are looking for a great video that teaches young minds simple messages of God's love, then look no further! My 5 month old daughter prefers this to Baby Einstein! Buy it! It's guaranteed!!!
0	Great DVD My three year old loves this DVD and has discovered the joys of Goofy, BUT... Why can you just set the DVD to play all? The Mickey collection you can just set it and forget it. This collection you must keep selecting the next cartoon (it does not even default to the next cartoon). POOR SHOW DISNEY
0	bias media on media bias starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti-corperate rant.the problem with the media is bias, the problem with this film is the same bias
0	moral relativism =propaganda The high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by George Orwell ( OR Francis Schaeffer, or Theodore Dalrymple or even John Mortimer -for the loyal opposition)-Trite, smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read Paleo Conservative journals like AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a FULL 8 years under Clinton as well) is challenged by BOTH those on the left AND the right.It is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis. TRY reading "HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE?" by SCHAEFFER or DALRYMPLE's "OUR CULTURE ,WHAT's LEFT of IT" for a more intelligent and cogent analysis
1	More relevant today than ever. When I watch this movie it's as if the writer in 1975 had a pre-cognizance of what was going to happen in 2003. Pay particular attention to the last scene between Redford and Robertson. The words Robertson says are more relevant today that they were then. Besides meaning and relevance it's also a great action thriller, with a little romance. Faye Dunaway is at her most beautiful and Redford his most attractive. They both give truly amazing performances as ordinary people accidently caught up in monumental intrigues they know nothing of.
1	all right, good one then... akira kurosawa's masterpiece gets the 'do-over' from criterion. this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film, absolutely no question about it. i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras, let alone watch the movie all the way through. i'm one of those frame-by-frame, shot-by-shot viewers. i have seen the film several times over the years, mostly on criterion's original release of the film, this is going way back. if you have never seen this film don't waste your time with any other version than this one. it does not disappoint. KYDU
0	SKIP THIS THIS IS NOT J-HORROR Oh man, this is really (...)!!! I rent this DVD,I REALLY, REALLY glad, I rented it didn't buy this Crap! I thought this series of GHOST stories come from J-Horrors. Would be real shocking and scary,Gory. That's what u expected from j-horror!!..It was looks like our TWILLIGT ZONE series was made for TV have silly special effects..Kind of slow pasted stories little silly suspense here and there..Just lame! Wasn't scary at all!. . Definitely SKIP this, It just wasting time and money, I was wondering another review from "THOM" Did he really SAW this movie or someone told him about it? ..He gave this movie 5 STARS????? LOL!! U TRIPPIN DUDE!!.B
1	A Parable -- Facing Death ** Spoiler Alert! ** By the time most people got to the theater to see this film, or rented it, they already knew the ship and its crew would be dead in less than two hours. Surprisingly, this does not diminish from the film's power. Even on second or third viewing, the film never delivers a moment that is false, maudlin, or sentimental. The plot is not what keeps people engaged during this film. It is the issue. How do people face death? In this film, the people are the captain and crew of the boat. They know commercial fishing is a difficult and dangerous job, even when the weather is good. The weather is not good. The men need the money. They go out even though they know they will meet a storm. They are used to risking their lives every day. The storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men, and kills them. They struggle to save their own lives. They fail. When they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat, they face death squarely. They talk, briefly, and unsentimentally, about things they will not be able to do, people they will miss. The stark, plainness of the acting achieves a powerful effect. At the beginning of the film, the viewer meets the crew. On repeated viewings, the film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial. The men are solid, working people. There is no sappy foreshadowing. The director deserves kudos for maintaining iron-fisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy. The viewer will learn a lot about meteorology. The special effects are indistinguishable from live action. All the actors, including George Clooney, maintain a stoic engagement with life, and they struggle to live, with no appeal to our pity, until they are dead. The Perfect Storm is more than a film. It is a parable. One could invest in such a classic work of art
0	Fock You! This movie was AWESOME! Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis! DeNiro, AWESOME! Hoffman, AWESOME! Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho! I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene! This was Hollywood movie watching heaven! This film should have won some Academy Awards! I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated! This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard! Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about! Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies? Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently
1	Not for the Little Ones -- a review of Leapfrog 'Storybook Factory' In the Product Description it says that this video is for the 3 to 6 year old age range, but having children in that range myself, I can tell you that this is incorrect. For unlike the other Leapfrog videos, this one is really meant for older children who are either on the verge of reading, or who have just started reading. I say this from observation of my son (3.5) and daughter (5.5) and their friends. Those of them that are almost reading, or who are sounding out short words and sentences, understand the importance of punctuation and 'get' the songs and the points of the story which emphasize inflection and reading naturally (chunking). For the younger ones it just passes over their heads which is perfectly understandable since they haven't a good idea of what sentences and paragraph structure is all about. Five Stars. It's short, but for the right kids it's an invaluable tool for teaching about story structure and reading. Young children will watch Lily, Tad and the gang, but don't expect them to learn much. But buy this video. If you have the other videos (which are amazing) go ahead and get this one to go along with them. When the time is right, your child will just absorb this information like they did their letters
1	Bend it Like Beckham Scores lots of Goals with me BRILLIANT! Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you. This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift. I think they'll thank you for it. Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL. I love this movie; this is how movies should be made. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen. The entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about. Look for Keira Knightley in a supporting role. A Shawn James five star essential movie. Definitely get this movie along with the wonderful Muriel's Wedding, a great Australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey.
1	This Is a Long Ride, Ese... Are You Ready? BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT (a.k.a. "Bound by Honor") is a bit of a surprise. While it incorporates many of the predictable elements of a barrio crime film, it is also just different enough to keep you hanging in there. For example, this film has the best location shots of East L.A. I think I've ever seen, and the whole movie has the look of authenticity. This is no illusion; the prison scenes were filmed in San Quentin, and there are only eight actors used for them. This adds interest as you try to spot the "real" actors behind bars. (Hint: The convict who looks like Billy Bob Thornton IS Billy Bob Thornton.) Another one of the non-cons is Hispanic poet Jimmy Santiago Baca; he plays the member of La Onda with a heavily pruned mustache. Baca co-wrote this screenplay, and it's clear that he's unaccustomed to the traditional story arcs of mainstream film. That's not to the project's detriment, but it does mean that you have to sit through the first half-hour of the movie before its promise starts to be revealed. In other words, this movie's bad acting and melodramatic music score are at their worst in the early going. Perhaps this is intentional; BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT means it's hard to get in the gang, and it's not easy bailing from it either; the same is true for the viewer watching this movie. And just like joining a gang, you're making a real commitment here, as the film is well over three hours long. (In its original form, it was well over FIVE hours long!) SIDELIGHT: I've never heard "ese" (pronounced "ess-ay") so many times in my life; be sure to have the subtitles on to understand the Spanglish slang.
1	Fun fun fun! Glad I bought it! After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to give this DVD a chance. It was the first dance workout DVD that I purchased and I'm really having a hard time finding another one that is as much fun. (I just ordered her African/Latin one and hope it's as good!) The biggest plus is that it keeps me interested and going back for more. I do this workout at least twice a week and find myself feeling like I actually exercised without trying. I HATE to exercise, so it's definitely a selling factor that I actually look forward to doing this. If you aren't a dancer, it will be a smidgen difficult at first, but you KNOW that if you keep doing it that you'll catch on. It's not as hopeless as some of the other ones that I bought.... and helped me discover that I've got no future in hip-hop! MaDonna has a good personality and teaches you without you even knowing that you're learning choreography. I learned some fun moves and my teenage relatives gave me "cool points" when I pulled out the routine while we were dancing around the livingroom :-) I would definitely recommend this DVD
1	It is original This movie presents a real moral dilemna..should students who have always been thought of as losers take a chance and cheat. The teacher has the toughest decision to make-weather to let his students cheat and what to do if they get caught. Jeff Daniels plays the part well-showing how he is torn-wanting his students to get recognition and wanting to teach them right from wrong. This movie has moral questions that we all face
0	Based On Conspiracy Theories Rather Than Historical Evidence In a very convoluted plot, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou) are chased through the streets of Paris and London by the French police and a crazed religious fanatic named Silas. It's your typical Hollywood action-thriller in most respects. Yes, it's silly and unrealistic. But if that's all there were to it I might go along with the "it's only a movie" argument. Unfortunately, this movie is also full of ideas, ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts. As an atheist, I certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in Christian history. For example, the Inquisition, the witch burnings and the Crusades are all mentioned. Yet these actual historical events are only brushed over. Instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about Christianity. For example, it states that not only were Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day. They also portray a secret Catholic society that is involved in murder plots, strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities. It's completely fair to challenge the Church on its grave errors. For example, the shameful Inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people. I also disagree with the Vatican's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control. However, the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-Catholic bigotry. It's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against Jews to justify brutal acts of anti-Semitism, including the Holocaust. No, I don't think it's likely that the "Da Vinci Code" will lead to the mass execution of Catholics. But any time a particular group is scapegoated it's a potential source of trouble. Basically, "The Da Vinci Code" is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence. But, unfortunately, as P.T. Barnum said, "there's a sucker born every minute," and some people are going to believe this nonsense. History is a complex subject and I have no respect for people, whether they be the book's writer, Dan Brown, or the film's director, Ron Howard, who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck. This is garbage. Don't waste your time
1	Interesting short film for any Disney or animation buff This is a very well done documentary that offers some insight into the rise and (currently) dramatic fall of Disney animation. If you follow Disney news at all, the documentary does not reveal anything that you probably do not already know. What the documentary does do, however, is put faces and personal stories to the facts. My only complaint was that it was a little short. It would have been nice to see what the animator's "post Disney" plans were
0	i love jet li's movies except this one ok i love action films except this one... the previews fooled me really badly, i thought jet li would somehow take down all the arrows like how the previews showed it...but no, he dies. that is a tragedy. if ur marketing a film and setting an expectation, make sure u meet it otherwise people get angry, like me
1	Murder, She Wrote: Season Three It took me only two weeks to watch all 22 episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" - The Complete Third Season. And my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two: just more mystery fun with Angela Lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver Jessica Fletcher. Familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three, including recent "Syriana" Oscar winner George Clooney, past Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine ("The Poseidon Adventure") and Martin Balsam ("Psycho"), "Friends" alum Courtney Cox Arquette, "Brady Bunch" veterans Florence Henderson and Barry Williams, veteran comic Buddy Hackett, and "Naked Gun" star Leslie Nielsen. Other guest stars include: Gloria Stuart ("Titanic"), G.W. Bailey ("Police Academy"), Tess Harper ("Tender Mercies"), Jessica Walter ("Arrested Development"), Hayley Mills ("The Parent Trap"), Bill Macy ("Maude"), Genie Francis ("General Hospital"), Dinah Manoff ("Empty Nest"), and Harry Morgan ("M*A*S*H"). Three stars from the "Star Trek" TV shows turned up for guest appearences: George Takei (the original "Star Trek" series), LeVar Burton ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), and Kate Mulgrew ("Star Trek: Voyager"). Erin Moran, best known for playing Joannie on the popular '70s sitcom "Happy Days", guest starred in the third episode of season three titled "Unfinished Business", which reunited her with "Happy Days" co-star Tom Bosley, who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of "Murder, She Wrote" as Amos Tupper, the sheriff of Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine (I've very much enjoyed Bosley's appearences on "Murder, She Wrote" as well as William Windom's reoccuring appearences as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt). And in an interesting scenario, Tom Selleck and John Hillerman turn up in their "Magnum P.I." roles as part of a cross-over episode, with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of "Magnum P.I." (which was in its seventh season) and concluding with an episode of "Murder, She Wrote" (episode #8 to be exact). That episode of "Magnum P.I." is featured as a bonus on season three of "Murder, She Wrote". The "Magnum P.I."/"Murder, She Wrote" cross-over episodes (titled "Novel Connection" and "Magnum on Ice") were a favorite of mine. Other great episodes from season three include: "Death Stalks the Big Top" parts 1 and 2, "Unfinished Business", "Obituary For A Dead Anchor", "The Corpse Flew First Class", "Crossed Up", "Simon Says, Color Me Dead", "No Laughing Murder", "No Accounting For Murder", and "Murder, She Spoke". "Murder, She Wrote" season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime, and Lansbury is wonderful as usual. I'm sure the fun will continue with season four!
1	Loved this show This is a must for mystery fans who love to think. It is in the league of Columbo and McMillan and Wife. Now if they will release Hardcastle and McCormick on DVD, I will be a happy person
0	Don't waste ur money Buying this would not make sense if you A. Bought Batman The Animated Series: Volume One or B. Batman TAS The Legend Begins. If you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by Warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have 2 and if ur that rare case of ones who bought BOTH A. and B. then you would have 3 Christmas' with Joker. Now I would urge you to buy Volume One and later 2 then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both DVD's. Be safe and read before you buy
1	Vietnam Era Movie This is one of my son's favorite movies and he lost the VHS tape. This is based on a true story of a military disk jockey in Vietnam. He doesn't follow the rules and has conflict with his disgruntled commanding officer and gets involved with the local people. One of Robyn William's better works
0	Fantastic musical scores, acting production good but uneven and busy Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of "show don't tell" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene "announcing" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do "too much" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of scene effects, ranging from surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks. Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved.
0	Copycat movie of the Australian movie "The Adventures Of Pricilla, Queen Of The Desert" This movie is nothing but a copy of the Australian movie "The Adventures Of Pricilla, Queen Of The Desert". Typical!!! Just like the original English BBC series of "The Office" which was copied and remade in the USA. Stop stealing ideas from other countries
1	cool punishment scene the guy shirtless, tied up, abs muscles so vulnerables to let the punisher to TORTURE this guy until he cant almost breath and cry for mercy...just an upper stomach being beaten to make this guy suffer a pain he will never forget..
1	Excellent workout My piano teacher first introduced me to Pilates and I do some kind of pilates workout almost every day now. I absolutely love to do pilates, unlike regular exercise. (I do NOT love to exercise. NO running, no weight lifting, no biking, ect.) I never felt the need to exercise because I am small and naturally very thin, but I started to realize that even though I'm thin, I was not very strong and in terrible shape. I started to do the exercises on the beginners DVD and it was much harder than I expected. I woke up the next day with sore muscles! After a time, my abs started to get stronger and my awareness of what was going on in my body and the way I was breathing was much more alert. I also really like the alternate workout - the 'energy boost' - a fifteen minutes energy workout. It is absolutely perfect for days when I have a lot going on, or if I just don't feel like doing pilates for an hour. I can just do the quick workout, and I'm set for the day. Now I'm hooked on pilates and although I'm sad to say it is the only exercise I do, at least I'm in better shape than I was
1	the blood of one's brothers An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine. GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could. True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place. The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself. But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die. Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances. Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain. 'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'. The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves. This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest
0	what horrific garbage! while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die? have i gone to horrible movie hell?" you see i was trapped in a theater. it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat. the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape. in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow. but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo)
0	Making Love Scene Completely Cut I saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and I definately remember the Love Making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness. But the scene is completely gone in the DVD, as well as the kiss. Now why in the world would they cut that out!!!??? That was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time, it was on the cutting edge. One star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie "Making Love"
1	Wow! What a fun movie! A fun movie all around! Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke are definately the standout stars! Eventhough it's basically a romance movie it still rocks the house! I looooove the gen X 90's feeling it has to it. It really took me back. Lalaine's desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson, too. I also think that she picked the best one in the end. But, the best thing about Reality Bites is it's great filming location. H-TOWN! Makes me sooooo proud to be from here
0	This is not Alexander Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him. We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his "true" character and nature is at best just hypothetcal conjecture. No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves. Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biograpies of Alexander. From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the more scholarly Robin Lane Fox's "Alexander the Great" there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have. Certainly the life of Alexander is a msystery since there is virtualy nothing know about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film. For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the "Battle of Chaeronea" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie. Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer. Obviously, his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but "give me a break". This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him "The Great". Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless. And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct. And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guess work at that. Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was intrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace. While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted. Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros. He was also allowed to refered to as a "man" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a "man". At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field. It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving. The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander. A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better. And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in "Road Runner" cartoons. One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie: On his march back "home", he encountered the "Mallians", a fierce and warring nation. An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving. Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up. Three othr men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him. The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements. The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but alexander jumped into the fort and attacked. He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians. The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there. That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psyhological meanderings that were a complete bore. Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military stratagey and tactics, a philosopher, muscian, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the "grand tradition". Maybe Peter Jackson should make a movie about Alexander. I'm sure he could get it "right".
1	two good flicks a previous reviewer trashed pi, why i cannot comprehend, its blend of schizoid paranoia and underground religious themes leads to an engrossing and disturbing film, well worth seeing by anyone with an interest in philosophy, psychological study, and religion. some of the acting is weak, but then again it was a low budget film so one must forgive that aspect of it. however the direction more than makes up for it..........ps his new movie requim for a dream is also a must see....
0	A TRIBUTE A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration." That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere
1	Not as bad as some of these reviews say I've seen all 3 Cube movies, and although this is not the best of the 3 it is a good movie. The theory behind a hypercube (yes they exisit in mathematical theory) is accurate and suprisingly all the equations that are written out are acutal formule and equations for hypercubes. And that adds to this movies mystique. True the 1st movie was far better. This movie explores more about the charactes though. Each character had either was connected with the hypercube or was placed in it for a specific task
0	Pieces Of a Puzzle Ju-On the grudge is about a horrific murder that develops an un-rested spirit which rages in a small suburban house in Japan. The movie constructs itself similar to a puzzled storyline as the movie developed through numerous storylines of the varying characters. For the most part, viewers can easily be confused in the flick, or bored, as it may seem a bit redundant. I thought the movie was well written and interesting in theory. In practice, the movie felt never-ending, and as it drew to a close, i felt betrayed. The movie was unfulfilled, as it never really explained a lot of questions I held at the end. One question that leaves me wondering is questioning whether it is a Japanese custom to enter a house when no one answers. For those interested in Asian horror, try Tale of Two Sisters. This Korean film has great cinematography and story line. It will leave you on edge and taken back at its close.
0	Good Movie for under $3.00 I must say, this isn't the best of Ralph Bakshi. I bet the soundtrack would be worth more then the movie. There is some great songs, however there is no PLOT, there is no Reasoning, and there is no Action. Like Always, great animation by Bakshi, but I know for sure the Bakshi's team could had really done better. 5 stars for the music, 2 stars for the film. I wasn't upset for spending the 3 dollars
0	This Lady Snowblood Doesn't Fly The Princess Blade is a homage to an infinitely better movie, 1973's Lady Snowblood. It's not like they try to hide that fact - it's a homage, not a rip-off. The Japanese name of both films, Shurayuki-hime, is identical, and the two main characters even have the same name, Yuki. In Japanese, "Shura" is a Buddhist term very like "Hell" or "netherworld," a place of violence and carnage. "Yuki" mean "snow" and is a common girl's name. "Hime" means "princess" or "lady." "Shurayuki-hime" is also a play on "Shirayuki-hime," the Japanese name for Snow White. All this according to the movie notes on the Lady Snowblood DVD. In Lady Snowblood, in Meiji Japan the titular character is the child of a woman whose husband and son are murdered by a band of thugs. After the murders, the wife is raped and tortured by the killers for three days. Surviving that ordeal, she dedicates herself to tracking and killing the people responsible. She offs the first one but is then captured and jailed. Dying in prison in childbirth, she charges - some would say curses - her infant daughter to finish the job when she's old enough. For what it is, this is an extraordinarily well done film. Even with all the extreme violence and second-rate actors overdoing their death throes as they spurt buckets of fake blood we'd expect from a Seventies Japanese samurai flick, there are also moments in Lady Snowblood that are eerily beautiful. In The Princess Blade, in that unspecified near-future time so beloved of low-budget sci-fi, Yuki's mother is the leader of a gang of assassins. Betrayed by one of her own, she's also tortured for three days, but in this case doesn't survive the experience. The daughter, unaware how her mother died - she's only two years old at the time - becomes a member of the gang herself. Not until she's almost 20 does she discover the gang leader is also her mother's murderer. After trying and failing to kill him, she runs for her life and the movie proceeds from there. If I may be allowed to seemingly digress for a moment: I believe that most people - unless they absolutely hate a particular type of movie - will enjoy any film, of any genre, as long as it's well done. Look at all the people not previously fans of anime who loved Ghost In the Shell. The Princess Blade is low-budget, hyper-violent, Japanese chop-socky. It's well enough done that if you're already a fan of such movies, you'll probably enjoy it. However, unlike Lady Snowblood, The Princess Blade is not well enough done to have crossover appeal, i.e. it just won't do it for people not already predisposed to like this sort of film. If you're a genre fan, I'd say of The Princess Blade, go for it. If not, and you just have an idle interest in watching a good low-budget Japanese flick with a sword-wielding female assassin as the main character, I suggest passing on The Princess Blade and watching Lady Snowblood instead (now available in an absolutely superb DVD transfer, by the way). You'll enjoy the experience immensely more
0	In one word... Stupid! This has to be THE WORST western movie ever. I do believe the actors that appeared in this movie did it just to have the chance to work together, because honestly I can't find a logical reason why someone like Gene Hackman would actually appear in such a ridiculous flick. Follow my advice on this one DO NOT BUY
0	Fair To Middling Scott Western Ten Wanted Men, as many of Randolph Scott's other fifties Westerns, suffers in comparison to the Budd Boetticher-directed Westerns featuring Scott. Once again, as with some of the non-Boetticher Scott films, this movie has a great cast, interesting plot features, and lots of potential, but the payoff is not as great as it should be. Scott plays a rancher who takes in a young Mexican woman who is being relentlessly pursued by Richard Boone, who is a rancher coveting Scott's vast land holdings. Scott's generosity toward the woman gives Boone the perfect excuse to start trouble, and he hires a gang of thugs, including Leo Gordon and Lee Van Cleef, to terrorize and try to kill Scott, Scott's brother, and Scott's nephew. Boone, who is one of the alltime great Western actors, seems out of place as a desperate cad who has to hire other men to do his dirty work. Also, this film contains many elements of Scott's other movies, and rather than seeming fond and comfortable, they seem tired and warmed over. Scott is Scott, and that says a lot. He was often criticized for his perceived lack of acting ability, but there was a humanity and honesty about his characters that drew audiences to him then, and still works today, making him one of the most appealing American actors. But Ten Wanted Men would have been better served by Boetticher, Raoul Walsh, or another capable Western director
0	Yawn. I saw this film years ago on a crappy videotape, so before writing my review I decided to give the DVD a chance and you know what? The picture quality on the DVD isn't much better (if any) than the videotape and the story still sucks. Yea, Vanity gets naked but it's done in such an unsexy way that it's well unsexy. She looked sexier with clothes on in THE LAST DRAGON. The story if you can call it that is about Vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend, one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together. Soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him. The boyfriend is jealous and a war breaks out between the two, the gorilla and the man that is, with each kidnapping the girl away from the other and raping her.
1	Great classic! This wonderful classic is worth watching again and again. My sixteen year old son watched it for the first time and was very impressed (a pleasant surprise-since he's not hip on old movies). He thought the film would be so out of date as far as stunts, special effects, etc. that he'd be bored to tears, but this film has stood up to the test of time, perhaps because it was ahead of its time. I never get tired of watching O'Toole's performance as the brash, impressionable young Lawrence who strives to help keep Arabia in the hands of the Arabs, despite the wishes of his British commanders. At one point Lawrence develops a 'God complex', only to be brought back to the reality that he's just and ordinary man with weaknesses. This realization doesn't stop him from attempting to do something extraordinary... Chrissy K. McVay - Autho
1	ONE OF THE CLASSICS I see some people saying this movie was not all it was said to have been. But you definately had to have seen this during the early 80's to relate to it and it was only meant for the people that actually lived in this time era. For most of you seeing it for the first time in 2006, it wont make sense to you and seem outdated. If your recollection of Hip Hop is N.W.A. or the likes, you will know nothing about this movie or relate to it in anyway - this is raw Hip Hop
0	Not As Great As All The Hype I hear all the time as i read hip hop mags and articles all about how great Wild Style IS THE BEST HIP HOP movie ever. Well I purchased it at the first of the year and guess what it cant't hold Beat Street and Breakin or Krush Grooves jockstrap. I think the movie Rappin or even the not so get Lorenzo Lamas Hip Hop movie Body Rock has moments that's even better than Wild Style. People who read this will probably say what gives you the right to think you know so much well me being 30 years old you can do the math. Thats around when the Hip Hop movement started. So if your a movie collector. Go ahead and buy it but if you want a good movie to watch. Then purchase somthing else.
0	The most silent of all movies! Given the fact that this film has no soundtrack, I can only give it two stars. It is a bit too silent to enjoy
0	A Silly Sexual Farce Ok! So it had a Swiss cheese plot. That's not so unusual for a soft core move is it? I've seen my share of soft porn movies and usually, not always but usually, what was lacking in a storyline was made up by the fact, that numerous gorgeous gals were romping around in the altogether, doing stimulating things to make you forget, there was even supposed to be a plot. Yes, Bacchanalles had a lot of nudity and a lot of make believe sex but except for the star, Joelle Coeur, who was genuinely a looker, most of the rest, looked like the girls, that get better looking at closing time. I know everybody can't always be fussy about the women they make love to, but certainly, they can be fussy about the ones they watch women make love. Right? So what do we have? We have a plot, which, believe it of not, could have been the inspiration for "Eyes Wide Shut". Oops! I've already said too much! Bacchanalles Sexuelles, meaning `sexual festival`, features a generally unattractive cast of amateurish, stiff (not that way) actors and actresses, performing mostly sans clothing, in a fairly low budget, thirty year old erotic, French movie, with subtitles, where you sometimes have to choose between reading the subtitles, or watching the action. Still interested? Read on. Valerie, the one bright spot in the movie, played by Joelle Coeur, who along with her friend Sophia, (Brigette De Borghese) is apartment sitting for her cousin, when Sophia, unbeknownst to Valerie is kidnapped by a sex cult. Valerie is awakened in the morning by Fred, whom Sophia apparently invited over without Valerie's knowledge. Fred forces Valerie to have sex, which she ultimately enjoys. In the meantime The culprits realize they have kidnapped the wrong girl, for they really needed Valerie and not Sophia for their evil purposes, so the head seductress, (my expression) sends one of the cultists, pretending to be a maid, back to the apartment to garner information on Valerie, where she promptly ends up in a bathtub with Valerie and Fred before taking their ma`nage a trois to the small (double) bed in the bedroom, where the action continues for what seems like hours. Eventually the real maid shows up and Fred and Valerie, the super sleuths (that`s sleuths as in detectives, not sluts as in ....) that they are, start to unravel the mystery of Sophia. But not until we have a half dozen more sex scenes including the grand finale, an orgy of cultists. WOW! Conclusion I suppose this movie in a sense was an orgy. An excess of mediocrity. It also had a sense of absurdity. This may have been purposeful, which, it was would somewhat mitigate against the amateurish feeling of the film, However, that said, for all it`s weaknesses, it wasn't that bad. Like I said the story was full of holes and except for two ladies, the femmes were closer to homely than attractive, or they were hard and used looking. That said, their bodies were decent and the were enough (probably a dozen) sex scenes, that I wouldn't stop anyone from watching this bomb. Another point should make is that being filmed over thirty years ago and in Europe, the girls were unshaved, including in some cases, under the arms. Also the color quality was a little flat.
1	apocolypto Apocolypto is definately a violent movie. Yet, somehow, the movie would not show the brutality and the horror of the Aztec civilization if it watered down this part. Instead, this movie is very real, and in Mel Gibson's way, has a powerful message to tell. And in the final scenes of the movie, I could see how the 'want more' of the Aztec pursuing the young man could lead to corruption, and the ultimate death. This movie is shocking, but behind all the violence and gore, there is a message that anyone can see, and despite the "R" rating of this movie, this movie is definately worth watching. I thought it was extremely well done
0	A BIG disappointment I was hoping that the 2nd season would be an improvement from the 1st season, but sadly it is not. I am a major batman fan and grew up on Batman: The Animated Series, Batman/Superman Adventures, Batman Beyond, and Justice League. The previous cartoons had great scripts and in depth charactors that made it exciting to watch....I am finding that I am going off topic. The batman is not the cartoon for die hard fans of batman over the age of 3. The show is written for a much younger audience that does not need a captivating script and deep charactors. Instead this show focuses on the action sequences and way too many witty comebacks. I have to say this, but what the heck is the Penguin doing when he is fighting batman? Has he traveled the world and studied numerous martial arts? Since when can he jump from tree branch to tree branch and swing around and kick batman
0	Don't waste your money This DVD is a huge waste of money. The whole thing is poorly put together: bad music and worse girls. Just take a look at what the cover offers -- one word, BUSTED. The first two Hip Hop Honeys DVDs justified their purchase ... this one sucks
1	The War of the Roses I enjoyed The War of the Roses, so much so I loaned my DVD to someone and was waiting for it to be returned so that I could watch it again. Excellent movie
0	Shallow characters, bizarre story That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating! On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it
0	problem with ordering I loved Angel Heart. I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon. I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version. However, it was also rated R. It looks like I will have to buy it here locally. The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone. If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version
1	Forgotten Anderson gem Joe 90 is, to American viewers, one of Gerry Anderson's best-kept secrets, as, apart from two made-for-cable episode compilations that aired in the early 80s, it has never been broadcast in the USA. This is a shame as this series contains some of the best model work of the entire Supermarionation canon. The series is pure fantasy -- just think what the DYFS would do if it found out that a nine-year-old adopted child were acting as a &quot;most special agent,&quot; carrying a gun, driving tanks full of explosives, etc.The series is a great deal of fun, and the attention to detail is quite frankly amazing. If one were to watch the series from a distance, one could easily be forgiven in thinking that it has real actors in actual normal-sized sets. Although contemporary publicity material claims the series is set about 50 years in the future, ie in 2038, the fashions, vehicles, etc. are firmly from the 1960s, and easily stands up to the best that British television from this era had to offer. Just ignore the fact that the main protagonist is about 2 feet tall and you'll find the series highly enjoyable.Oh, and it's got a super theme tune, and the remastering is, as George Orwell might say, double-plus-excellent. Carlton in the UK has removed practically every flaw in the original prints. They are pristine, and look superb on my 32&quot; TV
0	Pure dookey. I want my 78 minutes back! Spare yourself - don't buy this cruddy film, and don't waste your time watching it. Think of all the wonderful things you could do in 78 minutes. Call me old fashioned, but I have this little hang up about a movie having a plot and having structure. This is a desperate attempt to be artsy, which simply comes off as a bunch of film students fooling around trying to do something weird. Endless repeated scenes with small variations, a "mystery" that really isn't much of one. Courtney Cox wearing awful clothes and ugly glasses and endless closeups of her looking gaunt and haggard to the point where I wanted to offer her a sandwich or something. Dreary acting, dreary music. Creakingly obvious attempts to be artistic by shooting portions of the film in bilious green or dreary blue. The same material recycled endlessly to the point where I hated all the characters, and didn't give a damn what happened to any of them. Making a film without a single likeable character is a big boo-boo. If the audience doesn't care, they might not hang around until the end, and if they do, they'll feel as if they've wasted their time. As Hannibal Lecter would say, tedious, very tedious
1	i don't get it I don't understand. How is it that so many people thought 1984 the movie was a masterpiece and yet they didn't give this great film the time of day. This movie is as good as 1984 (the movie) was bad. This is a perfect example of what communism really is, a good idea that could only work in a perfect world because hay, people (and animals apparently) are corrupt. Theirs a reason they say absolute power corrupts absolutely. People are selfish, and this is why communism must always fail, because people don't like to share and like being forced to share even less. This is one hell of a movie. Not perfect, but way above the [...] fest of a movie 1984 was. If you love Gorge Orwell than get this movie
0	zhang yimou Rating - 5 stars for the film, of course, but zero stars for the copy. Thank you so much for the information on the new editions of Ju Dou, Qui Ju. (Razor). I have cancelled my order. I will keep reading your commments and continue my search for these films (Red Sorgum also). And will let you know if I find anything. Thanks to Amazon for letting us give and receive helpful opinions. Looking for excellent copies of RED LANTERNS (allright edition), TO LIVE (MGN), and SHANGHAI TRIAD (Shanghai film studio) ? You can get them in France at www. FNAC.com. They are about 20 Euros each which is about 17$. Of course you will have to pay postage, and perhaps customs, but they are worth it. From new copies and brilliant colors. Only TO LIVE has English sub titles. All three have French subtitles. You also will need a DVD player which can read zone2 disques. FOSSES-ST-B
1	The best baseball movie of all time. This is no Hollywood baseball movie. This is the real deal. Exquisite colors and poetic comments from those who played baseball the way it should be played- as a game
1	Barbie as Rupunzel. My 5 year old is a Barbie junkie. She has all of the movies. This one is probably her least favorite, but she has still watched it quite a few times since Christmas.
1	New line from the Criterion Collection! As a film programmer & movie fan, I'm VERY psyched about the new Eclipse line from the Criterion Collection. What better start than these early titles by Bergman. It looks like more great things to come, so keep your eye out. Even without the many extras, etc, the Eclipse catalog will finally make available many rare films that have been waiting for DVD release. Thank you, Criterion
0	A great film given the basest possible DVD treatment from Fox Lorber Most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning Srdjan Dragojevic film at select film festivals in the U.S. have not forgotten its clarity, its anger, and its power. The movie was passed up for theatrical distribution, although it was readily available on VHS and now on DVD from Fox Lorber. This DVD is a bust in every thinkable way, although Fox Lorber was obviously aiming very low. The phrase "bare-bones" is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary, dismissive releases, lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant. This DVD does contain a trailer, but the trailer, sadly, looks better than the feature. "Bare-bones" would have been fine, but watching this disc is torture. It's obviously a quickie transfer from the VHS -- I could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout, poor audio balance (with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo) poor contrast, a muddy, dark image, burnt-in subtitles, and so forth. Fox Lorber were long the scourge of the art-film DVD market, and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc. New Yorker and Wellspring (formerly Winstar) are guilty of similar offenses

1	Ingratiating Comedy Focuses on a Circle of Vacationing Married Friends Twenty-five years since its initial release, this 1981 comedy from Alan Alda, its director, writer and nominal star, still holds up pretty well. In fact, I just saw Norman Jewison's 2001 film, "Dinner with Friends", which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age. Using Vivaldi's familiar string concertos as a transitional device, Alda's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season, consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year. It's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax, but it all seems to fit the contours of the story. Jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends, while his wife Kate, a magazine editor, is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with Jack's constant emotional insulation. Danny is a neurotic, penny-pinching dentist married to Claudia, an artist with the hot temper of her Italian roots. Nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife Anne, a housewife frozen by her self-doubts. It is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends. The group starts out with a spring fishing trip when Nick confides to Jack about his need for a divorce, followed by a Caribbean summer boat trip when Nick brings his new nubile girlfriend Ginny, a wide-eyed stewardess. The fall has them visiting their kids in college, and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to Ginny much to the chagrin of the wives. The last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged, especially as Ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics. The acting is solid. Alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as Jack, and a wisely cast Carol Burnett is actually pretty subtle as Kate. These two were such huge TV icons in the 1970's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant. As the most comic pair, Rita Moreno and Jack Weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like Fred and Ethel Mertz redux. Broadway actor Len Cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free, while Sandy Dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected Anne. Bess Armstrong plays Ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance. The story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that Ginny will become more integral to the group, but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty. Alda doesn't quite have Woody Allen's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition, but the film generates a good time while it lasts. The 2005 DVD has no extras
0	Strange Movie.... Very bizzare movie! Not for kids or anyone who is prudish! Can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it
1	Stargate SG-1 series This is the best Sci-fi series ever. I am a huge fan of the gate. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I already have the first few seasons in the old packaging, and if I want my sets to match I am going to have to sell them and re-buy them in the new thin packs. But with the price break now, It's definately more affordable. Plus it will be nice to have a set half the size!!! I can use the room
0	Karl Rove Would Be Proud So I finally got around to watching "Michael Moore Hates America", the DVD that was financed by Richard Mellon Scaife, with the help of a few right-wing think tanks. Also appearing is Penn Jillette, a rabid psychiatrist, some NRA staffers, pundits, more think-tankers, and a number of pissed-off vets. While Wilson comes off as tolerant (backhandedly) with regards to Moore's techniques, when it comes to his ideas it's almost completely one-sided in that that nearly everything is a rebuttal of the man's social commentary. There's a lot of well-balanced, average centrist people that get innocently sucked into this mess, but the number of instances that hint that maybe, just maybe Moore's got a few points in his films (as opposed to everything being mere alarmist rhetoric manufactured by taking things out of context) are exceedingly few. Center-right moderates are likely to feel soothed and smug by the whole presentation, so the movie caters to them very well. By far most of the examples criticized here involve Bowling For Columbine, with only a few from "Roger And Me" and none from "Fahrenheit 911" although the movie was released. In one scene Wilson attempts to push-poll a woman who saw "Fahrenheit" the day before: "How would knowing that Mr. Moore's selective editing of the facts in Fahrenheit in order to support false conclusions affect your enjoyment of the film?" On a social level, the film is a veritable ode to Republican framing, i.e.: There Is No Economic Divide, Corporations Don't Hurt Us, We Can All Be Successful If We Work Hard Enough, Criticizing the Leadership means you Hate America, etc., etc... and oh yeah, one actually guy goes on to say that we don't need Michael Moore because we already get fair perspectives on all sides from the major news media, amazingly lumping present-day Fox, CNN and pre-merger CBS-era Walter Cronkite together in the same sentence. Ultimately, the man (Michael Wilson) fails to get his interview.
1	refreshingly real Lucero tells it like it is and this documentary captures the essence of the band. It is a great portrayal of a band that is working hard (touring 250 days a year) to realize their dream of making music
1	Top TV Film! The truth shall set you free...might be a more apt title for this little 'made for TV' gem in which Jim Carrey stars in one of his first roles. 'Doing Time on Maple Drive' is a powerful drama about one family's cathartic acceptance of the truths which threaten to destroy it. On the surface, the Carters are the epitome of the 'perfect' suburban family. Three handsome children, neatly trimmed front lawn, the flag waving outside. The all-American family. The first scenes tell everything. While the Stars and Stripes hang outside the front door, Lisa Carter (Bibi Besch) polishes the family pictures as if they were sacred relics, masks of a happiness that is conspicuously absent from this family. Lisa sets the table for the arrival of their youngest son, Matt (William Mc Namara) and his bride-to-be, Allison (Lori Laughlin). Next scene and father (James Sikking) pulls up the driveway with his eldest son, Tim. The black sheep of the family, Tim is just there as a sad reminder of what he 'could have been.' He could have gone to West Point if he hadn't flunked out, if had he just done what his father had wanted him to do. And now, he is the household ghost, symbol of failure, burden to his parents. Ignored, he takes to the bottle which further alienates him from his family. His father won't even let him pass through the front door lest mom smell the stench of alcohol. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. The Carters are masters at seeing what they want to see. Denied the successful son with Tim, they place all hopes on Matt. Young and handsome, he soon plans to marry his Yale sweetheart, Allison and walk into the role of perfect child, fulfilling the wishes of his parents. And somewhat pushed to the back is the daughter, Karen (Jayne Brook). Married and theoretically 'free' from her family, she is still prisoner to her father's expectations, rather than partner to her journalist husband. He wants a child, but she's afraid her father might not approve. The film reaches its climax with skill and tension. And the clues that something is amiss are everywhere. Why isn't Tim going to be best man at Matt's wedding? And why isn't Matt's best friend from Yale being invited to the wedding? Smiles are forced, subjects are avoided and nobody listens to one another, until the outsider, Allison, refuses to join the game. By chance, she finds a love-letter from Matt addressed to his university friend,Kyle, the one strangely missing from their wedding's guest list. Not only is Matt forced to acknowledge who he is, he has to explain to his family why his bride-to-be has suddenly called off the wedding. Matt tries to escape this confrontation by nearly killing himself. Surviving the car crash, he still has to survive the even more painful crash with his family. Will the Carters survive the shattering of their wall of forced smiles, family photos, and lies? 'Doing Time on Maple Drive' does a wonderful job of dissecting the so-called 'dysfunctional family.' The perfomances are tight and convincing all across the board, especially those of William McNamara and James B. Sikking. Their father-son relationship is portrayed with power and tenderness. Carrey's performance is also tops, proving just how versatile an actor he is. My favorite though was Lori Loughlin. She managed to play the part of star-struck lover thrown a hard one brilliantly. She's fascinating to watch as she starts to doubt Matt's honesty and is forced into a truly painful decision. Ken Olin's film is a must for those of us who know the Carter's dilemma first hand. Cathartic and instructive, 'Doing Time on Maple Drive' leaves you with a guarded optimism, an affirmation that the truth can not only set us free but keep us together as well.
1	Bogart's Final Film The Harder they Fall is a hard hitting expose of the boxing racket, and a racket it is. Excellent performances by Humphrey Bogart, as a Sportwriter turned Boxing Press Agent,Rod Steiger, Edward Andrews, Nehemiah Persoff, and the always great ( and underrated ) Jan Sterling. An Excellent Screenplay by Philip Yordan, from a Budd Schulberg Novel. Mark Robson's Direction is swift. ***** Stars
1	A fabulous THE NUTCRACKER production I hate ballet. It is so boring, and I start craving dialogue after about twenty minutes. All that dancing gets so monotonous! So it was startling to watch Emilio Ardolino's film version of George Balanchine's THE NUTCRACKER (1993) on videocassette and just adore it. The sets and costumes, by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, use color to perfection. The Tschaikovsky music is glorious. And the dancing, by the New York Ballet, is outstanding. I could even follow the story with just Susan Cooper's minimal narrative read by Kevin Kline. It is a great ensemble cast, and Macauley Culkin fits in nicely as the Nutcracker Prince. Bart Robinson Cook as Godfather Drosselmeier is magnificent, and newcomer Jessica Lynn Cohen is enchanting as Marie. I clearly don't have a lot of experience in stage NUTCRACKER's, or any live ballet. A NUTCRACKER expert may pan it for something. Leonard Maltin asininely called it "much too stagey"! Leonard, they call it filmed ballet! Of course, it is stagey! And this 1993 production is as good as ballet gets for me. As someone at NEWSWEEK says on the front of the videocassette box, this is "like having the best seats anyone ever had for THE NUTCRACKER." It is an enthralling plum pudding of a Christmas present for viewers of all ages, especially dance lovers.

1	This Is What Great Looks Like From the original Steinbeck story to the Horton Foote screen adaptation to the lush cinematography and amazing performances, Gary Sinise's Of Mice And Men is film perfection. There is a terrible sense of inevitability present from the very beginning of this film; we know that fate will not be kind to Lennie. But despite his slow march to tragedy we are transfixed by the elegant simplicity of the telling. Sinise uses his knowledge of theatre to pare this classic story to the bone. Malkovich, always willing to get lost in a part no matter how bizarre or extreme, doesn't act Lennie, he inhabits him. Watching his childlike behavior and listening to his repetitive monologues we understand completely why George loves him as he does and simultaneously finds him thoroughly maddening. Malkovich owns this role for all time, I feel badly for every actor attempting it from now on. Extreme roles, like Lennie, allow actors lots of room to show off while simultaneously providing margin for error. Sinise, as George, has the hardest duty and comes through with a quiet performance that is nothing short of stunning. Every aspect of his complex relationship with Lennie is revealed almost inadvertently, hope, bitterness, anger, protectiveness, and pride to name just a few. As director he has stitched together all the elements of this film into an organic whole, no false notes. As director directing himself he simply inserts his own performance into a complete vision, his embodiment of George is generous - not self-serving. The brilliance of Malkovich and Sinise should not obscure a host of wonderful supporting performances. Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian) is excellent, Joe Morton is terrific as always, Casey Siemaszko brings real malevolence as only he can, John Terry is thoroughly believable as a crew boss, and Sherilyn Fenn is exactly on point as the player who loses control of the game. Simply put, Of Mice And Men is what happens on those rare occasions when absolutely everything goes right.
1	Really good movie While I am not a Richard Gere fan, I have to say this is a really good movie. A loving wife has an affiar with a french stranger. Her husband eventually finds out and has his revenge, but only for a moment until he has realized what he has done. Now he must decided to come clean, or just pretend it did not happen. The bulk of the movie is the affair and all the places and ways she cheats. But a good movie, Diane Lane, and Olivier Martenez make it very watchable
0	lack of the depth and profoundness of those original 26 movies what made the original 26 zatoishi movies as one of the best creations in japanese movie history was its profoundness, the depth of a blind wandering swordsman, often lonely but inevitably beloved by some beautiful young women, usually giving you a helpless, melancholy, nostalgic romantic broken dream. the original zatoishi movies were also having the integrity of solid screenplays, fantastic directing, wonderful settings, perfect supporting performance, amazing fighting scenes and sequences, seamlessly perfected editings....from the first two black and white ones to the other 24 colored ones, none of them was never seriously produced. and best of all, shintaro played the zatoishi role almost seamlessly perfect that oscar or any other kind of film festivals would suffice enough to honor him. i just don't know and don't see why and how this new addition would be necessary in any way. why suddenly the great zatoishi blind swordman became an overly ruthless, heartless, and cunning mobster, a stereotyped trademark of an vicious yakuza killer instead of guardian angel of the helpless common people? so bloody and so pointlessly gory gross? it's a quite hollow and shallow one if compares to those originals. yes, the movie industry's technique maybe more modern, but if we failed to deliver a better and newer version and interpretation of this great legend and character in japanese samurai genre, we better not, shall we say: you don't need add crawling feet to a snake when trying to make a snake look more alive. it's totally unnecessary
1	The alternative would've been to make more of the same. A lot of fans of series 1 through 6 would say series 7 & 8 are a travesty, or that they are a letdown. I suppose that would make me one of the solitary voices of opposition. The way I see it, 7 & 8 are simply the natural progression of the show. Even around series 6, I've noticed that the same tired old jokes were being run into the ground, particularly in regards to Cat's nose/sniff gags, one-liners about dead fashions, and Kryten's sudden and unexplainable lapses back into his inability to call Rimmer a "smeghead" (Smeeee-heeee!). I don't know how the diehard fans abide it, but for me, it got a little old. Starting with series 7, there's a bit more drama involved, and not such a disregard for the lack of continuity. The cliffhanger at the end of series 8 leaves you wanting, but as it's now approaching 10 years since, I wouldn't hold out hopes for another series. Don't be surprised if that's all, folks
1	My two year old enjoys it quite a bit... This is my two year olds first Bob the Builder. He has generally only wanted to watch a Baby Mozart and nothing else, but the first time he watched it, he was hooked. He would sit there and nothing could distract him. He really enjoys the opening song of Bob the Builder, but he does get a little bored toward the end of the show. With that said, the first 20 minutes are gold for him as he really enjoys it. This is not too bad for us adults either except for Lofty who is always whiny and tough to listen to, but it is a nice little show. He would give the show 2 thumbs up! We will be trying some additional Bob the Builder dvds
0	Great movie ... ... ruined by bad dubbing. Unfortunately there is there is nothing in the Amazon listing or even on the DVD case indicating that this is dubbed. A nasty trick to play on buyers who prefer the original language
0	90% of VIDEO DOES NOT MATCH MUSIC. The very Best of the DJ Tiesto REAL LIVE Show is the amazing synchronization between the music and the show (lights, fireworks, etc.) This DVD is TOTALLY unsync; and doesn't make justice to the real thing. The real thing is just amazing. The DVD version is just BAD; VERY BAD. More than disappointed I hate the moment when I made my decision to bought this DVD. REALY BAD !!

0	one more chopped film is now in the pipe We have a new victim in the vecinity. Unwelcome! Title: see above. A small, juicy, masterpiece by Jack Ford has been cut from the original 1,33:1 format to 1,85:1. We are left only with the small consolation to deplore it. More: we have been deprieved of the real product for HOW LONG?. Shame
1	WHY WHY? So I finished watching season 5 and let me tell you there are no words to describe how good the dialogue, the action, and the story arc was. Please give this show a chance you will not regret it. Yes, season 1 was slow but that's how it is usually. Afterwards, the show continues to grow. Season 5 is probably my favorite because of Spike and the storyline. I was pretty sad about FRED. Wesley is such an amazing character who becomes his own person on Angel. I love what they did to him. This was worth all my money. Please someone tell me a show out there rite now that beats Angel and Buffy. I mean the writing was sooo good this season how could WB even think to cancel this show? Now we will never see Angel again...BOOO WB!
1	these muthas crazy! the dvd is one of the best in my collection. it shows you how thes cats are really like off camera. these are some real brothas. bizzy is the craziest little dude. there could have been more live performances. they should have put the "crossroads" performed live at the mtv music awards on here instead of the one they put on. other than that this dvd is of tha chain. get this. all bone fans need to have this
0	Not all that good. Not a huge fan of James Cagney or gangster movies, and nothing about White Heat has changed that opinion. Lame plot, corny dialogue, and just plain bad acting constantly had me cringing. In it's day this movie was no different than the generic blow-em'-up action/adventure movies that Hollywood has churned out en masse in more recent decades. Hardly what I would consider to be a classic
0	Lover's Lane......another horrible wannabe slasher movie to add to the pile Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the "Hook Man" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns arent even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous
0	Reincarnation I'd seen Shimizu's "The grudge" and so my expectations were pretty high on this supernatural horror film. It's nowhere near the scariness or originality of the grudge but that bein said, it's not too horrible as far as japanese horror flicks goes these days. The trailer was actually a lot scarier than the actual movie. The special FX are probably better than other stuff I've seen recently in b-type movies. Bottom line, I was expecting much more out of this
1	for all j-horror fans ^_^ this is probably i think the THIRD in the j-horror series being realeased by LGF by the creater of INFECTION & PREMONITION. good continuation of the series so far. think of it like THE TWILIGHT ZONE type of movie series. plus for trailers of this fine movie you can visit.

0	Horrible quality. IF you are looking for a set of W.C. Fields shorts or films, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SET. I made the mistake of buying this set and I am thoroughly unhappy with the shoddy quality of this set. I filed a complaint with the manufacturers of this set, Passport Video, and they have refused to refund me. So do not buy any of their merchandise as their "no refund" policy seems to be an across the board business practice with them. Save your money and buy a quality film like "The Bank Dick," or "It's a Gift.
0	[2.5]--Cheese-la-Weez What Happen Here? As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot. This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable. Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking.
1	Action This movie was packed full of action and very well configured fighting. Jet Li did a wonderful acting and fighting job as always
0	2 Stars For Poor Quality DVD. Great Movie. I have read in another review that the "John Wayne Collection" edition of this DVD is of poor picture quality. I have the "Collector's Eddition", and the picture quality is terrible on this one as well. This is a great movie, a classic. It was filmed beautifully in Ireland and deserves better then this. I hope the studio will one day give this outstanding movie the treatment it deserves
1	ANOTHER MOB HIT... This is simply a great mob movie. Based upon the best selling book, "Wiseguy", by Nicholas Pileggi, it traces the rise and fall of "gansta" wannabe turned government informant, Henry Hill. Skillfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this film with its all star cast, megawatt performances, and period music soundtrack packs quite a wallop to the senses. Named 1990's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, and National Society of Film Critics, it garnered six Academy Award nominations and earned Joe Pesci an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In the 1950s, a preteen Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) began his career as a "gansta" wannabe on the mean streets of East New York, where a small Italian American community thrived. Working with Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino's) crew, he worked his way up, doing the penny ante, gofer stuff, until he began more heavy duty involvement. As a young man, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) took to his life in the underworld like a fish takes to water. He married a nice, jewish girl whom he turned into a shrewish girl, as he lived the life he wanted. His wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), also became entranced by the perks available to a mobster Henry teamed up with Jimmy "The Gent" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Together they stole, lied, cheated, and killed their way through life, until they got wacked or got caught. When Henry, against the express advice of Paul Cicero, got involved with Jimmy in the 1970s cocaine drug trade, it was the beginning of the end for him and Jimmy. The film skillfully chronicles the rise and fall of Henry Hill from wiseguy to goverment informant in the witness protection program.. It is amazing that the actor playing young Henry Hill, Christopher Serrone, resembles Ray Liotta so much, right down to the piercing hazel eyes. He gives a terrific performance as young Henry, expressing all the joie de vivre that young Henry had over being associated with mobsters. Ray Liotta, as the adult Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance. The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives. He clearly enjoys all the perks of a mobster, his only regret being that he could never be a "made" guy, because he was not fully Italian, as his mother was Sicilian but his father was Irish. Robert DeNiro is wonderful as Jimmy Conway, low key yet powerful. Joe Pesci gives an over the top performance as the wild, volatile, and totally crazy Tommy DeVito, an out of control wiseguy who has no redeeming value as a human being. He is a guy who does not think twice about killing someone over something trivial. Paul Sorvino is excellent as the mob boss who is all about the family and plays it the old fashioned way. Lorraine Bracco gives the performance of her life as Karen Hill, a woman besotted by the life of a mobster's wife, until she realizes that girlfriends are an expected part of that life. She is sensational. This is simply a great mob movie. It is a film that the viewer will watch again and again. I, myself , have seen it at least three or four times, and each time is as if it were the first. Vastly entertaining, this film is a worthy addition to one's collection
0	Not Even Worth It At These Prices I wasted my money to watch CdeB 1.) try but fail to carry a full concert with only himself 2.) see the camera repeatedly zero in on a touched fan in the audience...who happens to be part of CdeB's marketing organization 3.) try to convince everyone that he irons his own shirts and is not a rich snob. Chris DeBurgh, I'm a fan of your music and lyrics, please stop cheating your fans out of their money for sub-standard products as this one... Now I know why it was so affordable...but you dont even get what you pay for on this one..
1	FABULOUS! This is a terrific period piece. Characters are well developed, cinematography is great, and story is fine. Well worth the price
0	WHAT!!!!!! I kept watching this hoping a plot would eventually come up. But it didnt .
1	Nothing new, but isn't that the point Every now and then we sould honor the memory of Morse and John Thaw. Inspector Lewis does that plus it brings some closure to the other key character. So the author of this screen play is no Colin Dexter and reverted to remaking Hamlet - at least it is admitted in the dialog itself. Very predictable plot twists and well crafted ending. All in all, 5 stars if you're into Morse. Skip it if you aren't
1	Well I Really Liked It! The movie is similar to Crash. It is a comedy/drama about the subject of immigration, emigration and racial mixing among modern day Czechs. The performances are expertly acted and very moving. I love the storyline of a skinhead footballer who tries to "adopt" a colored boy when his wife buys him and brings him home. It seems when it comes to having a son, color doesn't really matter all that much, even to a committed Ayran!
0	Two hours of misery among losers For me, my low rating of this film might be, at least in part, the result of having wrong expectations about it. I had heard this film described as 'charming' and 'funny,' and was expected a comedy, albeit a somewhat black one. But despite the good acting, this film left a sour taste in my mouth. It is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about. I am an avid foreign language film buff, but I could not see the merit in this crude, hate-ridden and depressing story.
1	Classic Sixties Movie Magic! Two for The Road is a true sixties comedydrama in every sense of the word. It is also one of the best roadmovies up to date. It is a funny, dramatic and an absolute pleasure to watch that will stay in your mind for some time. Starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn and the funny Albert Finney, the story follows a married couple who's flame of relationship has burnt out. The marriage is on the rocks while flashbacks show how their relationship began while both were travelling through Europe. The director, Stanley Donen (who also directed Hepburn in Funny Face (1956) and in Charade (1963)) has made a film that is a true masterpiece. The way the movie is cut and edited is absolutely fasenating and makes the film very great to watch. You will be swinging around from one situation to the next in absolute joy. The characters are great, the situations fun and the romance is delicious. Next to those comedic moments there is also a chunk of drama in the film. It fits perfectly and doesn't feel like it is unnecessary next to the comedy, which is another element that makes the film wortwhile to take a look at. The film is ballanced just fine and isn't hanging too much in one direction. Considering artdirection the movie is true eyecandy. Beautiful, colorful locations are seen throughout the film with an even more beautiful Audrey Hepburn. This film made her the true fashion icon of the sixties. She is prefectly dressed in every single scene and made women all over the world want to be like her even more. Her acting is once again grand, you just can't go wrong with Hepburn. You'll be charmed and enchanted by her looks, personality and that big shiney smile. Albert Finney plays Hepburn's husband, a fun role. He acts great and makes you love him or hate him in the various situations. He is believable even though he is pushing his performance to the beginning of being unbelievable, which brings great fun to watch and a memorable performance. The music of the famous Henri Manchini (Breakfast at Tiffany's, Charade, The Pink Panter) is beautiful and fits the film perfectly. Emotions are made stronger, situations are made funnier and even more romantic then they already are by this fasenating soundtrack. The main theme will be playing in your mind for some time after seeying this film. So the film is a true enjoyment for both eye and ear. It entertains you, wether by the story, locations, music, that lovely Audrey Hepburn or that funny Albert Finney. It wants you to travel with them and long to the sixties. Two for the Road is a masterpiece that will leave you with that smile on your face that you want to have when looking for entertainment.
1	Warriors of the Vatican This is based on the book VAMPIRE$ by John Steakley. James Woods is a cynical vampire hunter and leads a team sanctioned by the Vatican. But after a job in the Southwest things go wrong. Suddenly a vampire shows up who is immensely powerful and knows Woods by name. In just moments the vampire slaughters everyone present, slayers, cops, prostitutes. Only those who were not there survived. To make matters worse, the Monsignor in charge of the slayers has arrived from the Vatican and wishes to meet with Woods. Woods is introduced to a new priest for the team and told to assemble and train a new team. But Woods is ticked off and wants to know how a vampire can be so powerful and also knows his name. Woods does not follow his orders. Instead he tries to track down the vampire. It seems this is the original vampire; the one who spawned the rest. The vampire was created during a botched exorcism and seeks to perform a new ritual that will make him even more powerful and eliminate some of his weaknesses. Woods has little time to find the vampire and put a stop to him. Woods also has to put up with team members who are in grave danger of turning into vampires themselves. Armed with guts, a hatred of vampires, and some modern weaponry Woods is all that stands between the world and total domination by vampire. This is a James Woods movie pure and simple. Sure, it has vampires, action, and women, but it is Woods that makes the movie. His character is wonderful. You have to wonder at how desperate the Vatican is for slayers to even tolerate Woods let alone employ him. The slaying techniques are different, efficient, and very sensible. All in all a pretty fun movie with James Woods at his absolute best. Fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly will probably get a kick out of the score which seems to have inspired the music in Firefly.

0	Great cartoons, bad DVD I'm impressed that Disney is comming to their senses and putting out this old vintage stuff on DVD, I remember this series from when I was a young kid, I originally said in the review for "Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers" that these DVD's are not worth it because I only liked the theme song but now I changed my mind. The animation is superb, the story is wonderful, and some of the characters(Cubbi and Sunni) are cute! I'm not happy because all they had on the DVD were episiodes of the TV series only no bonus features whatsoever, not even interviews with the original voice actors, I know bill Scott is dead but June Foary is still around along with corey burton. Disney this is still your property please treat it with respect!
1	HARRYHAUSEN TAKES THE TORCH FROM O'BRIEN WITH THESE CLASSICS! If I think of a Cyclops, there is only one that comes to mind(I know there were two in this movie). It is the Cyclops in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. If I think of a fire breathing Dragon, it is from this great movie I see the definative Dragon! Ray Harryhausen has created so many incredible creatures it is amazing that there are some people out there that just don't know what they are missing. The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is another classic included in this set. The least of the three movies included in this set is Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, it is a good installment showing what a master craftsmen Harryhausen had become! The DVD set has great transfers and some nice extras. This is essential Harryhausen.
0	Dreary, hard to watch. Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale. Began to watch it last night. I was able to sit thru the part 1. When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1! The movie is DREARY to the max. People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers. In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago... To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956). For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects. People have been already destroyed in their souls. They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience. Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie. To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia. In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn, and autistic.
1	The Long Journey of an Artist Andrei Rublyov (1969) by Andrei Tarkovsky is my number 1 (shares with Tarkovsky's Zerkalo) film of all time. It is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever. The beauty of every frame is exquisite - I have to pause film very often just to admire it.There are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as Andrei Rublyov did. I am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for Tarkovsky, it is very well paced, and I am never tired of its 3+ hours running time. Film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter Andrei Rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism, and later by Tatar invaders. Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film: what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God, the Artist and the Power. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me, the last chapter of the film, "The Bell" is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it. Boriska sobbing like a child after his Bell rings - and he is a child, a boy, lonely and lost; Andrei breaking his vows of silence, his words to Boriska of hope, of many roads they would walk together. Andrei's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire, their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity, their melodic lines and pure joyful colors, the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery, quiet knowledge and sadness, looking inside themselves and inside our very souls; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this Earth, to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the "swiftest birds" of pain and death can't reach you...
0	Another Nicolas Roeg Train Wreck! There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good? Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really! It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent. The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh... The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it
0	Low budget porn. The only reason why I watch this video is because Hunk model Tony Ward stars in it. Tony Ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in Madonna's controversial Justify My Love video. Since then I have not been able to get studly Tony Ward out of my mind. He is the only reason for watching this film. Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood. I warn you that this film is not very good. Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film. The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward. If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him. Otherwise, discard the rest of the film. This film is really not suitable for people of any age
1	Highly recommended. For those who enjoyed "Road Home" here comes another wonderful version of an emotional film involving teachers. In this case the story is developing around the first love of an innocent village girl and the newly arrived teacher. In this mixture of sad and happy moments we can enjoy the innocence and purity of a young girl who discovers love for the first time, the effort of a teacher to remain impartial and fair as a teacher towards a girl that he started liking too. The involvement in the story of other teachers and people around their daily life, adds interest and emotion. Soon the viewer is part of the story. The photography is magnificent and the music typical of the 60s. This wonderful selection of music is also a centerpiece in the development of the story. A very well balanced film, running smoothly and keeping the viewer interested, full of emotion, throughout the entire duration. Highly recommended.
0	B Is For aBominaBle Or how about B is for, "An R Rated scooBy Doo"? Yes, it's really that silly. Funny thing about Abominable is that I was actually entertained. But was it a good movie? The idea of providing potential viewers/purchasers of this movie with a customer review is to help them decide whether or not the movie is worthy of purchase, right? Or let's just say that a review here is to determine whether or not you should even rent/view. I gave Abominable 2 stars. Then why...after I just said I was entertained by Abominable...would I only give it 2 stars? Well, it's this dilemma I've been having with trying to fairly rate movies in order "to be helpful". What I mean is, in the genre: Aliens would be 5 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 5 star movie comparatively? No way. The Descent would be 4 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 4 star movie comparatively? No way. Slither would be 3 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 3 star movie comparatively? No way. I am left with an entertaining movie that doesn't compare to the aforementioned. Hence, I can (fairly) only give Abominable 2 stars, right? Look, according to Amazon a 2 star rating means, "I didn't like it". But that's not really true. It was okay. It started good and went quickly into the spiraling vortex of a silly, continuity-issue, B-acted, made-for-TV Horror flick. So go for it if you're compelled to watch a movie about Big Foot gone wild with the classic deaths of those that break the "Scream" rules of what you're not supposed to do in a Horror movie (complete with gratuitous nudity) in order to stay alive. Abominable is not quite as bad as the 2-star "I didn't like it" rating that I donned it with. But it sure ain't no 3-star Slither. It's a 2006 made for TV B-movie. B is for snow joB.
0	Schlock, not Shock This is an unbelievably bad film. Its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer Gary Ridgeway's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film's tawdry, fictionalized action scenes. I hadn't known this footage of Gary Ridgeway existed. A documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie. The movie doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity. For example, the extremely amateurish actor who plays Ridgeway doesn't match the real Ridgeway's physical description at all. The real Ridgeway was not a "tall, handsome, muscular" fellow. He was shorter, and unassuming-looking. Also, the majority of Ridgeway's victims were not the glamorous, seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here. They were lonely, struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the Seatac Highway. If you want a better insight into the character of Ridgeway's victims and crimes, read Ann Rule's book, "Green River, Running Red." In any case, avoid this movie mess.
0	The book is better. This film is based on one of my favourite books, so I was really looking forward to seeing it. Despite great performances by Blanchett and Fienes, it just doesn't hold together well. Too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight. The characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing. The book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not. There is also an ending tacked on that doesn't exist in the book, and that always annoys me. I was very disappointed. I think had I not read the book, I'd have stopped watching the movie about 1/3 into it
1	IT'S IN LETTERBOX, and it's good It's old, and so many of the people have died, but it's a great documentary. It's also in letterbox, unlike what Amazon is stating it being in a pan-and-scan state. mik
1	Well above average southern horror drama is worthy of any TV series collection `American Gothic', a TV series, is a supernatural drama consisting of 22 episodes, some of which where not aired during the original run. It ran on CBS for one year between 1995 and 1996. Its creator Sam Raimi had already worked on southern horror projects such as `Evil Dead I & II' and would later go on to direct the southern horror thriller `The Gift' before breaking box office records with his `Spider-man' series success. Southern horror is nothing new as Stephen King attests using some of his best works as an example, such as `The Stand'. We also have the `Children of the Corn' series (nobody said all southern horror was great), the works of David Lynch and `Frailty' to name a few of what is a whole DVD section unto itself. Apart from the modern `Carnivale' TV series it is hard to find southern horror outside of some `X Files' or `Twilight Zone' episodes. The most obvious parallel though is to Lynch and `Twin Peaks', and for those who enjoyed Peaks, then Gothic offers a slightly less satisfying but equally as interesting plot type. Gothic is about the town of Trinity, Deep South southern Carolina, that is home to what seems to be the devil himself in the guise of Sheriff Lucas Buck, who in the view of his deputies has never done an honest days police work in his life. Buck is creating illegitimate sons in order to sire his successor. Caleb Temple, an orphan, finds himself caught between his murdered sister's ghost pleas for revenge while a plot is hatched by Buck to turn Caleb to the dark side. Caleb's cousin, Gail Emory and local doctor Matt Crower, are determined to ensure that Caleb doesn't fall into the clutches of Buck's psychopathic fatherly lessons. The scene is set for explosive tension between this world and the next. American Gothic was aired out of the directors intended sequence by the instances of CBS who also refused to air some episodes. The episodes "Echo of Your Last Goodbye" and "Strangler" where not aired. "Potato Boy" and "Ring of Fire" were aired out of sequence. This same inconsistent sequence is presented in the DVD box set. For this reason you need to know the intended viewing order before you watch the DVD. The intended viewing is - "Pilot", "A Tree Grows in Trinity", "Eye of the Beholder", "Damned if You Don't", "Potato Boy", "Dead to the World", "Meet the Beetles", "Strong Arm of the Law", "To Hell and Back", "The Beast Within", "Rebirth", "Ring of Fire", "Resurrector", "Inhumanitas", "The Plague Sower", "Doctor Death Takes a Holiday", "Learning to Crawl", "Echo of Your Last Goodbye", "Strangler", "Triangle", "The Buck Stops Here" and "Requiem". Compared to Peaks, Gothic is far more supernatural and slowly burned its way to a specific cult following that didn't generate any ground breaking ratings. A second season of Gothic did not appear, however when other stations aired Gothic in its intended order the ratings improved. The DVD series is also very popular. There are many reasons to believe that Gothic could have been made for extra seasons (what produ$er would not?) as there are some loose ends, but that is not to say that American Gothic does not stand alone as this mini-series, it does and it can. The only real onion is that one of the leads Dr. Crow (Jake Weber) left the show, or was written out, only a few episodes from the end. Apart from these minor production drawbacks American Gothic builds slowly but gains a lot of momentum towards the concluding episodes for a mind-blowing supernatural Abrahamic type finale on a staircase. If you like a good supernatural TV series and if you like originality with some of the best wit ever scripted and some serious dead pan sarcasm every split second, then look no further. And for those who boil at `CBS butchery' they can now own all of the Gothic episodes and watch it in the order it was meant to be viewed
1	awesome This DVD collection is a must if you are a fan of D&D. It is the perfect additon to add to your 80s video collection to remember your childhood days that are long past
1	Fans Rejoice! Good buy for new and "true blue" fans alike! FREEDOM FIGHTERS FOREVER! The short review: Way Past Cool! If you're a fan of the series you have to have this DVD collection! The long review: EPISODES For anyone who's had to stand watching cut or badly recorded episodes from TV, I can't express how good it feels to watch these in clear stereo with no tracking lines and perfect picture. I can even see the paintbrush strokes in the background art it's so clear! So far as I can tell, everything has been restitched back together wonderfully and I can see no weird edits. It's just like I remember in Ben Hurst's words "fresh - like watching it for the first time!" BONUS FEATURES A few people have complained about the lack of bonus features, but I can't say good enough about them. The series was produced 10 years ago, since then most if not all of the artwork in the vaults has been lost, sold online (I've seen a number of cels pass by there) or locked away. The fact they managed to find even a small amount of high-quality artwork makes it well worth the trouble. I too wish there was more, but the stuff they did find is very good. I believe there are really only two bits of the extended/deleted scenes that are truly new material but it's all well archived and the one silent animatic has the script super-scripted in so it's easy to follow. The concept art is beautiful, there are a few new model/expression sheets in the interview with Hurst and tons of background art that will blow you away. This is the same quality one would expect in feature post production work. Both of the interviews are engaging, enlightening and even a little tearful at times, especially Ben's moving speech about Season 3 and his support for the fans. Considering how hard the crew at FUS has worked to get this DVD, they deserve it. The DVD menus themselves are a blast -- I have seen a number of poorly produced menus with "craptastic" art in them and these blow me away. They are thoughtful and even funny! In one part Snively hits the "Bonus Features" button. It's the little things like that which show the effort and care they put into making the DVD. BOX ART Okay so some of the artists who contributed art are very young and aren't what you would call "good artists". But to me, it's refreshing to see a company that actually WANTED and ACCEPTED input from the fan base. It shows that we are all united together as fans of Sonic, no matter what our background is. You can tell each of the artists was excited and trying their best to make something to show how much they love the show. I go as far to say a few of these artists ARE exceptional, some of them even drawing "on-model" as we in the animation business say. Ken Penders (while not really a fan per se since he's worked professionally on Sonic Artwork) did a pretty good job with the cover, as it did include most of the cast and it doesn't show anything that isn't there (Thank Goodness his arms aren't blue either :D). Compared to the first test cover, this final one is much better. Dr. Robotnik is the best part of the cover, he's very well drawn. ANYTHING ELSE? Just so you know where I'm coming from, I was prime age when SATAM came out, being 10 at the time, and it is a big reason I am who I am today and certainly a reason why I'm going into the animation industry. That being said I can't express enough why it's important to support this release. They did a fantastic job. And I think it's worth buying this for any Sonic fan, especially if you know someone who likes Sonic X -- In Sonic's words, "Get ready to rock, cause this will knock your socks off!" :) If you're new to Sonic and like this series, I highly recommend checking out Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sonic Underground as well (the other two shows produced by DiC, the predecessor to SATAM and it's later cousin, respectively.) A lot of fans would say otherwise but I just can't get enough of the blue blur! - Joanie /^
1	inspirational as a theology student, as a citizen, and as a human being the movie touched me at every level. the transformation story of archbishop romero is not only about an individual hero but touches upon what it means for a church to have a human face. what role a church must play when caught between politics and violence. it is relevant to us today as we face a new global hegemony. the people around the world are being exploited in the name of capitalism and democracy. while, we, the fat americans stand by and watch in indifference the people suffering? some 2 billion people who makes less than a $1/day. will we rise up? will we open our eyes and to see the plight of the majority of humanity outside the boundaries of united states? who will speak for them? who will hear their cries? may i be as courageous as archbishop romero in speaking the truth and to confront the systems of power and indifference.
1	"Out of my way, Dildo...!" Despite the fact that it was slapped with an X rating, Flesh Gordon is really a Spoof of the old movie serials of the 30s and 40s... most notably Flash Gordon. In fact if you saw the old Flash Gordon serials you'll really find the film funny... The humor is basically Kentucky Fried Movie and Groove Tube type camp... funny almost "Rocky Horror-esque" lines, and over the top scenarios. - - The film is most interesting because the low budget special effects are pretty good (the FX team seems to take up half the credits and one of them went on to DIRECT the THE HELLS HAVE EYES), yet at the same time it is definitely a NUDIE of that era... (the flip side is that it has enough plot, content and dialogue that you could edit it all out and it would still be funny.) In the end, I'm really surprized that this campy CULT CLASSIC isn't one of the all time movie nerd favorites... it is genuinely funny and tasteless from the get go to the big finale ! *as a funny side note aside from a really cool and groovy tune featuring some Jazzy fender Rhodes, there's an... organ scene featuring some really nifty and gospelly Hammond Organ... the guy is *really* playing the pedals and playing the chords like you rarely get to hear these days
0	Disappointing... This is baed on one of 4 Novels that Sir Conan Doyle wrote in his Sherlock Holmes series. Since the book has a lot of details and a lot of exposition that can really go wrong in a feature film length movie, I had expected that a reasonable change & corresponding adaptation were made to translate this into a movie. Alas! The constant mediocre suspense throughout the movie added on by Sherlock Holmes' very rude attitude toward Miss. Morstan were appalling. The book says that Sherlock Holmes said "state your case" in a brisk manner. "Brisk" is nothing close to being rude in its meaning of the word. Dr. Watson in numerous accounts describes Sherlock Holmes as having a gentleness towards women. He may not express any fondness for women but was chivalrous nonetheless. Granted the character of Sherlock Holmes is not an easy one to portray for any actors, and so far Jeremy Brett captures it the best. However, this one was surely disappointing. Holmes' keen nature and energy was well demonstrated but his good professional mannerism was surely lacking & compromised. I blame the script more than the actors really. This adapation just doesn't capture the tone & flow of the original book. I highly recommend short story adaptations like Adventures of Sherlock Holmes & the Return of Sherlock Holmes series in Granada Series intead of any feature length installment. Short story adaptations were much better than feature length ones
0	Great to Learn about Yuppies I should have known this movie would be terrible because it stars Matthew McConaughey. McConaughey plays one thing well - the smarmy yuppie. Having grown up in a working class Manhattan family, I know the type well. He does an excellent job at this one role for which he is type cast again and again. This film is no exception. The worst thing about this movie is that even though I only watched about 2/3, I had to use grease-cutting cleaner to clean my tv screen free of all the slime.
0	Preview it before you show it. I bought this for my SciFi class. We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film. It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach. Everyone was so disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up. The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff. Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long. Bela Lugosi is a much better bet. For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans
1	An excellent fourth series This series is in my opinion, better than the previous three seasons as the pace is quicker and there are more jokes per minute. The writers were at a creative peak by this point and the show hit its highest ratings in America. The episode - til death do we volley - is an excellent example of how great this season was, it is hilarious from start to finish and full of funny twists. The times when Rose begins to tell a St Olaf story are often met by much more bitchiness that before and you can see how each character's personality has been developed since the show started. I ordered this DVD for use in the UK as unfortunately no more series are being released in Europe due to poor sales of the previous three. I found that it played fine in my multi-region DVD player, and came with better packaging too
0	a propaganda film gone wrong. This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. Barbet Schroeder's film, a "self-portrait" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda. The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin. The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes. This film has significance, but is not a good one
0	Price of DVD Are you sure this is not a misprint? Who in their right mind would pay $114.00 for a DVD?
0	Okay for a low budget gun flick This movie is okay if you like low budget gangsta movies without any plot. People compare this movie to City of God and I have to wonder what they've been smoking. This movie is just like any of the other straight to Dvd movies starring a rappper except its about Jamacans in Miam
1	One of the funniest DVD's ever I have to admit being a New Yorker I have never have had to live with knowing my team would never win the big one and instead would always lose in the most crushing ways possible. But this DVD had me cracking up the whole way through. Its amazing to watch these fans live for a team that cannot ever get over the hump. But towards the end I started feeling really bad for all these people. Cause you could see the anguish in their eyes, and in their faces. This team really means a lot to them. The fact that it is the brass ring (in this case winning a World Series) none of them will ever be able to grab left me feeling bad for them. Having said that I still laughed about as hard as I ever have at a DVD. My Dad, and I have watched it several times and we still laugh like crazy
1	My cat, Tippy, loves this!! I have had different cat videos and DVD's over the years and usually my cat, Tippy, gets bored after a day or two. I have had this DVD for two months and Tippy still watches it regularly. Also, there is a loop feature. the other day I left the DVD on the loop feature and it kept Tippy entertained while I left for work. I highly recommend this DVD if you love your cat
0	Captives I have seen Julia Ormond in some good movies and she is a great actress. This is not one of them. Senseless subject. The audio is bad, or the language is not what I am used with, so I understood only half of what they said in the movie. Stay away from this one
1	This Is Great. I am so glad that I ordered this DVD. I recently bought a Knifty Knitter set from Herschners online store and a couple of books here on Amazon on how to use them. While the books aren't that confusing, this video cleared up a lot of questions. It was great to see the priojects done in first person view. They are very easy to follow. :) The DVD gave me a better understanding of what was being done on the loom. I can now follow the books prett easily. Thanks
0	Waited this long for Widescreen and No FULL Extended Version Unbelievable. I mean come on, we're only talkin about a few minutes here. Missing some of the funniest scenes in the 1st movie including the German Jacque Cousteau character scene. I didnt even know the laserdisc version was an 'extended' version until now. Thank god I still have the laserdisc. Another incident of movie companies raping the public. Grrrrrh..
0	So disappointed I didn't think I'd miss the Christopher Reeve superman movies (one and two at least) and I really miss George Reeves now!!!! Those black and white Superman shows were the best! what's her name was a HORRIBLE Lois Lane!!!! The whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row! I don't even care about the deleted scenes! I want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - I'm going to give this one away! Brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull!! I remember now that my brother told me I could wait for cable. I got greedy - someone bought him a DVD that was coded for another country (there was russian writing on it) and it wouldn't work in my DVD player so I got Amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in Brooklyn. I SHOULDA WAITED FOR CABLE
0	Good Pictures, Very bad Story. For me, as an old Superman reader, i found the movie story very hard to "believe". The picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece, wish Richard Donner has this same techonolgy in 1978. Why the story is so weak? First, it is not logical for Superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially Lois (And specially if their relation went to making love this time). Second, the reason of this disappearing, and what a reason, he knew from sciencetes that his planet, Krypton, MIGHT no be explode and there are some survivors, well, Superman doesn't need Earth People to tell him about his Planet, he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check, under the red sun radiations. And if we presume that he went for this reason, why it took him 4 years to come back? ,....... no answer. Third, Clark Kent was absance too, for the same period like Superman, is it normal for Lois not to doubt in this matter, we all know she is the all time person who always think that Clark Kent is Superman, but now she even doesn't care of saying hello to him? ??? Fourth, why he need Space Ship to come back to earth? We all know that under the Yellow Sun, he gain all his power back. More and more, i can't believe when he can carrie a whole island of Kryptonite all this distance from earth to space, while he usually can't breath if he was under the radiation of the Green Kryptonite. Well, this story suits children who are new to Superman. I think they should contact people like Alan Moore and Cary Bates next time if they want to make Superman Movie.
1	Cold War Fun I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and when my Dad recommended getting this I was glad you did because it is so funny. The humour is still fresh despite the cold war being over. A movie like this could never work today but its still good clean fun
1	There's a good chance you'll hate this movie. If you're anything like 80% of the folks in the theater when I saw this film, you'll probably start rolling your eyes, exhaling loudly, and moaning about 1/3 in. With that said, I thought it was fantastic. The Fountain is flawed, for sure, in its pacing and its grandiosity, but what you get in return for patience is a very thoughtful and gorgeous experience. It's clear that Aronofsky really loved this project. Other reviewers hsve said that this isn't so much a movie, but a work of art, and while I'm a bit hesitant, I agree. Don't expect Requiem for a Dream. Don't expect a "thrill ride". Just watch it when you have the time/headspace to devote to it, and you'll feel something, one way or the other. *The soundtrack, by the way, is nearly as beautiful as the film itself. Definitely to be checked out
0	Movie for the Un-intelligent...? This movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor. Are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny? Sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society. I'm not a stiff when it comes to humor, but I trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with Fox. Fox Network is a base for right-wing Republican stupidity. This movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities. I think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of American humor have gone. Hurray for the 1st amendments and others our Four Fathers came up with, I think they were brillant men. I am all for Free-Speech but I believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public. This film definitely over stepped its boundaries. For all those people who loved this movie...why are there sooooo many (around 180) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago!?!?! I thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto...Just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents
1	A pilates routine to grow and lean with.. I've taken live pilates lessons in class and one-on-one setting. Due to cost/transportation restraints, I wanted to keep up the progress I was seeing in my abs/core (that no length or amount of sustained crunches ever gave me). I tried many and learned from many instructors via dvd, but once I got to Hilary's dvd-I realized I found the 'one' who could both instruct and inspire most like a live instruction setting. Her method is not commercialized, but personalized in its relaxed setting yet still true to the philosophy of Joseph Pilates without being too highbrow for a groggy early morning or weary late evening. In 30 minutes, you will cover a number of the standard Pilates movements without losing focus on quality of movement over quantity. She's very easy to spend time with. At the end of the workout, I'm lightly sweating, stretched out, abs worked and feeling very feminine and strong.. get it. I hope you make the same and more progress than I have
0	Sam has done much better Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed
1	Propaganda, but very well done. Dziga Vertov's film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema (I say this with some reservations -- see below). The viewer is quite literally transported to the Soviet Union of the past. We witness love and loss, happiness and sadness, life and death. We witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day, a wedding and a divorce, a birth and a funeral. All the scenes are real -- the birth is a real birth, the funeral a real funeral, the divorce a real divorce. Nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people. The music is quite inventive and amazing, especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it. The editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of Soviet silent cinema. That said, there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth -- that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity, that those who follow the Party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible. So many people are shocked by Nazi propaganda films such as "Triumph of the Will," -- I find it sad that more people are not troubled by Soviet era films which tout the beauty of Marxist-Leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide (i.e. the Ukranians)carried out by the Soviets for over seventy years. The fact of the matter is that Soviet Marxist-Leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others. This is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking
0	good idea, bad movie I thought the idea of Phone Booth was great, but the movie is just bad. Maybe Hitchcock or Welles could have pulled it off, but this is just plain sad. Skip it
1	Grande Damage Imagine you are walking through a great art museum, overwhelmed by one massive canvas after another. In your rapture you almost walk right past a tiny painting in the corner, an unassuming, faultless Vermeer. That is this movie. Watch it on its own terms, in its own time, and you will certainly love it. Ladies In Lavender is a star vehicle for two British Grande Dames, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith - that's hard to beat for star power. (Indeed, the only thing missing in this movie is Helen Mirren.) Almost everything except the plot fuels the story, the plot is so small it would be easily lost in the garden these sisters keep. Place is massively important, and brilliantly recreated. Pace is massively important; these people lead simple, slow lives. Most of all, emotional nuance drives the bus here, Maggie Smith can say more with a furrowed brow than any ten Hollywood actors with a well-polished script. The film invites adult viewers to take an adult look at the many different forms love takes, and their consequences. From the bitter and cynical aging doctor, to the painfully vulnerable and naive Ursula, Dench, to the cool yet kind Janet, Smith, this film weaves leitmotifs with such a deft hand you barely notice. The young man, Andrea, is played adequately by Daniel Bruhl, while Olga, young, manipulative, and ambitious, is the girl everyone loves to hate because she seems to have it all. Olga is played by Natascha McElhone. Ms. McElhone is fortunate to have been blessed with model-esque good looks; if you look carefully you can see her being out-acted by a footstool, a washstand, and a pair of knitting needles. Those who enjoy metaphor and symbolism will not have to meditate overly long before realizing that the love these aging sisters bestow on their innocent foundling is a give and take proposition. Ultimately they commit the greatest act of selflessness any person can, they must free their "child" and let him live. (Irony here since they are what used to be charmingly referred to as "barren.") In so doing, they allow a great talent to bloom - sharing it with the world. This brings us to the film's other star, Joshua Bell. Bell provides the actual violin virtuosity behind the scenes, and his technique and range are chilling - from barn dance sawing rowdy enough to set the Strad on fire, to subtle trills that could make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Yes
0	IT IS HARD TO GET MUCH LAMER THAN - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story This movie is the BIG LIE logic attempting to prove itself again. Most despotic criminals use a BIG LIE concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which Stan "Tookie" Williams is cut. This DVD is nothing more than a BIG LIE! that ranks right up there with NAZI BIG LIE era Triumph Of The Will. Like any monster Tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart. This DVD should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how BIG LIES told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls. Even if Stan Tookie" Williams is just responsible for "Helping Create" the Crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book. That he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 Minutes, "convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is, redeemed" is of no consequence whatsoever. Tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods. Tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings. Tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had. Tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order. Tookie Williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer's reality. In the end Tookie Williams got what he deserved a needle ride to Hell's Gate if there is any enternal justice. Buy this Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story DVD if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work. I look at Stan Tookie William's and all I see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his "caged creep conversion" but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way. When I saw this DVD on Stan "Tookie" Williams he reminded me of Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit.) This is a good DVD because Jamie Foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic, self absorbed social parasite in Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story. If Tookie gets a Nobel Prize I think he should be forced to share it with Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction, child killing, weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit
0	Friday the 13th Part 7, The New Blood In "Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood," we get to hear a narrator tell us the backstory. I don't know who the narrator is; the credits don't mention him. It sounds like Donald Sutherland, but I bet it's not. Mr. Narrator reminds us of what has happened to this point in the saga, ending with the fact that at the end of Part 6, Jason was weighted down and drowned in Crystal Lake. Mr. Narrator informs us that "people forget he's down there." This is just stupid. A man responsible for nearly 100 murders in the space of 10 years does not just disappear from public memory. Furthermore, when Tommy Jarvis drowned the bastard in Part 6, surely the cops and scientists would have then retrieved him, picked him apart, and studied him. His hockey mask would be on eBay. There would be an A&E "Biography" episode about him. People don't just "forget he's down there." But the forgetting is necessary for the story to move forward. It will be helpful if you, the viewer, have forgotten a few things, too. For example, remember how in Part 6, Crystal Lake changed its name to Forest Green in order to escape its bloody past? Yeah, go ahead and forget that, because it's Crystal Lake again now. After Mr. Narrator spins his yarn, there's a prologue (which takes place on Friday the 13th -- CREEEE-PY!) in which a little girl who looks like the "Poltergeist" little girl accidentally uses her psychic powers to kill her dad. Surely we all have made errors like this at some point in our lives. It occurs outside the family's house on Crystal Lake, mere feet from where Jason is chained to the lake bottom, "forgotten" by the locals. Next thing you know, it's several years later. The little girl is grown up and named Tina, and she and her Markie Post lookalike mother have returned to the cabin after apparently having been gone awhile. They've returned because Tina's weird psychic/telekinetic abilities have made her a bit freakish, and a psychiatrist named Dr. Crews wants to "help" her, which really means he wants to use her power for his own gain. (Dr. Crews, by the way, is played by Terry Kiser, who also played the corpse in "Weekend at Bernie's." This is an actor whose career consists only of low points.) So while he's trying to get Tina to harness her powers, Tina goes out on the dock and tries to use them to summon back her dead father. Instead, she accidentally summons Jason; whoops! He gets right to work and starts killing teen-agers, who are conveniently located in an adjacent cabin, having a surprise party for someone who doesn't show up because Jason has killed him. It makes you wonder what Jason would do if he were revived on a weekend when no one was anywhere near Crystal Lake. Would he bother hiking into town to kill some folks in a diner? Catch a Greyhound to the next major city? Or just hang out in the woods, waiting for someone to show up? The interesting thing about this movie is that it was directed by John Carl Buechler, whose credits also include "Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College." The second interesting thing about this movie is that it features the return of the unsettling Daisy Duke shorts that men in the 1980s apparently wore ALL THE TIME, if the "Friday the 13th" movies are to be believed. The third interesting thing about this movie is that at last, there is something different to do about Jason. In the past, victims have battled him by running, stumbling, and screaming a lot. Usually they give up pretty easily and just let themselves be killed, often because they want out of the movie. But now we have Tina, whose telekinetic powers are far more effective than mere knives or screaming. Good to see someone putting a little effort into things. Goodness knows the writer, director and actors didn't expend much effort. We won't bother mentioning that the acting and dialogue are atrocious, like they always are. If we don't mention it, maybe you'll forget.
0	Not impressed - A Big Disappointment This dvd barely worked and didn't do any good. This might be good if your potty training a boy. It is very boy oriented. They need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls. How can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training, they are not the same
1	Amazing movie! I first saw this movie on the Family Channel several years ago and fell in love with it! What a great, light hearted, and fun movie! This is "clean" romantic, fun movie to watch. Great actors too! This is one you will want to watch over and over again
1	The REAL Secret! Sandra Magsamen is neither a New Age prophet of personal enrichment nor a Martha Stewart, but both of these types should listen to what she has to say. What she says in this PBS DVD is that we can bring joy to others and strengthen our bonds with others by doing simple, creative things in our everyday lives. The idea seems obvious once you get it (like The Secret), but unlike The Secret, Sandra's message is about GIVING TO OTHERS, and not getting "everything you have ever wanted." Not only is this the real secret to leading a happy life, but it revolves around practical things you can do that really work. You decide: Visualize a Mercedes, or learn how to make your next family gathering a joyful experience
0	Gangsta King Given the subject matter, one could hardly expect a high budget production but what Gangsta King delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick. Understandably Greg "Batman" Davis is seeking to portray Raymond Washington in a favorable light but putting it out that Raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far. Contrary to legend, the crips were violent from day one as were the L.A. gangs which pre-dated their emergence. The most interesting thing about this documentary is Batman's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library. The historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video. Low budget, low quality, low class
1	Smartly funny I don't write reviews, and I don't purhase movies but I'm doing both for this one. What a great movie. In a time when most humor has really stupid sophomoric humor, this movie is smart, fast, clever and unexpectedly expected. Enough said. Rent or buy this movie. Watch it and prepare yourself to watch it again. Get a kleenex because you'll laugh so hard you'll cry.
0	Yes, this is really boring I agree with rigg_vienna. This film is one of the worst of all Agatha Christie movies. The version of 1981 with Sir Peter Ustinov is MUCH better, and not to forget such great actors like Dame Diana Rigg, Dame Maggie Smith or James Mason. If you want "Evil under the sun", forget the new one and buy the classic one from 1981
0	memorable orientalia wasted on poor film stock! Being an Oriental I am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours, although not as extensive as standard Hollywood productions. With Japanese films, whether it was made by a Kurusawa or a more obscure artisan, I can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in pace, inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals, and are generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively substandard. Village of Dreams, while touted as an award winner is a glaring testimony of this stunted Japanese film-making characteristic. Review it yourself. The pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing. It was the same character that can be seen even in Kurusawa's Ran - a &quot;highly acclaimed&quot; work that in my case, I couldn't even view for the third time, because even its DVD resolution has a quality that can only be likened to the eye-view of a person who's suffering his earliest stage of creeping glaucoma. Village of Dreams is so &quot;relaxed&quot; as if the filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they enjoyed in 1940s Japan in an obscure countryside. At the very least, the straight narrative of this film is a consolation, but with RAN, the actions were so hard to follow, you'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking whom. The most unforgivable quality of this DVD transfer is the poor film stock. The picture approximates that of a &quot;third generation&quot; recording of a VHS copy. This means that you'll be sorely dissapointed of having to get a VHS-quality copy COPIED, in turn, from another VHS copy which was copied from the original VHS &quot;master tape&quot;. Of course, the DVD transfer is not at fault, its simply that the Japanese despite their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us a decent film stock, that could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems. The glaring deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious, when shown on high resolution TVs. I've viewed this film in a 29-inch Sony Wega Flat TV, and in a 50-inch Mitsubishi projection TV, from a Pioneer DVL 919 and 909. If not for the antics of the two children leads, Village comes off as wearisome. I bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because I'm a film collector. Its works like this that whets my appreciation for world cinema. Unfortunately, Village's poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment, as well as negating its &quot;collectability&quot; factor. This should have looked more glorious if it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like What Dreams May Come or Dark City, but of course that's asking too much from those editing-challenged Japanese filmakers. I want to ask Amazon for a refund because this is not well worth its price value. I was compulsed to buy it because of its cover, I thought it was at least as exotically glorious-looking as KUNDUN, but it proved to be just a small, obscure production. Critics may raved about it, just like those Canadians did with BLACK ROBE, but the final word is that they're just run of the mill, albeit thoughtful, films....
0	Criterion Collection Stunk! The above entitled collection was a real disappointment. Not at all what I expected and definitely not worth the money. Quite frankly, I was so disappointed I threw them in the trash. I know there has to be good W.C. Fields films out there, however W.C. Fields: 6 Short Films-Criterion Collection is not one of them Bill William
0	The movie is good but the dvd sucks. This is a good movie, but the DVD works like a cheap bootleg. My DVD player was fresh out the box and for some odd reason this DVD kept skipping parts of the movie.
1	It's a Classic and great for ALL!!!!!! You can't help but love this classic. With the garbage that comes out of Hollywood today it's nice to know there are still safe films available for families with values on DVD from yester-year! Should be a Christmas Classic
1	Great As swift as I'd expect to come from the US and is of a fine quality
1	enjoyable, but frankly my dear, id rather be in secaucus i managed to miss this: one of those generational impact movies, and never caught up to it until now. it is difficult to remember that all the cliches were NOT cliches when this movie was released, but i was able to watch it and just enjoy the crisp acting by all 8 stars. and of course there IS that soundtrack. still, the movie ripped off "the return of the secaucus 7", and tho i havent seen that in a long time, my guess is id prefer it on a more core level
0	The ads proudly state "From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie". Need another reason not to see it? The writers of this movie thought that referencing dozens of different movies would make a comedy. No. There has to be jokes, funny jokes. There needs to be something humorously said about the original films to make it a satire. I have seen many of the films this movie "spoofs" including Napoleon Dynamite, When Harry Met Sally, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, The Wedding Planner, Jerry Maguire, Sleepless in Seattle, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and ALL of them are funnier than Date Movie. It really is pointless to spoof comedies. The writers don't even reference date movies all the time. They reference King Kong, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and it doesn't work. Even the so-so Scary Movie films have something to say about the films they are spoofing. Not only was it terribly unfunny, it was sick. I like Monty Python and American Pie but when a cat starts humping a decayed human torso I draw the line. The writers of this film also made Epic Movie. I saw Date Movie on DVD. I will not see Epic Movie ever or any other film made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. It is a sad time in our world and an extremely small part of that sadness is the fact that movies like these are made and make millions at the box office
0	Historically---but not comically---significant Chaplin This 1914 film is considered the first feature-lenth comedy ever made and, as such, is worth viewing just for that. The film on its merits, however, is less interesting. Sure, this is slapstick, but I personally found the Tillie character to be quite ridiculous; ridiulous, moreover, without being particularly amusing. She's made up to look like---and seemingly acts like---a guy in drag pledging a fraternity. Marie Dressler, then 45 years-old, playing such a supposedly youthful character as "Tillie", to boot, is less comical than it is distracting. If you are going to take the time to see this film, in other words, you ought be doing so simply to see a historically significant film. So, no, it's not a film you'll most likely want to own and watch again and again, unless you're simply enamored by anything and everything Chaplin has done. If you haven't seen anything by Chaplin don't start here! And if you are a discerning Chaplin fan you'd be better served (if you care to be amused) by sampling some of his much greater efforts. For the curious, I offer a brief synopsis of Tillie's Punctured Romance: "What's this he's got---one of Ringling's elephants?" So remarks Mabel Normand's character (so to speak, in this silent film) as she spies Chaplin's 'City Guy' arm in arm with "Built like a battleship" Tillie. Tillie has "got a bankroll as thick as herself", Chaplin's character later explains to Normand, his old partner in crime. Then once successful in lifting said cash from Tillie, Chaplin flees with Normand. Upon hearing of Tillie's apparent inheritance of 3 million dollars soon after, however, he returns to her and begs Tillie to marry him ASAP. They later whoop it up with many quests (with Normand working as hired help) at a celebratory party at Tillies's "new" home, until her uncle---thought dead---returns to claim it back, throwing them out into the street as he does so. A keystone-cops-like chase ensues all through town and seaside along a boardwalk and then ends with Normand and (a soaking wet) Tillie agreeing that Chaplin's favor is hardly worth pursuing anyway. Curtain. Cheers!
0	bogged down Liz Hurley has her top off 4 or 5 times; there is incest, lesbian love between sisters-in-law, the main character's husband is having an affair with his brother's girlfriend who really isn't his brother's girlfriend, she really is his girlfriend that was coming along on the boat trip pretending to be his brother's girlfriend so she could meet his wife who happens to be having some psychic connection with a "solved incorrectly" murder from 125 years ago on an island with some Norwegian people. And honest to god the movie is boring. Sean Penn broods, leers, pains, and smokes cigarettes, his wife is played by Catherine McCormack who is like a young Charolette Rampling, very watchable but condemned to a weak role; Liz Hurley acts very vampy and takes her top off (unforgettable): All this and the movie drags, and drags. Liz stops taking her top off at the 1/3 mark which then forces you to realize how bad the movie is. The parallel stories just don't come off. Actually it is a one star movie, Liz taking her top off boots it one extra star

1	Tomcats: Brilliance Below the Imbecility. While ostensibly the worst movie of the 21st century, this paean to masculinity has pushed the feminist movement up by 30 years. How? By exulting in the lowest common denominator of male attributes. Imbecilic jokes abound to entertaining the male masses who must make up the majority of this film's viewers. However, below the surface is brilliance, undercovered only by a select group of cinematic geniuses. To the select few, this film is actually a stark examination of depravity: we are asked to observe B-grade actors be pushed increasingly lower into the depths. We explore what is NOT on the screen, such as the awkward human feeling behind the scenes. One can only imagine the director yelling "Tomcats, Scene 5, Act 4! ACTION!," as Horatio Sanz is asked for the fourteenth time to tell a (...) joke. Thus, if you want to see phallus jokes and dispense high-fives, watch the film. If you want to see a brilliant dissertation of human depravity, check it out.
0	The Party The DVD played semi relevant sub titles (in english) randomly throughout. We were unable to remove them. Absolutly sub-standard.
1	Didn't come with that cover Well we know about this movie for more than 20 years that is one of the best. But Amazon has a photo on cover that does not exist
0	Still a rookie Richard Pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian. I consider him the best in the business. But his performance in &quot;Live and Smokin&quot; shows he's still just a rookie. He's nervous in front of the camera, and says so several times. His material is typically raunchy, but not very funny. You can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience. Buy this tape only if you're a die-hard Pryor fan, but don't expect the side-splitting laughter you'll get from &quot;In Concert&quot;, &quot;Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;, and &quot;Here and Now&quot;
0	Extremely Disappointing I love Eddie Murphy, and I loved Dr. Doolittle! The previews of Dr. D II looked so funny, I couldn't wait to see it. Well, I just saw it, and my mind has still not recovered. Dr. Doolittle 2 is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story and dialouge are so mind-numbing, even the animated Murphy and Raven Symone, who plays his teenage daughter, couldn't salvage it. The story revolves around Dr. Doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer. To do this, Doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild, because this bear is an endangered species, and if he lives in the forest, the developer can't touch it. Sounds kind of cute . . . it's not. The bear acts and sounds like a washed up Vegas lounge singer. His whiny voice (Steve Zahn) is so annoying that even I, a passionate animal lover, could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear. And talk about long. This whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until I writhed in pain. And the other animals! A sad, alcoholic French monkey, a chamelon with a horrible Mexican accent, and an abusive bear and his passive female bear. When the bear is not whining, a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal, bland voice with HORRIBLE dialouge. A subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot, is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights. Murphy actually acquieses. What an intelligent, lovely girl like Raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable. It is hard to believe people (and animals) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film. It seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge, and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and I don't blame them
1	GREATEST MOVIE EVER THIS IS THE BEST FILM I"VE SEEN IN MY LIFE. I HOPE THERE"S A PREQUAL. I HAVE IT ON 9 DVDS. ITS BRILLIANT
0	They should have an alternate beginning where Orlando Bloom does kill himself Orlando Bloom tries to act too cute by trying to channel the karma of Johnny Depp, and it just does not work. Kirsten Dunst basically just acts cute throughout the whole movie. So, if you like movies about two cute people acting cute, then this movie is for you.
1	The Man Who Would Be King This is one of the best Adventure films I have ever seen. Wonderous, full of Humor and Action. Great performances of Sean Connery and Michael Caine. And all that before the Golden Age of special (computer generated) effects. A masterpiece which I never tire of seeing. And every time the ending makes me feel a bit sad and feeling sorry for Daniel and Peachy. They deserve better.

1	Wes Craven: Man of Mystery and Movies Wes Craven, the man who has written, directed, produced, or edited more than 30 television and feature films such as &quot;Last House on the Left&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, and the recent &quot;Scream&quot; trilogy, is finally revealed here in the popular &quot;The Directors&quot; series. Wes speaks highly and thoroughly about the making of his films, but keeps quiet about his personal life which he has always done and I respect. Though, it is very informative about his feature films, this DVD neglects to mention almost none of his television work like the new &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; of the 80's and his short lived &quot;Nightmare Cafe&quot; series. Any fans of &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot; will be sorley disappointed as they pretty much mention the title then move onto &quot;Wes Craven's New Nightmare.&quot; What can you expect, they had to squeeze 15 films into one hour. Other than that the DVD is great. Wes Craven fans should check it out
1	what a classic, glad i own it this is one of those great and rare movies from the 80'S that you cannot find in any video stores. i know there is some person out there saying " well who wants to rent it" to often to many times we get caught up in our own generation with our own music,movies and all the new things that technology has put out there to even give a movie a chance from a different era. i collect alot of movies and have tried to collect ones i watched when i was growing up such as TOURIST TRAP, CURTAINS., AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE. Today there are a lot of movies being remade like The Amityville horror and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre please do yourself a favor and watch these movies that were first made and copied so poorly also give the actors from the original movies a chance such as james brolin,marilyn burns and gunnar hansen as leatherface these are true and serious actors they really had to act, todays stars are usually standing in front of a green screen. i have to admit i do own some of the remakes but there will always only be the originals first. thanks yvonne and steiger you rule
0	Great acting, but by the end you won't care for any of the three protagonists I came to this page struggling with how to encapsulate my take on 'Dying Gaul,' but I see that amazon reviewer Josh Lanyon has nailed it perfectly: "The actors were brilliant and the thing is so beautifully shot--the music, mood, the little touches--all great. And all rather beside the point." Exactly. Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard are all spectacular here. I thought Scott was the standout. And, the movie looks incredible. But the dark mood of the movie got darker and darker...and simply less likable. By the end, you won't care for any of the three protagonists. I watched the movie with two other people. None of us liked the ending...nor did it matter by that point. We just wanted it to end. We were intrigued by the presence of an 'alternate ending' on the DVD. It's basically the same ending, but it goes on a bit longer and only confirms that the ambiguity of the released ending was intended (one character expresses the ambiguity in a voice over)
0	Corregidor As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer it for sale is unbeleivable
1	Uneven quality, but still excellent I was disappointed in the quality of some of the episodes in this collection. They looked as though someone had skipped over them during the digital cleanup for DVD. A tad washed out. Other than that, it was outstanding. I'd recommend it to anyone
1	Funny and different If Mel Brooks was into old Kung Fu movies instead of old Westerns, this would be the result.
1	Hillarious Very Funny. My dad gave me this for my birthday,and I laughed my but off. It was kind of depressing since he was a raging alcholoic, but in the end, that is what makes hime the most fuinny. Cheap and a classic
0	Terrible!!! Terrible movie... I really like Denzel Washington as an actor but in this movie it was very dissapointing... he is much better when he plays to be a good person that fights for justice and what is right
1	Pretty Good Flick The single shot camera action in the beginning is a bit nauseating, but it adds to the affect of the storyline very well. Simply done and well acted. This one's worth seeing just figuring out the story. Graphically realistic situation that can happen to anyone.
0	Total TRASH! Don't even think about wasting your money!! The 1st "movie": Fist of Fear, Touch of Death is so bad I didn't even watch the next 2. The uninitiated will possibly not know that the footage that purports to be about Bruce's life, family and ancestry is all rubbish and was actually taken from 2 different movies: The ancestors "cuts" in color are from a colossally poor period piece that would be funny if it didn't seem to be taking itself seriously. While the black and white parents-and-family "cuts" actually are truly a young Bruce in a Hong Kong film that he made before returning to the U.S. to live. However the scenario is totally misrepresented. All of the other participants are actors as well and not correctly identified. Nor is the dubbed dialog related to what is really being spoken (in Cantonese) by the actors. Yet a third source is tapped for the "supposed interviews" which are not with the speaker at all, but with someone else regarding the work Bruce did on the "Longstreet" TV show in '71 and once again the voice-over not only is not really Bruce and is again, not accurate (and he was speaking English during those interviews). One would be better served to buy the "Legend" DVD from the -Bruce Lee Master Collection- or the more recent "Bruce Lee: The Warrior's Journey" to see and hear in Bruce's own words and voice what the NON-"What's Up Tiger-Lily" version is of the early Hong Kong (black and white) and what the "Longstreet" interviews have to reveal about him. If this is meant to be a spoof and they just forgot to mention that anywhere, then shame on them. I don't find it even remotely humorous, not to consider the generations of people who might not know any better since his untimely death 32 years ago.
1	A Sharon Stone Porn Movie! One line.....great sex scenes. Sharon, you little sl**! Watch it and beat it
0	Zero chemistry Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Talk of Angels&quot; could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest
1	"But carrots don't grow on trees!" It doesn't matter how you like your humor, straight up, or on the rocks, the Black Adder is your man. from the "Foretelling", where between liberal interpretation of W.S. combined with the ruthless, crazy, humor likened to the Firesign Theater, and a deep well of humor about their own "bloody" history, to the end of the disc-"The Black Seal", if you don't laugh for at least 90 minutes of its 180 minute length, and this goes for the first 3 Black Adder disc's, and come away with a tired mind, keeping up with all the historical references, fractured or not, spun off by the excellent writing team of Curtis & Elton, along with a small cast of veteran Engligh actors, Peter Cook, Brian Blessed, anon, anon, then I say you better have your funny bone looked after, because you are in danger of loosing your sense of humor. Also I would suggest buying a copy of The Black Adder by Penguin Books. It will help, when the humor comes too fast and is in the kings english, because you do not want to miss one joke, reference, or twisted tale of this disc.
1	The dark side of attachment Reage's O is the best-known of the SM novels, one of very few that has made it into the general awareness. This movie is a truncated version of the story, with some interesting differences. A movie is a visual presentation, so many details have been added or filled in. In that respect, the movie carries indelible marks of its 1970s origin - bell-bottom side burns, wide ties, and Farrah Fawcett hair for some of the women. Bust implants were mostly unknown in the 70s, so the female figures are more natural and varied than in newer flicks, too. And, this movie comes from the time when "safe sex" meant not falling out of bed. In an effort to approach main-stream audiences, many of the book's more repugnant elements have been dropped. Still, here's plenty of eroticism left in numerous synthesexual engagements. The movie's pervasive theme of control, submission, and pain is intact. It will turn many people off - it was never meant to appeal to everyone, and doesn't much appeal to me. The very last scene of the movie is a surprise, though. It's quite unlike the book, and somehow made everything else make a lot more sense. //wiredweir
0	Plot, plot, and then more plot A very intricate, involved thriller about a special effects man, an expert in disguise, and a plan to fake the death of a mafia kingpin who is about to talk to the authorities. All kinds of double dealings are going on here; in fact, so much story is going on with so little attention to character development that after it's over it all quickly begins to evaporate from your memory. Quickly forgettable. Bill Conti wrote the music, which is interesting
0	I can't believe I wasted my time with this..... This movie is absolutley horrible. I heard it was an underground funny movie and was told it's a must watch. I think the only reason I made it through the whole thing was I kept waiting for the funny parts, next thing I know, the credits were rolling. BLEACH! Amazingly awful
1	Classic--Must have This is the version of this film to have. Many other versions are out there but the quality of those are severely lacking. The film is outstandingly clear and every bit as wonderful as I remembered. The vast array of special features are fascinating. This is the one John Wayne film everyone should have
1	The whole Movies - I've Seen EM!

See my Pokemon 3 review
1	Slow Flow with an Iyengar twist This DVD was great if you want a slower flowing yoga DVD. I think this DVD is good for just about anybody familiar with yoga, and how to use yoga blocks. Seane starts off slowly with meditation, breathing exercises, and then slowly starts going into the actual postures. The postures themselves were not difficult for advanced beginner and up practioners. However, Seane goes through these postures slowly enough where you will start to feel different parts of your body open up. Seane pays a fair amount of attention to alignment (moreso than I am use to seeing in a Vinyasa Flow type DVD). She takes her time getting into and out of the postures and this where I feel anyone can benefit from this DVD. If you are the type of person looking for a Vinyasa Flow DVD to make you move, sweat, drop a few pounds, or want very challenging postures, then this probably is not the DVD for you. I would suggest Shiva Rae's Yoga Shakti DVD which has something for almost every skill level, except maybe the truly gifted and advanced yogis/yoginis out there (the arm balances she does are almost all intermediate to advanced). However, if you want to really focus on the alignment and feeling of some of the more basic postures, and you are looking for something slower than the average flow yoga DVD, then this is a home run
0	Throw plausibility out the window in this stinker We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours
0	When I was little I used to love VanDamme, and it's sad that he's come to this! I am in my twenties now and am more into drama films and trendy artistic films from foreign countries (chalk that up to my wife's influence on me), but I still have a guilty predeliction for unapologetically mindless action movies where things blow up, bad guys do bad things for no apparent reason, and (of course) a heroic character defeats countless enemies using martial arts and other cool fighting techniques, while those same countless numbers of villains fail to kill him despite firing millions of rounds of machine gun ammunition at him. I used to love Van Damme movies when I was aged 8-14, back when he was making better films, although I've always considered him a subpar actor (the same is also true, in my opinion, for Arnold Swarzennegger). I thought his martial arts scenes in movies like Bloodsport and Kickboxer were worth the rental price (or, in those days, asking my mom or dad to rent them for me). Then came 1995's Timecop, and I absolutely loved that movie (as a child -- now it seems kind of tame and not as good as I remembered it). I thought VanDaame was finally becoming a better actor and fast on his way to being a megastar. Unfortunately, VanDamme's career has faded since then, after a string of box-office and critical failures, and he has become more of a B-grade star and direct-to-video actor a-la Michael Dudinkoff (American Ninja). It's good to see that he's still working, but it seems like his work is really sucking right now. One exception might be 2000's Legionnaire, a VanDamme movie that is surprisingly good, though certainly no Hard Target -- a movie from his glory days. For me, I think one of the biggest reasons why Van Damme is on a downward spiral as far as his movies go (aside from his lousy acting) is because he's lost credibility as a martial arts virtuoso. I chalk this up to the time he allegedly got beat up at a nightclub. In the version I heard, Van Damme was purportedly behaving in an obnoxious manner in the club, and security naturally confronted him and asked him to moderate his behavior, or leave. Van Damme then allegedly began mouthing off at the security guard (a beefy skinhead-looking guy) and performing various martial arts moves apparently designed to intimidate the other guy. The other guy, I guess, wasn't impressed because he then decked Van Damme with one right cross and Van Damme left the club on a stretcher. Sigh. How the mighty have fallen. Oh, by the way, Second in Command sucks.
0	What happened?? Horrible, boring film from one of my top 10 favorite directors. The only thing worth seeing is the amazing &quot;tiara&quot; of candles that Goya (supposedly?) uses to paint at night. BORING!
0	And now you see how our state was suckered into the oil biz I came upon this film while browsing my university library. My curiosity was picqued, since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking (Mardi Gras) and eating (Cajun food). This film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in Jean Lafitte National Park. Looking out over a marsh (through which runs a large gas pipeline), the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell-Texaco, et al., all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands. If they're cleaning anything, it's their own mess. And what methods are they using? "Bio-restorative detonations," I believe, was the term used. Are those "life-giving bombs"? Back to the film, funded as propaganda by Standard Oil Co. when local sentiment was turning against the company. I'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled Cajuns smile broadly at the blessed Oil Rig plopped in their marsh, and the way the young boy is given the Disney-nature-film treatment, as amusingly naive as Lobo the Wolf or Henry the Mountain Burro. No, just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state. And then visit the beautiful scenery of Norco, LA, in the middle of the famed Cancer Alley
1	My feet and quads thank you! I bought this DVD last year and when I fell off of the exercise wagon, this was relegated to a drawer in the entertainment center. After doing a Kathy Smith weight lifting routine last night, I picked this back up to stretch right before bed with the PM routine. I'm 32, and have been underweight and very flexible my entire life. But even I needed improvement, and along with cardio and weight training, I've incorporated yoga and pilates into my recently revived exercise routine. My feet hurt from high heels. My quads are too weak, and I fear hurting my knees until my quads are stronger. The stretches in the PM section for the quads and feet (love the massage!) were so good that for those reasons alone I'm committing to doing this every night to get the day's kinks out. Lewis instructs you to start a stretch, contract a muscle, and then deepen the stretch. I haven't seen this technique anywhere else, and I think it's a wonderful method for improving flexibility. Unfortunately, it's only Noon right now and nowhere near bedtime. I'm already looking forward to doing this one again. One day I'll get up early enough to do the AM routine....
0	1 star is too much - way too much The release of films such as these by Fox can do nothing but bury L and H. All of their 40s films are awful and it's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these. To see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased. Only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why L and H are ranked up there with Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton. These two warm and wonderful men don't deserve this - and neither do you.
0	Disappointed I had high hopes for this. After spending $24.95 to buy it, and watching the first disc, I don't even feel inspired to watch the other discs. I am an alcoholic myself, and have been sober (thanks to AA) for 11 plus years. I work in the medical field, and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis. I found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing. Perhaps it just shows the hunger of the American people to learn SOMETHING, ANYTHING about the subject of addiction. It IS a complex subject, and I didn't find any answers here. I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was. If it was strictly to educate, I found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that DID'T include some of the most important ideas about addiction. It was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you couldn't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing, to boot! If it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction, I didn't feel in the least bit inspired. I did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling, or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling. I left the show vaguely confused, not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers. There were exceptions, of course. I enjoyed the Night in the ED segment, and I found the Steamfitters to be very "real" and human. Addiction IS a terrible disease, and it deserves better treatment than this. Probably the main thing that I did NOT like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards "magic bullet" thinking, which does a disservice to the addict. That is, over and over are mentioned "exciting new medicines" and "getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict", which I find dangerous and misleading. That is, it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new "miracle" drugs touted. Perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry. "Miracle drugs" which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years (antabuse and SSRI antidepressants come to mind), and none have a very impressive track record. In fairness to the show, they do mention some of this, but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next "miracle drug". I was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans, scientific speculation, and such, that there was NO mention whatsoever of any 12 step program, or any proven treatment center such as Hazeldon or the Betty Ford clinic. Because the reality is, while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine, there are real humans out there in the world who are SUCCESSFULLY HELPING THEIR FELLOW HUMANS TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER. What a concept! And without miracle drugs even! Getting clean and sober is not easy, and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything, and b) not to mention real life programs available now (often free) that have proven track records, and offer REAL hope. If you like science, be aware that Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown SCIENTIFICALLY in study after study to have THE SINGLE BEST TRACK RECORD AT KEEPING ALCOHOLICS SOBER. Is it for everyone? No, but if you want to get (and more importantly STAY) sober, the odds are better with AA as a follow-up (after initial treatment) than with anything else that you can name. "It works if you work it" as they say in AA. I have no direct experience with other 12 step programs, and so can't comment, but I know that they operate very similarly. WHY on a show about addiction would they not mention any 12 step program? I sat with my jaw hanging down as I watched the entire show, and AA was only mentioned twice: once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for 17 years or something "through AA", (that in itself is an amazing accomplishment, and should say all you need to know about AA), and later in the show on the Steamfitters who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to AA would be somehow 'wimpy' for manly men like them. I don't where they got that impression, because I've never heard of AA being called 'wimpy' (or whatever term they used). AA's full of bikers, construction workers, etc., right alongside the doctors and lawyers. That's the beauty of it: it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries, and shows what we addicts have IN COMMON. The irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE AN AA GROUP AND MEETING! I was laughing - there was almost no difference. So if you want to know what an AA meeting is like, watch the steamfitters. The sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts. And the power of "it takes one to know one" that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why AA is so effective. Who wants to listen to a scientist? If you're an addict or an alcoholic, you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic. They've walked a mile in your shoes. So to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah, blah, blah with little real inspirational meat or insight. If you want some real scientific insight into how this "brain disease" works (at least the alcoholic version), try the book "Beyond the Influence", available from Amazon. Good meat there. If you want to see some good talk from people who have (to me) better insight into the whole addiction thing, search online for the Larry King Live addiction show which featured Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty Ford's daughter from the Betty Ford clinic. Transcripts are available online. It was an incredible show. Coincidentally, one of the "researchers" who appears on the HBO special was also on the Larry King show, and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level. You will see what I'm talking about.
0	Lousy lousy lousy Contentwise, I won't toss darts OR roses. This is genre stuff. You either like it or you don't. My beef is with the technical quality. It is execrable. (1) It is NOT in widescreen (Cinemascope), which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular. There is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a DVD issued in the year 2000. (2) The so-called "digital remastering" must be kitchen-table grade, because the shapes are fuzzy, colors oversaturated, visuals mushy. This DVD should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted. I get better quality from my VHS of this movie than the DVD I purchased. Lousy lousy lousy, as I said.
1	gift for son-in-law, He loved it, Pumping Iron 25th Anv. Son-in-law really liked it, he is a weight lifting lover
0	Car 54,where are you?What about Studio 54? Saw this movie once&don't want to see it again. Jim Carrey,before getting more mature roles in "Man in the Moon","Eternal Sunshine"&"Truman Show",indulges in endless slapstick,gets plenty of gross-out humor,beds Courtney Cox (before "Friends",David Arquette&baby Coco)&finds out oh!the horror!the horror!he's kissed a man.Since this was before "Brokeback"&Heath&Jake won their Best Kiss from the MTV movie awards,Jim goes through an elaborate "purification" ceremony. It relies on gags;this isn't a great movie.It ranks with "Wild Wild West" as one of the worst.Do yourself a favor&avoid this movie
0	Poor at Best I have this little (very little) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys. Currently "The Yards" and "Ghost World" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf. I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it. Slow story, not enough character development. All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is
1	An enlightening and mesmerizing film! This is a good movie with comments to make on many levels. It shows the heartache that one couple has to overcome after losing a child. There is a certain poetic justice about the stupidity of a nanny putting herself in jeopardy, a pleasant, caring woman who has been breaking the law for 16 years. Then there is the story of two boys who play their rifle games oblivious to what harm they are doing to other people, completely innocent people. Does their culture create people, even young ones, who are so irresponsible? Today's newspapers confirm the film's answer . . a resounding yes. And, attached to the film's plot by a very slender thread, the Japanese girl has pain that can be felt by everyone watching her, including the audience. I wouldn't necessarily call this film enjoyable, but it is an enlightening and mesmerizing film. It also has probably the best role that Brad Pitt has ever had or played.
1	Great Set This set is great for early film buffs. But, since most of them are in the public domain, they are easily found online at government sites to download free. Spending a few hours downloading from the Library of Congress site, and you will have the same collection
0	Could have been worse... Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006) Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks. Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on. Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. *
1	Henry V This is a wonderful production of Henry V. The acting is magnificant, I would highly recommend this DVD.
0	Blah... I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched. Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American. Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood. So I thought I would give this one a try. I really wanted to like this movie. It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick. I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop). Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it. Way too thick for me
0	disappointed after reading the reviews from pbs i was excited to see the film. im so happy i rented it as opposed to getting it from here, which i would have done had i not found it somewhere else. while all the teachers had great intentions, it was obvious they were not equipped with the skills needed to engage the children in a community/learning environment. from observing body language and facial expressions in some of the classes, the children were not engaged (notice how they lit up when they were finally engaged through the photo project!). the answers to questions about behavior were the answers that the teachers wanted to hear and the teachers knew it. if they watched the video, i hope they would take not at how they talked to the students (a couple teachers in particular). getting angry, answering your own question, making students write why they wont misbehave anymore, etc. are old school ways of gaining compliance and they wont reach todays children. this video would not make me want to be a teacher, if anything, it shows just how much preservice teachers need to be exposed to various cultures, they need to learn how to build a community in the classroom, and they need mentors who are aware of the needs of diverse learners. in order to attract students to a profession, make a video that highlights teachers who are able to make a difference despite the odds, schools that have made drastic turnarounds, and students who excel when they should be another negative statistic. there are some positive things in the video, they are just overshadowed by the other stuff. and, yes, i agree with a previous writer. another video could have been used in the classroom to expose students to the lives of homosexuals
0	Film Noir in Living Color I find it insulting that not only does the woman like the guy for treatign her like garbage, being rude, insulting, and abusive, but she likes it, and still sees him after he nearly rapes her. That sort of thing sends a bad message. Real men don't behave that way--only inferior males with severe psychological damage. Seems all the characters in this movie are messed up. Colin Farrel's character was teased as a child for being Italian, so now he's a mysogynist bigot. Selma Hayek's character is Mexican, can't read English, so she's willing to but up with physical and mental abuse, and has TB, possiblly from her bartender friend. The bartender definately has TB, and wants to be a writer, just like everyone living in Los Angeles. Donald Sutherland's character is a drunk. He has about 10 minutes of screen time. There's another woman who is badly burned (no information is given on how this happened) over a large portion of her body. This causes her to latch onto various passing males with a fierce attachment that borders on psychotic. Of the characters, she probablly has the best explanation for being messed up, though the form the writer took to show it is dubious. And there are two scenes which could have been totally cut from the movie without any loss to the story. There's a nude midnight swim in the freezing cold ocean. And of course, there's the prolonged bare-backside sex scene, where the camera seems fascinated with every pore and folicle in Colin Ferral's glutious maximus. The story doesn't really move, and the resolution doesn't satisfy. While pretty, the attempt to capture the period is ultimately unsuccessful. And the earthquake scene is so stupid and poorly executed that the thing is laughable. Between this movie, Tigerland, PhoneBooth, and Alexander, I have to wonder how Colin Ferrel ever got a career started. It certainly wasn't based on acting tallent. Seems to have more to do with his willingness to have his bare posterior on film
1	"Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these... ...it might have been." In the early to mid 50's, many studios were churning out comedies, perhaps more so in an effort to get people past those old post war blues, but few did it as well or consistently as the British Ealing Studios (in my humble opinion), helped immensely by the talents of Alec Guinness...what?! Alec Guinness a comedic actor? The same Alec Guinness who starred in such serious films as The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), and A Passage to India (1984)? Yes, it seemed by the end of the 1950's, Guinness had pretty much dedicated himself to more serious parts, but not altogether as he later appeared in the fantastic comedy Murder by Death (1976), which I recommend to anybody in search of a truly good laugh. While many consider The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) to be one of the best of the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I'm partial to one of their later films, The Ladykillers (1955), which was recently remade by the Coen brothers and featured Tom Hanks (I've haven't seen it yet, but I heard not so good things about it). Directed by Charles Crichton (The Titfield Thunderbolt, A Fish Called Wanda), the film stars, along with Guinness, Stanley Holloway (Nicholas Nickleby, Passport to Pimlico). Also appearing is Sid James (The 39 Steps, Upstairs and Downstairs) and Alfie Bass (The Fearless Vampire Killers, Revenge of the Pink Panther). This comedic caper begins in a tropical setting, where we meet a man named Henry Holland (Guinness), who seems quite popular probably because of the fact he's pretty free with his money. He thus begins to relate a tale to another man, taking us into a flashback that makes up the rest of the film and we learn Holland, prior to being a somewhat well to do philanthropist sort in South America, actually came from humble beginnings as in a previous life he was a mild mannered bank worker, responsible for regularly escorting gold shipments from the smelting facility (that's where they take the raw gold and turn it into bars), to the bank. His coworkers and superiors look upon him as a quiet, by the book sort with no ambition, imagination, or initiative, as `his one and only virtue is honesty'. And that's exactly the way Holland likes it...especially since he aspires to one day steal one of shipments of gold and live out his days well beyond his current means. The only problem is, once stolen, gold bars are extremely difficult to transfer into cash...but a solution soon presents itself in the form of a new tenant to the boarding house Holland resides, one named Alfred Pendlebury (Holloway)...the name of the tenant, not the boarding house...Mr. Pendlebury just happens to operate a modest die casting business, one whose specialty is producing paperweights, one perfectly suited for Holland's needs. Soon the die is cast (so to speak), and the pieces are in place, but, as everyone knows, even the best-laid plans are subject to disaster once in the implementation stage as the human element is always the most unpredictable. As I said before, of all the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I prefer The Ladykillers most of all, probably due to the darker tone of the material and more outlandish nature of the characters, but that's not to say this film isn't of superior quality, as it won an Academy Award for best writing, story and screenplay, and earned Guinness his first nomination (Gary Cooper won for his role in High Noon). One of things I like most about these older comedies is they don't pander to the lowest common denominator in terms of comedic content, but rather speak to the audience with respect, maintaining a consistent level of intelligence not so often seen nowadays...but that's not to say this couldn't be enjoyed by anyone. I had originally seen this film quite a number of years ago, and appreciated it for the more visual elements as opposed to last night when I enjoyed the more subtle aspects due to a general understanding one usually gains with maturity. Regardless, this is one of those films where everything works well together to bring about a wonderful story. The direction is exceptionally strong and wastes none of the films lean 81 minutes running time. Guinness is about as good as you'll ever see him, fostering a belief that he is, now and forever, the meticulous, level-headed, slightly devious character of Henry Holland (at least until his next film), but is certainly assisted (nearly upstaged) by his costar Holloway, the romantic character, yearning to express his artistic nature, stifled by the drudgery of actually having to earn a living through the mass production of tourist souvenirs. There are any number of wonderful scenes and sequences presented throughout the film, but two come to my mind as being my favorites. One features Mr. Pendlebury moving into the boarding house where Holland lives, and Holland learning of Pendlebury's profession which sets in motion him gingerly broaching the possibility of utilizing Pendlebury's die casting business as a means to process the stolen booty. Holland and Pendlebury, both eventually on the same page, begin almost convincing each other and themselves of the very real possibility that it can be done...the other is the scene where Holland and Pendlebury go about enlisting a couple of extra, but necessary, members for the gang, as the gold shipment is too much for the two of them to handle themselves. It's not like you can put an ad out in the paper for such a thing, so they utilize a very unique method to contact prospective applicants. And there's a bonus! If you love classic movies, you'll be in for a treat...watch for the appearance of a minor character, played by a soon to be legendary actress, about three or four minutes into the film...yes, that's who you think it is...but don't blink, or you'll miss it... Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a very clean and clear full screen (original aspect ratio) picture on this DVD, with a decent Dolby Digital mono audio. Special features include an original theatrical trailer, and an extensive Alec Guinness biography and liner notes. By the way, I heard there is a remake of this film in the works, scheduled to be released in 2006...I guess time will tell if it's any good or not, but the way I see it, what's the point? I hardly see how they could improve upon the original... Cookieman108 By the way, there is, as I write this, an Alec Guinness DVD set offered by Anchor Bay Entertainment featuring five of his early comedies, including this one, offered at a price that is cheaper than purchasing these DVDs separately, so if you're interested, it might be worth looking into...
0	revolting prelude I hate this film and "The Ballad of Cable Hoge," because of its depiction of animal cruelty. This happens just at the prelude of both films.
0	Horrible DO NOT WATCH THIS GARBAGE! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm honestly upset with the other reviewers here for misleading me so badly. This film is so bad, with so many problems I don't know where to even begin. I can only hope that someone on the verge of watching this changes their mind after reading this review. If I saved one person from buying/watching this disaster, then I have done my job. At the very least buy it from the used bin, that's where mine will be
0	Not For Kids Got it for the kids. After watching the first few, everyone agreed that we should not have purchased it. Good story, but too much gender content. Gets young kids thinking about what is underneath the clothing ... Sad
1	Strength and perseverance This is a good movie. Thora Birch is convincing. The story is incredible. Sometimes it is a little slow but it's worth the time one takes to see it. It's inspirational.
1	uplifting Can you believe I just saw this movie. I had the pleasure of listening to Liz Murray at an AWHONN convention. It's not even that she is a seasoned speaker...she told her story. I instantly was drawn to her. If you think you have problems...well you can hardly believe someone could overcome all that she has. I left that convention with a whole different attitude about life. I can hardly wait for my girls to watch it, because all I have done is talk about her
0	Really unfunny movie, baby! Boy, was this a disappointment. The Curmudgeon was a big fan of the first movie, a clever parody of Bond movies, but it seems the ol' creative and comic barrel had ran empty this time around. God knows what drivel they put out for the third film - I was not tempted to see that. So what's the problem(s)? Well, for one - Austin Powers. He's just not funny in this, in fact he's just downright annoying. Once the scenes begin to go on you realise just how much of a 2-D character he really is. No-one expects a fully realised emotional character, but a little range and depth would work wonders. You can actually see Myers struggling as the movie continues. We'll pass by the unfunny names which were covered in the opening review, and talk about Dr Evil. The best character in the first (and still in this) has also been spoiled - maybe it's too much of him or.. I dunno. Oh, wait - yes I do. They have him RAP. Nice one Mike - let's make a character do something he would NEVER do for the sake of a cheap laugh. Yeah, it's a comedy, but even characters should have limits and contexts, and Dr Evil was just ruined after that. Mini-Me is a failure, his only contributions are giving the finger to people. Oh, my sides. Plus, when you add in Fat Bastard, a tedious "baby-eater" with Myers horrific attempt at a Scottish accent, you aren't so much rolling in the aisles as charging up them towards the exit. This movie would probably have scored two stars, but I'm deducting another for all the idiots who thought it original and amusing to say "Grooooooovy baby" etc and think they were the King Of Comedy. Hey, my reviews my rules
0	A few amusing moments ... could have been much better I agree with some of the other reviewers that the selection of sketches here is not as good as it could have been. Gilda Radner was a very talented comedy actress but this DVD does not showcase enough of her best work. Sure, the dance number with Steve Martin is a classic, as are a couple of the commercials such as "Hey, You," but too many of these sketches show her playing a little girl, Lisa Loopner or the usually gross Roseanne Roseannadanna. It focuses too much on her as an individual, not the integral part of the SNL ensemble that she was. One of the major mistakes the producers of this and the other SNL videos I have seen is that when they take the sketches out of context they are much less funny in isolation than in the flow of a regular show. I was disappointed with this, I didn't chuckle as much as I thought I would and had to skip through many of the sketches because they either rapidly got boring, or gross. I won't be getting any more of these SNL compilation DVDs because they simply don't know how to produce them so that they are funny. I noticed a similar problem with an SNL 25th anniversary compilation. I think perhaps these are written and produced by the same people who write and produce the current SNL show -- which is very rarely even amusing and usually just a waste of time
1	Woody is soooo young here Very funny for Woody's first full length feature. He's an incompetant bank robber and his wife is a laundress. Enjoy
0	Can I get a refund for that ninety minutes of my life? Tangled (Jay Lowi, 2001) Shawn Hatosy has been doing the character-actor thing in Hollywood for a long time. Lowi, in his first feature film, gives Hatosy a starring role, and pairs him opposite established stars Rachael Leigh Cook (Antitrust) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Titus), as well as throwing Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos) into the mix-- and he still can't come up with a good movie. Now, I'll watch Jonathan Rhys Meyers in anything, and I have, and I still had trouble with this mess. The basic idea: David Klein (Hatosy) wakes up in a hospital with a police detective (Bracco) at his side. It seems Kelin's girlfriend Jenny (Cook) and his best friend Alan Hammond (Meyers) are both missing from the wreckage of Hammond's car, where Klein was found. Klein relates the story of the relationship between the three of them to the detective, piecemeal, with scenes from the present intercut. Predictable, boring, cliched, two-dimensional, need I go on? If the ending of Jodi Picoult novels comes as a shock to you, you may find the big reveal here to be a surprise. No one else will. *
0	Always Raunchy, Often Disgusting, Rarely Funny And definitely not worth buying. This movie dishes out nastiness that makes Friday the 13th seem quaint and lovable by comparison. Jay and Silent Bob are rotten people, and you will feel rotten after watching this fitlth. You might laugh a time or two, but you won't feel good about doing it.
0	Dissapointing Movie A poor documentary. An attempt to make porn acceptable and very unsexy at that. A repulsive movie. Watch instead the recent made for TV series entitled Rome. The series Rome is accurate and entertaining and without a doubt the best of its type ever made
1	Happiness is -To Follow that Dream The story of a squatter family is a rollicking success. Arthur O'Connell as the pappy is hilarious. The dialogue is cleaver and Elvis plays the roll of an innocent, not very well educated young beefcake to perfection. The laughter starts as the movie begins to roll and continues throughout. There are not many songs in the movie by Elvis does sing the beautiful "Angel" to a starry eyed Anne Helm. I found that the 97 minutes flew by and the movie had a "feel good" effect on me. The true sign of good entertainment.
1	Dreamgirls I went to the movies with the thought that I probably would not like this mover and was pleasantly surprised. I love the freshness that all of the actors brought to their roles. I am not what you call a Beyonce fan, but I found myself enjoying her in this role. I have always loved musicals and can't wait to add this one to my collection. My grandchildren loved this movie as well and constantly sing all the songs.
1	No Problems I purchased all four season on July 17th. There has been no problems with the discs. I hope others will purchase these so that all eight seasons will be available for fans
1	"smeggin' awesome" If seasons 1 and 2 of this fantasticly written, orginal series were good, season three is...well, think of a good word for even better and plug it in. In the orginal first two seasons the gags were based mostly on dialouge. While they were still hysterical, season three can bost more action-based and even funnier gags, such as the killer-kebab. Plus the dialouge is still up to its old standards, anything but shoddy. The only dissapointing thing about this season is that the actor who plays Holly leaves (I belive he quit because they weren't paying him as much as the others)and is replaced by the actress who played "Hilly" in the plaralell universe. I'm sorry, but she just doesn't have the same comedic air as the "original Holly". Other than that, the show only gets better. And the trend continues with Season four
1	Suprisingly wicked and funny... lots of twists and turns Another good movie with rupert everett...he simply has a good sense of humor that flows naturally in all the characters he portray especially in this movie. Cate blanchett is spectacular. I would say, this movie has a very unpredictable and funny,some evil plot but not a boring story at all. My husband and i simply love this movie. He has to thank me over and over again for getting this for his valentine gift
1	Exciting Entertaining romantic fairy-tale with Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields. The pretty Emmeline and her attractive companion Richard, after being shipwrecked, land on a lush tropical island. Over the years their mutual affection develops into a beautiful, innocent love relationship. But their paradise doesn't stay undisturbed. Very lovely movie performance about that what dreams are made of
1	Excellent both Nude and Clothed I've owned this DVD for some time now. I've watched it several times and enjoyed it very much each and every time. The women are beautiful and seem to be really having fun as they exercise, especially nude. The clothed version is very nice, too. Of course, being a guy, I prefer them nude. I also like the fact tha the four women seem to have no modesty at all-- they never tried to cover up or hide anything; in fact, sometimes they seemed to be exposed a little more than necessary (no complaints here!). I like this DVD very much and would recommend it to any man who wants to enjoy watching beautiful nude women, also to any man who wants to get his wife to exercise (especially nude and beautiful)
0	terrible casts, bad screenplay, bad directing..... this is the first jane austen's novel that was poorly done into a movie. i could never imagine that bbc would did such a bad job. all the casts are so bad, the screenplay, my god, is so bad that it would take a great deal of patience to watch along and stay in a sitting position. all the casts are so bad, none of them are likable unless you are just like one of them. what a terrible directing and acting. the screenplay, my god, is so bad, i just don't want to get into the details... stay away from this deadbeat and don't waste your lifetime in this pathetic movie, see other versions
1	Best movie ever! I love this movie and have for years. I bought the DVD because I think that my video is nearly worn out
1	freaky stuff! i got this movie a while back wheen i was looking for j-horror live action movies and suprisingly, this movie was very freaky. it is horror but the "dumplings" short is the freakist of them all. if you watch this movie youll understand, just dont eat while watching if you have a weak stomach. all in all, i give it 5 stars cause it was one of the wierdest movies from japan ive seen yet
1	Purchase with confidence If you're thinking of buying this collection, chances are that you're most interested in F.W. Murnau's 1927 silent masterpiece Sunrise. (For whatever reasons Fox may have, this is currently the only official way to get hold of the Sunrise DVD.) My review is mainly aimed at those folks, so I'll try to answer the question: Is it worth buying the other three to get Sunrise? Short answer: Definitely! Fox's DVD transfer of Sunrise, which is an upgrade from an earlier Laserdisc release, is superb. No kidding, it's actually comparable to the best current transfers of silent films, like Kino's Metropolis, WB's Chaplins, and Criterion's Passion of Joan of Arc. Considering that any of those titles would cost you about what you'll pay for this whole collection, you've got to figure that you're getting a pretty good deal. Long answer: I actually believe that two of the other three films here are masterpieces in their own right. How Green Was My Valley, which has unjustly been labelled as the film that "stole" Best Picture from Citizen Kane, ranks among John Ford's best efforts; it's a genuinely beautiful, though an admittedly sentimental, film. And it's one of those movies that received a solid restoration a few years ago -- back when AMC actually showed good movies and took a hand in these sorts of projects. All About Eve, of course, needs no introduction. I find it a tad too long, but I agree that it has one of the best scripts ever written and some fantastic performances. It has finally received a full restoration from Fox -- all the speckles are gone (though some of the image's sharpness has gone, too). Gentleman's Agreement, on the other hand, is one of those movies that's easier to admire for its aims than for its entertainment value or aesthetics. It has dated badly, and Fox's lack of restoration work isn't likely to get it rediscovered any time soon. So my opinion is that you get three great films (and one of historical interest) for a very reasonable price. Each title comes with quite a few extras, if that matters to you -- though here again I think Sunrise benefits from the most informative and interesting extras, including a semi-reconstruction of one of Murnau's "lost" films. Highly recommened
0	Great show, terrible dvds I want to first say that I love Thundercats. Along with gi joe and transformers, it ranks as one of the greatest cartoons of the '80s. The reason for my 1 star review has nothing to do with the show, but instead with the dvds. For such a price it really is highway robbery. The episodes look like they were taken from tv. No remastering or enhancement, you can still see white marks and scratches. Also, as mentioned in another review, the background music is missing from some episodes. Along with that, the menus are sorely lacking. They're very short and without any imagination or flair. Except for the main menu, all the submenus are just still images from the show. And don't fall for the specials. There is a 25 minute documentary with some of the voice artists and producers, but it felt rushed. Not all of the voice artists were interviewed, and with such a show, I'm sure they have enough material for a full 60 minute documentary. One further complaint, no chapters in the episodes. The entire episode is just one big chapter. At least rhino was able to split the episodes into scenes. I would swallow my pride if this cost 19.99 or thereabouts, but not for this price. The lack of detail and quality just shows all over this release; don't you just hate corporate greed.
0	Not worth the time and money... Overall a bad buy! Horrible DVD mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that don't work. The movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it, but nothing really "finished." The extended scenes aren't scored, which is really distracting because I couldn't stop thinking about the great "Mondo Bongo" song that should have been there during the alternate ending, et al! Don't bother with this one... check out the Directors Cuts of "Kingdom of Heaven" (amazing!) and "King Arthur" - they're both very worthwhile
1	enjoyable but a bit disappointing Martin Scorsese is unquestionably one of the grand masters of american film and no one deserves to have an oscar sitting on their desk more than he. But, of course, Scorsese really should have won for Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas, and the multiple wins for this film seem rather clearly to be belated recognition by the industry for total career achievement. This is a decent, entertaining picture, but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best, I think, or one of the best pictures of recent years. The acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast: it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts. Damon is surprisingly good, capitalizing well on his inherent charming slickness, and Walhberg stands out, though he is on screen too rarely. DiCaprio does a nice job, except that I think sometimes the pressure to have him play "vulnerable" and soul-searching ran counter to the moments of the narrative: that no one believes him to be the cop, given the visibly conflicted nervous way he reacts to pressure or violence, is a bit preposterous. The basic storyline, which is almost exactly the same, scene for scene, as in Infernal Affairs, is a pretty neat one, with a lot of nice reversals and twists, though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie. But, somehow, for me, this film just ultimately didn't really all come together despite all the positive elements put into it. Perhaps because I had seen the original version of this tale, the specific changes and updates made to it in Monahan's script to make things "Scorsesian" seemed to stand out too much and come off as weirdly mannered and formulaic. In the end, I had this peculiar feeling like I had just seen almost an imitation Scorsese crime film put together by someone else out of scenes or moments or stylistic flavors from his previous ones, pasted onto the Infernal Affairs framework. It may be that, after the mixed reception and financial disappointments of his most recent, more personal projects, a calculated decision was made to return to safer ground, to gangland loyalties in a heavily ethnic urban environment, and thus maybe even Scorsese's heart wasn't totally into this project; while certainly there's an energy here, the technical work doesn't seem quite as inspired or careful as some of his other work. It may also be that, after living with the Sopranos for years and all the Scorsese wanna-be mob pictures, that I am as a viewer a bit burned out on some of the specific dynamics of the genre, that some of the things that originally seemed fresh and surprising are now after all these years finally turning into cliches for me. So, certainly recommended for viewing, but the Departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done
0	Not as Pleasant as Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled. I really wanted to like this movie because I think the Duff sisters are cute and actually have some potential. This movie has nothing about it to offer additional points to that train of thought. Hilary and Hayley are two spoiled brats who lose all their money, then get it back--an obvious parody of the ditzola factor the Hilton sisters live for real. About as painful, stupid and empty as My Date with the President's Daughter (UGH!), the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is Anjelica Houston. For good teen flicks that are thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend 10 Things I Hate About You and the old 80s classic hit, John Hughes' Sixteen Candles. Where this movie is concerned, I wouldn't recommend it to your dog's fleas.
1	Great Memories I loved this show when it was on TV originally. It's so nice to see it again. Eventually I'll have to get the other seasons on DVD
1	The perfect movie that makes guns useless. This movie has the realistic arts of violence with knives (not guns). LT bonham (tommy lee jones) who is a military instructor who trained Aaron hallam (benicio del toro) very well to become a killing machine. after the war experience aaron goes through in kosovo aaron cannot seem to turn off his deadly technique skills of killing. Now aaron gets out of control the cops can't stop him & opening fire at him won't help at all it just ends up with more casualties of cops and the only one who can stop him is LT which becomes a deadly cat mouse game and a gruesom battle between a teacher and a student which was a really good fight. This movie deserves 5/5 stars for good actors and A good storyline too.
0	Throw Your Metaphorical Tomatoes I'd be hard pressed to find one funny skit--no, one funny moment at all--in this DVD set. Mencia's drivel pretty much reminds me of a lot of David Letterman's "Top Ten" lists; anyone above the age of thirteen could have thought any of this up. It's actually mind numbing how bad some of these jokes are. I'm not bashing--I'm warning. Comedy Central is advertising this as sort of a replacement for the (much) superior Chapelle's Show. Viewer, do not be fooled. Carlos Mencia is the most boring man on television. But I'll give him this; if he came out with this material in the early 1990s, it may have passed. But, like "Mama Jokes", this humor has long dried up. 0/1
1	Amazing collection....all bonus features intact!!! This is a wonderful collection.....normally in box sets you get a lot of fluff with a classic or two if your lucky....well this set offers up pretty much nothing but classics. Harvey is of course a legendary film and performance by Stewart and the bonus features on this DVD being the introduction by Stewart himself is wonderful. The two Westerns are interesting because Destry Rides Again is a very very early film for Mr Stewart and something of a minor classic while Winchester '73 is a major movie which many feel brought back the Western in the early 50's and also ignited a decade plus reign of Mr Stewart as a major star of Westerns as well as working with this same director Anthony Mann on many occaisions. This version of Winchester '73 ..while showing some age on the negative is pretty high quality but the BONUS audio track which runs the feature length with Mr Stewart is priceless. So ...what's left? Ony two of Alfred Hitchcocks greatet films...Vertigo and Rear Window.....the remastered versions which look great and feature wonderful bonus materials on the makings of the films and restorations of them.... I don't want to waste your time with plot lines etc...for all 5 films....but want to congratulate Universal for giving us "all killer , no filler" on this James Stewart "collection" ....a great value and a wonderful look at some of the most important work by this Hollywood Legend
1	More than amazing fight choreography This film is a martial arts film, but not a typical one. It does have stunning fight scenes (the opening will leave you breathless), that are fast paced and well thought out. However it isn't all fight scenes, there is a lot of character development with the protaganist (Jet Li). You see him as a child, and this shows how Huo Yuan Jia's adult personality and obsession with victory in martial arts are formed. He will go through an incredible transformation before the film's end and discover the true purpose of martial arts. The story is very effective, and has a good deal of touching moments. Jet Li fits the role well, and like "Hero" it shows what a big difference getting to do a part in your mother tongue is. His facial expressions alone tell a lot about the character. Target audience: Anyone in their teens and above who don't mind subtitles and enjoy excellent fight choreograpy
1	History with Humor Two of my grown daughters love this musical (hence the reason for my purchasing a second copy). The one loves it for the music and the wit, the other for the presentation of historical information. I've always enjoyed the music and the costume. My only caveat is the historical anachronism of profanity in the mouths of pious men.
1	Forbidden Hollywood This DVD is fascinating! We are history fans and this very enlightening DVD is loaded with facts and cuts of movies that you won't believe
1	Great Collection and Price... This is a wonderful selection of the Martin and Lewis Colgate Comedy Hours. The show used revolving hosts, and Eddie Cantor and Martin and Lewis were by far the most popular. For those that are only familiar with the team through their films, this collection will be a revelation. The duo's television appearances are only a slightly toned down version of their live act-and that was legendary. The show dates are not indicated on the packaging, so here they are: 1-2/4/51, 2-1/25/53, 3-11/4/51, 4-4/29/51, 5-12/19/54 (next to last appearance), 6-11/13/55 (last appearance and the next-to-last episode of the show), 7-No date can be found, but it is the 8th Anniversary of the team on the Comedy Hour, broadcast from Atlantic City. The set also includes trailers for some of their films-great stuff, especially for the films filmed in VistaVision, where the process is promoted as much as the team.

0	Former Martial Arts Sensei Geting Lazy The Great One (who is also a producer here) takes up one of his worst films, namely sleep-inducing `The Foreigner,' and he does the same role that nobody seems to remember. One good news is that the sequel turns out more decent than the original, but that isn't saying much. In `Black Dawn' Steven Seagal plays Jonathan Cold again, who is at first seen helping the brother of one bad arms dealer break out of jail, apparently working for the bad guys. Well, perhaps he should have, for in that case things might have been more interesting than this dull B action film. Besides the obvious stunt doubles, the inept editing, and the chubby face of the star who seems to prefer to stay out of the `action scenes,' you will see CIA agent played by Tamara Davies, also former protégé of Cold. There is one so-so action involving a runaway garbage truck and some OK shoot-outs, but their terrible acting which occupies most of the second half of the film makes everything dull in the end. The idea of Chechen terrorists or nuke attack are reduced to nothing because of the hulk of the star who seems not to care. What you see `in Black Dawn' is your former aikido sensei getting lazy in his work. That's a sad thing to see
0	Painful to watch I thought when I saw Steven Seagal in the movie, "how could you go wrong getting this?" After seeing just 30 minutes of it, I knew how wrong it could go. This is at best a B movie
0	Whip, Gun and Typewriter Having read all these reviews presently on line, it was not hard to find a fair number with which I can agree that this is an abysmal film, even despite the surprisingly impressive physical production values, in the attention to detail that was taken to recreate the physical appearance of the death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Too bad a director with a script telling the truth about the place wasn't there on the set with film and crew to take advantage of it. Many an astutely observed fault has come to be mentioned in a good number of these reviews, as per the really tacky concept of the screenplay itself, the almost adolescent quality to the writer/director's touch; the lack of content in dialogue, the resulting shallowness of characterization for the actors' roles. All of that was well observed, and yet what amounts to the worst fault of all remains without mention, the one thing I had hoped to find which would have obviated any necessity of adding one more, regrettably lengthy review to a long list of them. Okay, so, am I the only one among the whole lot of us here who comes into it sickened by the violent vandalism that has been wreaked upon the historical record of the actual event by this writer/director? Artistic license is one thing but willful distortion of the public knowledge to a purpose of questionable motivation is quite another. If a viewer of this film is familiar with only so much as what can be learned about the revolt of October 7, 1944 from the official website of the Auschwitz Museum at Auschwitz (see the article "Resistance Movement at KL Auschwitz-Berkenau", a pdf file), then one fundamental fact will be known: that the only non-Jewish Poles who were in any way associated with the sonderkommando, were there exclusively in the capacity of kapos, not as crematorium workers; they were the head-bashing S.S. appointed guards (often imported from Polish prisons) whose duties consisted strictly in serving as foreman and cop, to keep the death machine running smoothly and well greased on the blood of Jewish worker and Jewish victim, alike. Well might one inquire into exactly what is being served by Tim Blake Nelson's intent of assigning every sympathetic role in his script to either a Gentile Pole or the Nazi SS--Oberscharfuhrer (Keitel) who has to stay drunk to do what the Jews are doing comparatively sober? So you have these purely mythical Gentile Polish workers of the sonderkommando who are by far, moral superiors to the Jews (typified by the Buscemi character) who soon reveal themselves to be everything that the Keitel character in his Jew-hatred, only lately gained, has to say of them. And what had this SS-Oberscharfuhrer Eric Muhsfeldt to say, but such things as would be based on strict observation, since having seen now how low a Jew can really go, doing to their fellow Jews, what they would so totally not want done unto them. Yet what the Harvey Keitel character doesn't observe, and what Tim Blake Allen's script does not observe is that these Jews under his whip and gun (and/or typewriter) are doing only the same as this Oberscharfuhrer is doing under nowhere near the force of coercion; not to the Jews alone, but as the SS enforcement arm of the Gestapo, to any decent or dissident German, to the whole world, as a cog in the wheel of the greater Reich's death machine. And so the Keitel character fancies himself to be shocked to learn that Jews, just like any German such as himself, can knuckle under and bow, tremble in fear under the marching boots of tyranny, to the surrender of every shred of human decency for sake of howling "Sieg Heil!" safely going with the flow of society; how shocked he pretends himself to be to discover that Jews are no better than he, that given the worst of circumstances, they like he should become killers, money-grubbing wheeler-dealers showing themselves to be by turns, brutal or calculating murderers--traitors to their own kind. But this is not, alas, what is to be gleaned from the script of Tim Blake Nelson's filthy little movie. Quite to the contrary, if a person is not aware of what actually did occur, historically, as from a book like Filip Muller's "Eyewitness Auschwitz: Three Years in the Gas Chambers", then you well might wind up pinning five Amazon stars on the guy with the thought well implanted, most subliminally, in mind that SS-Oberscharfuhrer Eric Muhsfeldt didn't really have it all so wrong, after all. It's not hard to be tricked. See the fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters of Mozart, Goethe and Schiller, circa 1933.
0	The Most Hate-Inducing, Racist Film Ever! A French saying goes: "The more things change, the more they stay the same." It appears that the "historical" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth. One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth. Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina. Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to "purify" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is "preserve the Aryan race." Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well. Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor. Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie. Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content? This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single "good" thing about this movie would have been "discovered/invented" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after. Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time. The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame. They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here. His father was considered a "hero" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel. I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist. This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again. In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view? Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message? Like I said before none of the "techniques" that this film claims to have "discovered" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway. So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess
1	Brilliant cast --- with one exception This was a brilliant show on stage ( I saw the London cast performance ) and the DVD reflects the outstanding performances of this case in these unforgettable and inimitable dances. There is one exceptuion, who for me very nearly ruins the whole show --- Ben Vereen. The show seems to have been engineered to enable him to show off, and his limited dancing and singing skills, combined with monumentally smug demeanour, reduces the efectiveness of the stellar cast. The stage show I saw was so much better for not having him in it. He is one of these talents who seem unacoutnably sucessful and popular in the USA, and for many of us in the rest of the work, his charms are invisible.
0	Absolutely waste of money!! I bought this DVD a while back from Amazon. I was very disappointed with the dvd. It's a joke!,really. He was worse than the beginner dancer. I watched the DVD for about 5 minutes and it made me sick thinking that I paid for this?. I will not accept this if someone give it to me for FREE. If you're serious in learning salsa, the New York Salsa DVD series are very good. Don't waste your money on this one!
1	Wonderful production of Wilde's best loved comedy This 1952 version of the Oscar Wilde classic romantic is as good to watch today as it ever was. Michael Redgrave stars as Ernest Worthing, (whose name, in fact, is really John), a man who, as a baby, had been found in a bag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station. The story is a comedy of errors and confusions around names, in particular the name Ernest. Mr Worthing wants to marry Gwendoline, daughter of the formidable Lady Bracknell. He dare not tell his beloved that his name is not really Ernest as she has expressed a desire only to wed a man of that name. Gwendoline's cousin, Algernon, is pursuing Mr Worthing's ward, Cecily, but she does not know his real name, she believes he is called Ernest. The comedy starts when Cecily and Gwendoline meet for the first time and realise they are both betrothed to `Ernest Worthington'. The film stars Margaret Rutherford as Miss Prism and Dame Edith Evans as the snobbish Lady Bracknell. Both actresses play their roles extremely well, as you would expect from such grand dames of the stage. There are a few extras on this DVD (region 2 version) which include a profile of `The Importance of Being Earnest', a `behind the scenes' gallery, a theatrical trailer and biographies of the main actors and the director. The picture is crystal clear and the colours bright. Sound quality is good and there are subtitles for the hard of hearing. All in all, a very good version of one of Wilde's best known and loved works.
0	Lack of blonde ambition! I only gave this movie 2 stars because of its 2 stars: Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield. Without the presence of these 2 bombshells, the film is a complete bomb. As a piece of film history, it has its place. As entertainment, it's atrocious, even for the time. Still, as I've said, it does have Mamie & Jayne! The male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non-existent, although you can say that about a lot of modern films too. Only get this film if you're passionate about its 2 lusty blonde actresses. Otherwise, get a life
0	Dull Graveyard Charles Band invites you into his Dull Graveyard... This movie starts with a little girl playing with a bunch of dolls. She mistakenly bumps into a table and breaks a vase. Her father comes downstairs and decides to punish her by forcing her to bury her little buddies in a grave outside. She somehow trips and falls into the grave, killing herself. Dad buries the daughter with her beloved toys. Flash forward to thirty years later, a new family has moved into the house. The youngest son is a nerdy geek who likes to collect action figures. Imagine his joy at discovering a whole gaggle of antique dolls buried in his back yard! These dolls come to life and start protecting their new owner by killing everyone that ever picked on him. There are no spoilers here, I'm not giving away anything that isn't on the back of the DVD case. Charles Band returns to what he knows best, making evil puppet horror movies. But just because this is what he knows best, doesn't mean he's any good at it. This is really just a reboot of Puppet Master and Demonic Toys with a new set of evil dolls. The production is shoddy, shot on a cheap DV camera with horrible lighting and a soundtrack that someone did on a Casio keyboard from 1982. Not to mention the fact that the puppets are the best actors in the movie. Ever since Charles Band came out of retirement or hiding, the Blockbuster shelves have been graced with horrible Full Moon movies that are a few pegs below what they used to be. Even in his prime, Charles Band was nobody's genius, but time has definitely taken its toll. Titles like DECADENT EVIL, DOLL GRAVEYARD and THE GINGERDEAD MAN prove that you can't keep a hack director down. Band is back, folks.
1	Chaplin dvd was great! I have always loved this movie and now I can watch it anytime
0	This Waiting Waiting Waiting is Tough At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way. While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-"Unforgiven." A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat. Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of "Rear Window." As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2
0	*yawn* *waaaah* I figured I would check this out, just for kicks, and I guess that the most important thing that I can say about it is that it was a waste of my precious time and I will never get it back :*( I only wish there was a "zero stars" option. But guess what? No matter how much I might disagree with Mr. Fleeger's views ("oh, and you know I do!"), I RESPECT his right to use his second Amendment rights! I would never suggest anyone throw away, burn or otherwise destroy this product because I find what he has to say wrong, which I guess is the difference between liberals like myelf and so-called "conservatives" this product showcases getting angry because the chicks dared express their opinions. I guess that it shouldn't be surprising that those who very likely couldn't explain what the second amendment is about to understand how important it is for people (such as the chicks!) to use them.
0	Trouble staying awake Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake.
1	WC Fields We enjoy all WC comedies. The packaging and the quality are amazing. We laughed often and the "you're Telling Me" was especially funny
1	stick with it Losey's "The Servant" is a film you really have to stick with in order to get to the meat and potatoes. It's almost like two movies in one. It opens up innocently enough, with Dirk Bogarde (Hugo) coming to playboy Tony's (James Fox in a performance that oscillates between being mind numbingly annoying to heart rendingly pitiable) house, offering to be his servant. From there it will take the viewer awhile to understand just how sinister and depraved Bogarde's Hugo is--for a good part of the film he just seems to be a confused, buffoonish servant trying to do his job. From there things get really, really sick. Co-dependency, class struggle, loneliness, alcoholism and finally madness dominate the house as Bogarde accomplishes a slick mastery of Tony's psyche and then his life. He gets the weak minded and wealthy playboy to cheat on his fiancee, and then takes advantage of the ruins his life is left in afterward. By the end of the film you know everything is screwed in a royal (no pun intended) way. Sickness and betrayal crawl from every frame of the last half an hour, and the transformation the film undergoes is unbelievably well done. You really don't know who to sympathize with, since the only character with a single intent and purpose is Tony's fiancee who quickly flees when the situation essentially becomes an orgy of broken minds and hearts. This as good and creepily understated a film as Alfred Hitchcock ever made. A must see.
1	who's the master, who's the servant? Dirk Bogarde is great in this role!! Role reversal,(or was it role rectification?
0	Bad While a good dvd by itself, its intentions are very bad. Most of the footage was stolen from several people who were planning to release it on a different dvd
1	This mob film has it all Christopher Walken is a former organized crime figure that gets kidnapped by a group of preppies that hold him for ransom. (This happens right up front in the story so I'm not giving anything away). The kidnappers realistically come off as bungling amateurs. Walken's presence is overwhelming (even duct taped to a chair) and he looms large over the whole story. Great perfomance. Throughout the film, the viewer keeps anticipating, "Somebody is going to really get hurt here". They do, of course. The story has plenty of mystery and multiple twists. There are gruesome execution and mutilation scenes. It has laugh out loud comedy - special mention to Denis Leary and his "stingray boots". He plays a thug and is appropriately menacing and crude, but he is genuinely funny . . . even while brutally beating a man with a golf club. The R rating is appropriate. A well written and directed film. Camera work a little unimaginative. Good sound. If you are OK with the violence, you are guaranteed an entertaining experience with this film.
0	Blue Christmas I'm a sucker for anything Christmas. I generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year, but come Christmas-time, I lap up these sappy movies. But even I couldn't stomach this one. The screenplay and the acting were so pathetic that the entire time I was watching it I wondered if this was made as a result of a bet that a Christmas movie could be written and shot in 3 days that suckers like me would buy. What a waste of money & time
1	A Ton Of Fun For Film Buffs Since "The Fugitive" is one of my all-time favorites, this takeoff on it was a lot of fun for me to watch. Hey, sometimes it's best to laugh at ourselves and the things we like. For much of it, this movie was laugh-out-loud funny. It helped not only to know "The Fugitive" story well but also "North By Northwest," "Casablanca" "Titantic," "Star Wars" and many, many other films, both classic and modern-day. The more familiar you are with movies, the more of these "inside" jokes are going to make you laugh. Being a movie buff, a lot of these gags connected and made me really have a good time watching this Leslie Nielsen farce. Be warned, parents: this is not a family comedy. There are tons of sexual innuendos, so typical of today's comedies....but overall, this is really funny stuff and highly recommended if you watched a lot films in your lifetime
1	Wonderful, Vintage Christmas Memories What a find! It's sad to think that this special was almost lost, but now it's here in COLOR. For those of you who grew up in the 1950's, it's a wonderful trip down memory lane to a simpler time. I do agree that Frank seems a little more tired than Bing, but both light up the screen with there take on some traditional Christmas carols. I give this 4 stars because, as it is so blatantly mentioned in the extras, the restoration job done on this film is horrible! But, I am at least thankful it exists and that we have the chance to enjoy it, even if it is not sparkling clear. *Note* Careful observers will notice that a new copyright date has been digitally edited into the closing credits "MMI"
0	Tape was of poor quality Like the title states, the tape was of poor quality and skipped alot, making viewing difficult, and it is to much of a pain and just as costly to ship back.I do not recommend buying from this media distributer
1	Humor at it finest Mike Myers is so silly, when you are in need of a laugh, Austin Powers is it. A good laugh is what the world is lacking today.
1	A Beautiful Glimpse This Dvd is a beautiful glimpse into the world, and work, of John Santerineross, known as the leader in this genre, of art photography, he treats us to all the photographs in both of his books, "Fruit of The Secret God", and "Dream", he includes a montage of film clips taken while he composes his pieces, and a short art film about a shocking subject(cutting), done very tenderly, so as not to shock. This little film, in spite of breath taking visuals, is not so much eye candy, as it is mind candy, leaving a hauntingly, bittersweet, after taste on the tongue. The images are living assembelages of religio-sensual elements, presented through a dream like filter. The sepia tone photography, evokes the feeling of, a memory,a strange familiarity, regarding our desires and fears. His work is a wild roller coaster ride, which, thrills, and at times, terrifies, and leaves you wanting to "go again". The images of women portrayed in this work, are a refreshing respite from the mainstream images of women that, we are bombarded with daily in the media. Like REAL women, each image begs to be studied for content. The film itself is not long but is filled with so much information, so much to process, it is an epic in its own right. I highly recommend any of John Santerineross's work, to lovers of neo- symbolist, art, photography, and erotica. To other artists like myself he is truly an inspiration.
1	Required reading for anyone in the Internet biz This film is a true classic - it captures a time, place, and mood with remarkable clarity, but moreover, it predicted the future with amazing prescience. Everyone involved in the communications revolution should know about "TPC" and "Arlington Hewes".
1	Comedy For Paranoids "The President's Analyst" is a pleasant surprise. It's a consistently amusing cold-war comedy that lightly tweaks at everyone's most paranoid fears about espionage, government beauracracy, and monopolistic public utilities among other things. Being the sixties, it also sends up suburban liberals, hippies, and yes, psycho-therapy. James Coburn is brilliant as the analyst who finds that taking on the job as the President's analyst makes him the target of competing interests, some benevolent and some not so. The movie really takes hold when his paranoia starts to set in. Good supporting cast that includes Godfrey Cambridge as a U.S. spy and Severn Darden as an affable Soviet spy. My favorite bit has to involve William Daniels as the gun-toting self-proclaimed suburban liberal
1	My Kids Love It My 2 & 3 year old love this movie. They love to dance to the music. Garfield is so entertaining. This was a great buy.
0	French garbage This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me! Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting. But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never! Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!
0	Off the Formula But Still Disappointing The Rebel-With-A-Heart-of-Gold-Who-Learns-The-Meaning-Of-Love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures, which were very popular in the movies and on TV at that time. The &quot;European&quot; setting got Elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction were basic, to say the least, and the music was uninspired and badly mixed on record. The movie does have one of Presley's best set of opening productiom numbers: &quot;Long Legged Girl..&quot; and others are rousing tunes delivered with that Presley panache often missing from his late-'60s efforts. But about 20 minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan reaches for a magazine. An interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a true &quot;discovery&quot; - an English teenager making her screen debut with Elvis Presley! She handles the light-hearted assignment very well indeed - even the &quot;Old MacDonald&quot; sequence which usually is reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack album cut
0	One of Elvis' worst movies I've seen all of Elvis' movies, most several times. This is one of the worst. Only Stay Away Joe and Harem Scarem are worse. I usually watch every Elvis movie every time it comes on TV, but not these three
0	Not for everyone If your main objective, is the study of human relationships, social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing other people, this movie is for you. Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just, a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script with people, relationships, seduction, etc. This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true. Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others
0	Poor Sound & Episodes from Complete Season1 I thought that perhaps I was losing my hearing. I looked (in vain) for subtitles to see if that would help. My partner assured me that no, my hearing was fine, the audio on these DVD's is woeful. Then I started to have episodes of deja vu. Or maybe jkust episodes that were on The Complete Season One were included in this. Huh? Very strange. I won't buy again until they do something about the audio. It is headache enducing
1	Yes, I Remember When...... I am not familiar with Alan Jackson as I am not a country music afficianado but that does not mean I dislike country music. I think country music is wholesome, down to earth and I can relate to it very much. Not many songs on this DVD but the price is low so not much more can be expected. In my opinion "Remember When" is worth twice the price of the DVD itself. After you watch it you might cry (as I did) or kiss your wife or hug your kids. Beautiful, meaningful. You will not regret purchasing this DVD
1	My most watched film of all time!!! Having been lucky enough to have seen and videotaped the original broadcast of Ric Burn's "Coney Island" way back in 1991 I found myself becoming more and more obsessed with this brilliant documentary. At the time I worked nights and would get home around 3 or 4 a.m. every night - most nights I would pop in my tape of "Coney Island" - I lived and breathed this film. It is everything the above review says it is and more. Anyone with a interest in history, immigration, carnivals, amusement parks, nostalgia, film and photography should definatley purchase this film. You will not regret it. Other titles from the amazing Ric Burns include " The Way West", " The Donner Party" " New York" as well as the epic "The Civil War" which he did with his brother Ken. As far as "Coney Island" goes you'd be nuts to pass this one up.
1	My favorite of the bunch Many fans of the orignal Chainsaw Massacre would have me hanged for saying this, but The Beginning is my favorite of the entire lot. It's a great prequel! The movie is completely brutal and disgusting and even funny in some twisted ways. Leatherface looks totally awesome and the family is even crazier than ever. If you liked the TCM remake a few years ago, you'll love this new one.
1	Tales from Echo Park At the end of my review of Director/Writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's first nationally distributed film, I wondered aloud as to what these talented, quirky guys would do after the fun, I only steal from the very best movies take on the Gay Porn Industry and the hangers-on that populate it,"The Fluffer." Well now I know: it's the very human, thoughtful and real "Quinceanera." Shot in a section of Los Angeles just 10 minutes from where I live yet on many levels worlds apart socially and ethnically, and reeling and rocking from the mixture of Mexican-Americans, who have lived there for many years and the Upscale Interlopers in the form of Non/Mexican Americans who go to Echo Park looking for homes that they can afford now that the Westside of Los Angeles is way beyond most peoples means. Glazer/Westmoreland's take on this Cultural and Monetary disparity is to step back, aim the camera and refuse to take sides: both the Inhabitants and the Interlopers are examined carefully and without judgment. The central story involves the impending Quinceanera (a sort of Bat Mitzvah) of Magdalena (a strong, fiery Emily Rios), her "miracle" pregnancy and Carlos (an angry, intelligent Jesse Garcia) who happens to be Gay which does not sit well with his father who promptly ejects Carlos from his home: both Mag and Carlos find acceptance and Love with their Great Uncle Tomas...the emotional center of his family and of this film, Chalo Gonzalez. "Quinceanera" is not a perfect film: the flaccid editing hurts the last third of the film but despite this, few film scenes have as much emotional power and pack such a wallop as Carlos's ( and therefore, of course, Jesse Garcia's) eulogy at Tomas' grave-site, in front of a family that mostly despises him because he is Gay: it is on the one hand brave and on the other as heartbreaking and emotionally open and naked a scene as any committed to film in a long, long time.
0	Confusing, slow, and sub par acting Jesus, I'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie. The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short. But besides her I the story was windy and contrived, too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to. Mia Kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me.
1	timeless I had seen Kraftwerk live in Ohio at the Agora when they came out with Computer World many years ago. I've been waiting for another chance at seeing them "live" and this is it! It's been worth the wait! This is muzik to get lost in, just close your eyes, lean back, and enjoy. :
0	Snoozalinga I watched this dogg-o with some Japanese folks I know and let me tell ya all of thought it was the most boring, obvious, dated bore we'd laid eyes on in many a moon. And these guys are from a very wealthy, aristocratic, old Japanese family at the vanguard of Westernization in the 50s. STAY AWA
1	A Stirring WWII Film! Dana Andrews is excellent as the Captain of a downed Army Air Corps B25 bomber over Japan. These US Flyers are captured and put on trial in a civilian court in front of the international press for suppossed &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. The Japanese secretly torture the Airmen one by one trying to discover if they came from a land base or a carrier. The story basically revolves around whether or not the American Airmen will tell the Japanese what they want to know. The final minutes of the film are quite stirring. The film music master, Alfred Newman did the score for the film and cleverly chose not to use very much underscoring music until the final scene in the film. Although the music he uses is borrowed and not original his adaptation of it is powerful
1	Good short Power Yoga routine for building strength First a few words about myself so you can more easily judge if my opinion might be helpful to you or not. I teach Power Vinyasa Yoga at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club. I train every day and prefer complete Power Yoga Flow Routines that challange your overall bodystrength a lot and still contribute to every aspect of Yoga (meaning the meditative aspects, proper breathing, inner awareness and so on). Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that! About the DVD: The routine is about 25 Minutes long but still offers you quite a challange for the short time. I can't do 60 to 90 Minutes of Yoga every day, so I'm glad to own a couple of shorter programms for the days in between or for early in the morning. Rodney Yee is a hihgly skilled Instructor with a very gentil and calm manner and an interesting style of Yoga. His voice is always soothing, but still encouraging. The programm on the DVD is specially challanging for upper body strength but still working the whole body. It's fluid and, regarding the short time, complete. The only one little thing I can critizise is that the verbal instruction is somtimes not absolutly in line with the instruction on screen. From time to time Rodny on screen is movin just a little to fast compared to his verbal instruction. But that's not very important and doesn't cause any problems, so I can still rate this 5 Stars. If your looking for a short physicaly demanding Power Yoga routine, this is for you. It's not suitable for absolute Beginners since Rodny moves pretty fast from Pose to Pose and some are to challanging for an absolute beginner. I would recommend it for intermediate to advanced students. If your interested in more Power Yoga, check out my other reviews about Power Vinyasa Yoga DVDs. To see al DVDs I recommend check out my listmania list. Let my know if you found the reviews helpfull. I truely hope so! Namast
0	I love to dance I'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter --she loves this DVD- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star-- I love watching her enjoy this dvd!!
0	Not even worth illegally downloading!!! Holy moley. This thing sucked rancid twinkies through a hot garden hose. Even *if* you could get past the editing, there's the lighting. Even *if* you could get past the lighting, there's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video (even in the first scene, when the flute player didn't even come close to keying with the notes...and on and on and on). Even *if* you got past the editing, lighting, and sync problems, you're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage. No matter HOW good you think he is (and I do agree he's quite talented) it's obvious that Flatley thinks he's even better. At the expense of the story, the cohesion, and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment, he's out to show how awesome he is. Which tells me that other than dancing, he doesn't have a lot going for him. He kind of reminds me of Mighty Mouse... chest puffed out... "Here I come to save the dayyyyyy!!!" I'll tell you what to save... save your money, put it as the very very last item on your internet dvd rental queue, and hope you never get to it
0	Bottom of the Barrel 'Nightmare City' aka 'City of the Walking Dead' aka 'Invasion of the Atomic Zombies' (by far the best title) is pretty much the most reviled film of the European zombie cycle of the early 80's. I don't think this is entirely fair. Personally, I think this movie is better than Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead'. But, that ain't much of a prize, and this film is pretty damn lousy. But, it's still worth seeing if you're a zombie fan. So, as I always say, if you've even heard of this movie, you'll probably think seeing it is worth your time. In some ways this film is slightly better than average. The scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent, perhaps slightly better than what you'd usually get in this sorta film. None of the characters are remotely interesting, but the acting is not atrocious, if not good either, and the dialogue is rarely laughable. (Except for Anna's ridiculous, luddite social commentary. And that's funny due to the content, rather than the delivery.) The problem with this film is the zombies themselves. Now, I'm not a total zombie purist, but I can't call this a real zombie film. I don't care that they run, and I don't care that they aren't dead (or maybe they are. I forget. Don't care either way.) The problem is that they always use weapons and tools. Now, it's one thing to use these items sporadically, but they do it all the damn time. For the most part, these supposed zombies just run up and stab people. Not very zombie like. Furthermore, they just aren't animalistic enough. The fast zombies in '28 Days Later' and the new 'Dawn of the Dead' were at least wild and out of control. These ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads. What it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame. They look terrible, with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads, at best, or just some black goo. Lame behavior and lame appearence= LAME. I think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could've been a middle of the road zombie pic, and if they had some decent gore. The gore in this is terrible, other than a few amusing exploding heads. It's not especially gory for this sort of film either, though again, this isn't much of a loss considering the quality of it. There's not too much else to say, it's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up. Reasonably amusing, but not much more than that. The only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation, and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks. That was pretty sweet. Yeah, that's it. Amusing, but just barely. Grade: D
0	Yawn My main dispute with this Cinderella romance between young sisters and the conveniently available rich bachelor's from far away America -- it's rated R. Why did the director feel it necessary to tell what is essentially a chocolate-chomping girl's heartbreak with nudity and graphic groping? Teens love their romance, boy-girl breakups, and crush's. This media world of overt-sexuality and easy porn - come on --- let the kids have their childhood. Oh, how many young sis' have coveted their older sister's boyfriends. All of them! And that sexual awakening thing is happening at breakneck speed, but in 60 percent of American girls - the actual event begins with marriage. In this film marriage is not portrayed as something folks do for love: the sisters want to marry up at any cost. Is that a good lesson for teen gals? Perhaps I'm not being fair on the philosophical side, but how about a believable story we can care about? You won't find it in I Capture the Castle. You'll instead discover your first yawn developing about ten minutes into the production as the eccentric wife does her nude scene, the eccentric writer does his prison scene, the girls do their not enough to eat in this romantic castle scene, and suddenly the guys show up like Price Charmings out of nowhere like we haven't seen that one before. I'm sorry. I think I'll take a nap.
0	Not So Good This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags. Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard. Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of "The Incredible Journey," the one they only have on videotape
0	Worst DVD transfer I've ever seen. Are you kidding me? This is nothing more than a VHS to DVD transfer and it looks awful. It's a complete travesty. 'Extreme Prejudice' is one of the most underrated action flicks of the late eighties. A wonderful homage to Peckinpah that deserves better treatment than this piece of garbage. Oh, and the cover art sucks too
1	Eddie Murphy makes it work: animal lovers will love this Set in San Francisco and not England, the American Dr. Dolittle is just as comical as the original British vetrinarian in the 1960's muscial. When Dr. Dolittle's animal telepathic skills resurface he not only is sent to a mental institution but he ends up having to save a circus tiger's life. This California rendition complete with scenic shots of the Bay Area, is a departure from the children's books, but succeeds in its key message: either be yourself or nothing at all even if the mass population thinks you're crazy. Not being true to yourself is the direct route to driving you truly crazy
1	Beautiful pilates video you will do often This pilates video stands out from the rest. The setting is a beautiful beach cove with the background audio of gentle waves, not music. After you heat up with the 100's and rest of the warm-up you almost feel like you are on that beach next to the instructor doing the routines. Other videos are often filmed in a stark unchanging studio and can get boring after a few times. The instructor has a nice smile and pleasing voice, and gives just the right amount of instruction and with the right tempo, making the exercises very easy to follow while always reminding you of your posture and breath. The routines flow easily from pose to pose without unnecessary gaps or breaks. The first part is perfect for beginners, yet I found the second part challenging enough for an early intermediate level. Don't skip the intro, where the instructor does a nice job explaining what pilates is all about and how to intergrate it in your practice. Since this video in enjoyable to do, I find myself practicing with it often. I just returned from a snowboarding trip and felt improvements in my core strengh, balance and flexibility. I recommend it for beginners to early intermediates who want to enhance how they feel and how they perform in sports.
1	Enjoyable... ..it may seem simple..cheap cgi graphics and bad acting and uknown actors..but still the action in the movie is really good, from Africa to Roterdamn or however u spell it.. one notetable scene was the last scene, where Jackie Chan takes on 2 guys at the same time on top of a skyscraper..he kicks both their asses..after that he decides to jump off a steep part of the building...instead of using the elevator,,only JC can pull something off like that..i think this is prolly JC's last great film..in HK..i dint really like his U.S. features..the action in those was weak..and the fighting was jus.. really amtatuer, iguess he had to slow down in the american films..anyhow if u lookn for a good JC movie..go out and buy this one..it can rank with Supercop..Police Story 1 and 2..and project A..real good movie...2 thumbs u
1	Splendid! It seems, as time goes on, Henley just gets better. With the eagles he came up with 'The Last Resort' possibly one of the prettiest use of chord sequences about and powerful words to accompany them. Then solo with classics 'The End Of The Innocence' and 'New York Minute' and now with what I regard the best two tracks on this album 'Goodbye To A River' and 'Damn It Rose'. The latter trying to convey the suicide of a close friend. What you hear is what you get with Henley. He has to be the finest vocalist 'live' I've encountered. As for his songwriting let me put it this way, I'd put him up next to Roger Waters with the way his songs always manage to move me. Shame they left the two best songs form the album off the DVD. Splendid work Mr Henley. Time to take another eleven year break it was worth the wait
0	turn it off if pac was still here now he would never ride with ja nah nah nah nah nah na
1	Romeo Must Live First of all it has Aaliyah in it and for her first movie debut she way over excelled in my opinion. The movie is seious yet it has comedic ways, which I love about it and the actors in it are great at bringing the movie alive, if any of them were to be replaced with someone else it wouldn't have been the same because they all made it their very own. Also the characters in it are very slick and the martial arts is cool, usally I don't care for martial arts movies, when I'm watching this I can't take my eyes of the screen. If you love comedy, martial arts, and romance you should check this movie out. Yet another thing to keep Aaliyah's beautiful legacy alive!!! R.I.P babygirl, fly high with your twenty two doves, you'll always be forever in my heart!!
0	Disappointing Don't waste your time or your money on this film. Trust the detailed negative reviews provided on this site. I can only assume the positive comments were written by someone affiliated with the film to get their "star" rating up. Could have been so good, the result was unfortunate
0	Awesome movie, lame HD DVD The movie is awesome - 5 stars. HD DVD transfer looks grainy (digital noise) and the colors are off and washed out. As crazy as it sounds, it looks worse then I remember it on VHS. Anyway, the standard DVD is better than this on an upconvert DVD player. Really dissapointing....
0	If you find another source... If you find another source for this movie, pursue it! I liked the movie very much, and saw it first produced on Showtime Entertainment. This copy appears to be burn made from someone's TV set. Good movie for cheesy fun films, poor quality recording.

1	very good, for action fans for those who like the martial arts movies and lots of action this is just the movie for you, Jet Li is remarkably skilled and very fast with his skill
0	Meh ... I've been there I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever. But, it failed to impress. I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him. I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much. And my determination paid off! *Patting myself on the back* But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie. The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either. The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise
1	John LeCarre, BBC at Their Best "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"the 1979 British Broadcasting Company's 6-part television serial is, of course, based on the masterful novel, of the same name, by British spymeister John LeCarre. The novel, itself, was the first of LeCarre's Smiley-Karla trilogy, that ends with "Smiley's People."And, as the beneficiary of a first-class production by the BBC, "Tinker" achieves masterpiece status itself. The series, adapted by the talented Arthur Hopcraft for the screen, follows LeCarre's complex novel rather closely, giving us the intriguing plot developments,the well-rounded characters, and the witty dialogue. Furthermore, the BBC hired some of the best available actors for the many principal roles, and surrounded them with all the extras, the cars, and the location shooting any viewer could wish. The plot concerns George Smiley, forcibly retired, along with a number of his good-guy friends, from Britain's spy service, called "the circus" by Le Carre. It is realized that there may be, within the spy service, a mole: a term created by leCarre himself to describe a person recruited in the past, and worked into a sensitive position, before being awakened to start reporting on his surroundings. To, in this case, Smiley's opposite number, the feared Karla, chief of the ruthless Russian spy machine. As it is realized that there is such a person working, and he is responsible for an unthinkably large amount of damage, including the deaths of several spy networks, and the dismissals of Smiley and friends, Smiley is drafted to locate him. But Smiley must work in secret, with only limited help from the official circus. Alec Guiness plays Smiley with an instinctive understanding of the character that has seldom been bettered. He is, as mentioned previously, surrounded by some of the best actors available: Bernard Hepton as Tobe Esterhase, chief of the go-to boys; Ian Richardson as the mysterious Bill Haydon, Ian Bannen as the victimized Jim Prideaux, Alexander Knox as Control. Also Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Smiley's protege; Anthony Bate as Oliver Lacon, seasoned bureaucratic infighter; George Sewell as Inspector Mendel; Terence Rigby, and Michael Aldredge. There's only one casting mis-step; Hywell Bennett as Ricky Tarr, the spy whose unthinking love affair, with a pretty Soviet agent, begins the unraveling of the circus's dark secret. Bennett, who was the pretty-boy flavor of the month back then, simply cannot hold the screen with all these heavyweights. It requires some patience, and full attention, to follow this intelligent series, that sometimes moves too slowly for American tastes, but those efforts are surely rewarded. This series is John LeCarre, and the BBC, at their best. However, you might want to be sure you can watch it on successive nights, rather than as it was originally shown, on a weekly basis: it's a lot easier on the memory that way.
0	sloooooooooooooooow and booooooooorinnnnng john le carre' novels are all crawled forward like snail. reading his novels are just like reading those novels of those written in 19th century. his novels about cold war were like a guy walked in a dream, they have to be tolerated with extreme patience, because the blah, blah, blah sometimes would make you lose focus. this 3-dvd movie is just like his novels, so slow and so boring. i don't believe any reader under 30 years could read along with great enthusiasm, his novels are written for the folks wearing bi-focals sitting on the recliners. i do think if all the spies who were caught and then put in jail during the cold war, there are 3 ways to make them confess and sing like canary: 1) force them to read john le carre's cold war novels to bore themselves to death; 2) force them to watch these 3-dvd movies, smiley's people & tinker, tailor, soldier and spy; 3) force them to listen to the sound track of 'sound of music' 24/7. they'd be either gone crazy or hang themselves in their cells or, talk very soon :)
1	Enthralling "Winged Migration" was shown on PBS not long ago. I set my VCR to tape it. Not having the time to check the length of the program, I had the VCR record it for one hour. As the tape played, I became totally enthralled by the majesty, strength, and beauty of the birds, the gorgeous photography, and perfectly accompanying music. Then the taping cut off. The program had been one and one-half hours. I was missing the last half hour. Far from being disappointed, however, it was a blessing in disguise. For this film is so extraordinary that a mere taping from cable doesn't do it justice and I decided to buy the DVD if available. I searched PBS; they didn't offer it. Next stop: Amazon. Sure enough, they had it, and it arrived two days ago. The DVD is so magical I can't stop watching it. Plus my purchase helps support these wonderful people who created this tribute to the wonderful birds. I have now returned to Amazon to buy *five* more as gifts. I know I will be giving family and friends a wonderful experience when I give them a DVD of "Winged Migration." It is an experience not to be missed
1	Something strange ! This was one of my favorites when I was young and I can't wait to see it again ! Plus it has that cool song in it "Who you gonna call ? Ghostbusters !
1	The film you were not allowed to see! Released my MGM--Metro Goldwyn-Mayer, October 24, 1962. Rainy day: Pleasesee this film from beginning to the very end without any distraction or interruption. This is a very important and wee-made film. On DVD "Main Options", notice the card Frank Sinatra is holding. Showing the back side and changing to Queen of Diamonds. Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) has just returned from Korea. At the airport is a grand fanfare put on by his head-strong mother (Angela Lansbury) whoose husband, John Iselin (James Gregory) is campaigning to be the next President in the White House. Raymond despises his mother, but she has this "control" over him. She also is handling her husband's campaign very closely even giving him cleverly the exact way to answer a question. Meanwhile, Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has a dream that he and his other combat buddies are at a garden tea party meeting hosted by a Chairlady (Helen Kleeb, [The Waltons tv series]). The dream changes to the men sitting at a seminar hosted by Dr. Yen Lo (Khigh Dhiegh). Dr. Lo asks Raymond, while all are brainwashed, to kill Ed (Richard LePore). Major Marco suddenly wakes up screaming from his dream. major Marco decides to investigate if his other soldiers are experiencing the same frightful dream. Also in the cast: Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, James Edwards, Douglas Henderson, John McGiver, Jocelyn Jordan, Lloyd Corrigan, Joe Adams, Bess Flowers, Tom Lowell. Academy Award Nominations: Best Supporting Actress, Angela Lansbury, Best Film Editing. DVD is in full screen on one side, Wide-screen on the other side. Audio Commentary by John Frankenheimer. Special 1988 interview with Frank Sinatra, John Frankenheimer, George Axelrod. Frank Sinatra pulled this film out of further release because of the assassination of our President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, November 22, 1963, as you will understand why after seeing this film all the wat through. Kennedy's accused assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald who was then assassinated by Jack Ruby on his way to trial. Oddly, their are references in this film to President Abraham Lincoln who was assassinated, April 14, 1865. Did Oswald see the film "The Manchurian Candidate"? Frank Sinatra re-released this film in 1987. Frank Sinatra personally chose Lucille Ball for the role of the mother, however the role ultimatly went to Angela Lansbury. One source had the honor of seeing a "special exhibition" print and he swears this special print showed the big Queen of Diamonds costume with red over black. This print is not available on VHS nor DVD. This film was also re-released to pay-per-view television in 1987. Terrible remake: The Manchurian Candidate (2004) with Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber.
0	Long, Boring This was so long and drawn out. It took over 3 hours for this film to lay out what any crime show could have done on TV in an hour, including all the commercials. There were so many scenes that just went ON and ON - that's what they make DVDs for: to cut out long useless scenes to add to the "deleted scenes" special edition, so people who actually liked the movie can watch more of it, haha. acting wasn't even very good and not always very believable. just CHEESY. save yourselves 3 hours of your life. also, i have no idea why one reviewer thought there was no sex. though it really wasn't as violent as most movies, still it's no family movie
1	Watch with your best girlfriend... I took my best friend to see this (second run) in an small, artsy theatre in San Francisco. It was so vivid and colorful... very interesting to watch. I found myself following the storyline without having to focus solely on the subtitles. As a result, I could appreciate the landscapes, the costumes, the hidden innuendos... all the first time around. This movie is definitely for those that can truly appreciate the pure essence and beauty of female friendship. There is a scene near the end when the uppity, seemingly prudish Momoko staunchly defends and protects her rough-around-the-edges biker friend, Ichigo that made us want to cheer. As the end credits rolled, the small audience broke into applause. Afterwards, we raved incessantly about how much we collectively loved it
0	How, why, what, huh? I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something. Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm
1	Toooo beautiful for words A must have. I enjoyed and loved ever minute. It does need widescreen. But that is the only flaw. "...And really Bad eggs, drink up me hearties Yo Ho!!!" This video is just at the end of standard definition and actually surpasses what SD can do. I really need the Hi def disk. I suggest buying both, this is that good. I LOVED every NANOSECOND of it
1	Four stars for originality... ...it is about a Comet that destroys all people who were exposed to it while it was passing through earth. Only a few survivors are left, and some who weren't directly exposed begin to turn into "zombie" like creatures. This is a fun 80's flick, with an original story. A good addition to your movie library
0	Enough with the Lions! I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ..
1	Oh, my, my... It's obvious from reading so many of the reviews of 'Happy Feet', what's wrong with this country. Really, people...get a life! It's a perfect reflection of our political climate, that a certain sector of the population is so wound-up, pent-up, angry, frustrated (and in so many ways), that they take it out on a bunch of harmless cartoon characters. I suppose this indicates that the angry rage over Tele-Tubbies has reached an end. My, this country has become a strange, dark place. All that aside, I loved this movie, and can't think of a legitimate reason not to let your children see it. Smile...it won't break you.
1	Simply Amazing! Christina at Her Best! This Christmas Special is a must have if you're a Christina fan or if you think shes untalented give it a look to see just how talented she really is. Not only does Christina sing her hit songs, "Genie in a Bottle," "What a Girl Wants," and "I Turn To You," she also sings some Christmas classics also on her christmas album, My Kind of Christmas. Christina also sings some songs that aren't on her cds like "Climb Every Mountain," from The Sound of Music, one of Christina's favorite movies. Also included: "Alright Now," and Etta James' "At Last." The Christmas songs she sings are "Merry Christmas Baby," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," and her song "Christmas Time," which is new on her Christmas cd, My Kind of Christmas. Not only does Christina sing in english but she sings two of her Spanish songs "Contigo En La Distanica," and "Falsas Espernazas." Special Guests: Lil Bow Wow, Brian McKnight, and Dr. John Christina nails all of the songs on this dvd, its absolutely amazing, defenitely worth a watch and better then her previous dvd Genie Gets Her Wish
0	not 141 minutes and where the ----- is the music????? A huge disappointment. First, there is only a documentary of 50 something minutes... just talk and talk and snapshots of people and the events... Then, a 10 min montage, more interviews and... where is the music?? Aweful..
1	One of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films... In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped "The Day the Earth Stood Still" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gort--the prototype, Michael Rennie suggests, for a global police force... Similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out of space-ships ever since... In "Devil Girl from Mars," the giant refrigerator robot Chai hunts for virile Scotsmen and find John Laurie, while in 'Target Earth,' the Venusian robots imitate Gort in projecting rays from their heads but take the idea a step further and make the rays lethal... In Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie... But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.' His 'Terminator' is a systematic metal, 'surrounded by living tissue,' an invulnerable cyborg, part man, part machine, with whom 'it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.' The film opens with two naked men appearing in two different parts of Los Angeles' darkened streets... One is tall and powerfully built, the other is compact and muscular... Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor... Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the 'killer cyborg' who 'looks like Death rendered in steel.' He has searched the phone book and brutally shot to death other unfortunate women who bear the same name... He is sent back from the future to present-day (1984) to kill the mother of an unborn enemy... Schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like a panther, scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings, and in a perfect simulation of voice, he is on the track of his victim... He examines his weapons with precise movements, drives expressionlessly, and kills without pity, or remorse, or fear... It is a role that suits his talent perfectly... Michael Biehn seems scared by traumas of others wars... His face outlines a long burn scar... He tries to stop Schwarzenegger's attempts to be carried out... He is sinister in his long coat... His whole life has been combat... He identifies himself as Reese, a soldier from the future, assigned to protect Sarah at all costs... For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend... We feel his pain and anguish when he said: 'That terminator is out there. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!' Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed... She feels a blind panic boiling up within her, a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine... She is in a daze, paralyzed, shivering silently, uncontrollably... Her fragile personality disguises a hidden force she did't know she had... Cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...
1	Watch it for the Fonz and Kathy Bates performances This movie reminded me of a spoof of 'Forrest Gump'. I have no idea if it was intended that or not. I choose to look at it that way because that is the only way that this could ever possibly be funny. However, the real jokes are that Tom Hanks took the same material and impressed critics and audiences with his acting skills while Adam Sandler just amused a few people who watched this film. The other joke in the film is Adam Sandler's voice. He kept changing it. First, he had a mild southern accent, then he just began talking slower and faking a stutter. Regardless, I got a slight chuckle from the idea of him trying to fake a voice to sound stupid. His real voice would have fit all too perfectly
1	My favorite comedy movie of all time This homage to Alfred Hitchcock is a work of genius. The shower scene in this movie remains one of the best parodies ever. Madeline Kahn's role is one of her best and Cloris Leachman looks as if she enjoyed playing her character. The casting in this movie is inspired.
1	Must have for the KC fan! I loved the videos on this DVD although I too could have done without the fan footage. However, if you are a Kenny Chesney fan, I think you definitley would want this for your collection
0	what a joke... this is supposed to be entertainment? well,wait...yeah, it is...comedy! what a joke to think anyone with half a budweiser soaked brain thinks this guy has an ounce of talent...people that like this stuff probably are the same people who like Tim McGraw,Toby Keith and the like...if you ask them &quot;who has more talent, the eagles or Kenny Chesney?&quot; their likely answer would be the latter...what are they putting in that there budweiser lately? must be some kinda mind numbing stuff to make people think this waste of space- poor excuse for a human being and even sorrier excuse for a musician could even stand in the same room with a legend like the Eagles or Fleetwood Mac...it's really sad to see the music industry fall to this low a level...speaking of Fleetwood Mac, has anyone heard the awful rendition of &quot;Landslide&quot; by the Dixie Chicks? sounds like someone scratching the chalkboard to me...check out the original,and judge yourself...if you know what talent is when you hear it..
1	Amazing for Adults and Children What a great lesson in perserverance--kids will be eager to create their own works of art in the backyard. Andy is amazing and this DVD is pure beauty
0	Legends Of The Dull More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff
1	Hilarious, True and Funny Anybody who has ever worked in any service industry should and can appreciate this movie....As a Floor Capitan in an above average resturant I would have sworn they filmed it in my establishment at times....As I watched - I saw so many people that fit the characters in the movie in my own place....As the saying goes on the box - "Never upset anybody who comes in contact with your food!" This goes along with what my own father told me when we first came to the USA. People get off your cell phones and watch this hilarious movie
0	This is an excuciatingly dull, BAD movie As a lover of film noir and proud owner of most that are on DVD or VHS, I can say without hesitation that this is one of the very worst ever. The only reason I gave it two stars, instead of one, was because of the fine performers who were saddled with this inane script. Joe Ferrer's hypnosis of Gene Tierney to allow her to sleep is nothing compared to the yawns brought about by the agonizingly slow pace, lack of action, and interminable pauses between lines. At one point, Gene Tierney swears that she hasn't been lying, and you find yourself wanting to respond: "Of course, you haven't. You haven't said anything of import." The storyline makes absolutely no sense. Jose Ferrer has set up the perfect crime so what does he do? He returns to the scene for no apparent reason other than to be captured. He hypnotizes Gene Tierney to steal incriminating evidence and then has her place the items where they will inexorably be discovered. A complete waste of wonderful performers. Cross this one off the list, and donate the $9.99 to your favorite charity. Or pourchase "The Dark Corner," a truly memorable Fox noir with an outstanding performance by a breathtakingly gorgeous Lucille Ball
1	Star Wars Come on, if you are looking to get this, do it....it is STAR WARS after all!! Everyone either loves it or hates it. no in between, if you like Star Wars then add this to your collection, if you do not like Star Wars, go away - look for something else------you will not fit in here
0	I saw this with a Holocaust survivor We enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor, but my friend, a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and a forced labor camp, was finally outraged by this treatment of the Holocaust, as was I. A child in Auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience! My friend would have been gassed to death, because he later found out they gassed all kids under the age of 18 soon after he left for a labor camp. Watch Divided We Fall instead! Or for a very good depiction of life in the camps, watch Fateless or The Grey Zone
0	Was this movie made for the Lifetime channel? If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. This movie was not scary. It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters. You know what the best part was? When it was over. Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad. This one obviously did
0	These cats just lip sing.... I'm a huge Bone fan and I expected a great DVD and it has many performances but the catch is that THEY LIP SING on all there performances. So when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our CD's we have of them. The only performance that they actually rap in this DVD is the 1996 MTV Awards and you can clearly tell the difference. But to Bone's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap. If it wasn't for that great performance this would've got 1 star. And the backstage seens were short and worthless basically. So even if your a huge Bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned...
1	I'm so excited I literally feel like I'm going to fall over and die. My anticipation is so great that I can hardly contain myself. I'm counting down the days, no, the minutes till it arrives at my doorstep. When it does, I fear that I just may very well keel over with a heart attack and die I won't be able to stand it. I can only hope my poor heart will hold out long enough for me to actually watch the movies. I will be so happy then.
0	Gilmore Girls fans beware! this season gets WAY too soap opera for my family's taste, but maybe thats just us. I just wish they had kept it simpler like it was in the beginning
1	Peter Sellers is once again excellent With every new Pink Panther Movie, Peter Sellers' performance continues to grow and mature. I've seen this move at least 7-8 times so far. It's definitely a classic. Lots of good laughs. My other favorites: Matrix Series (Christian Mysticism & Symbolism) V for Vendetta () Harry Potter Series Underworld (war between the Vampires and Lycan) (Mythology, Symbolism, "Collective Unconsciousness" as per Carl Jung's work) P.S. Peter Sellers as Insp Clouseau is quintessential Virgo
1	Hauntingly Beautiful, a Must-See for those who judge a movie by its screenplay The creators of this film had no ceilings on their vision of what they could bring to life when tackling the process of transforming the depths of the screenplay into the heights of a multidimensional cinematic experience. If you can see this on a big screen, do it. With shades of "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover," Tarsem Singh, the director, has fashioned his genius with his crew's technical refinement. The movie itself is worth owning for the following reasons: Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio on the same screen at the same time, two great actors in two great roles; Jennifer Lopez way outside the box -- JLo only peaks out three times when her accent creeps back in on a few words; the stunning visuals and special effects rival only those of "What Dreams May Come;" this is Tarsem Singh's directorial debut and it displays the mastery of his vocation; and finally, the screenplay itself would have made a fascinating plot line under any direction, but auspiciously came to life under the wing of Tarsem Singh. Warning: Plot Spoilers ahead. Jennifer Lopez is a psychologist who uses breakthrough neurological technology to enter the subconscious mind of a comatose child and then that of a serial killer, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. However, she has never tried "reversing the feed," which involves bringing the other person into her subconscious mind because of the emotional dangers of such a mind merge. The highlight of the entire movie is when, against the will of her superiors, she decides to do this anyway and brings the killer into her own world where he appears as his little boy self. The incredible battle she must wage between bestowing Compassion for the torture he endured from his father in childhood and delivering Justice for the torture he has inflicted on innocent women as an adult comes climactically to fruition in a sequence of tragically requested and tragically rendered Mercy. The terrible beauty of the death of suffering is brilliantly written, acted, directed and produced in a denoument that is priceless and at the very least worth the cost of the DVD. Vincent D'Onofrio is a gift to the screen and Tarsem Singh a gift to both actor and audience. Enjoy this film even more the second time for its exploration of innocence versus experience, mercy versus justice, and life versus death
1	A Hard Lesson The thing that we in our time fail at is to disapprove of someone for the right reasons. The true historical significance of Hitler and the Nazis is not well known. An earlier reviewer ntioned that Germany was in a wretched state economically and morally when the Nazis started to vie for power. This cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that Hitler repaired Germany's economy and in an astonishingly short period of time brought Germany to the forefront of world power. What is not understood is the true threat that Hitler posed. The 25 Points of the National Aryan Socialist Party were a list of goals that they wished to achieve. Number 11 clearly stated that they wished to eliminate interest banking; and felt that it was crippling Europe's economy. Of course they blamed the Jews: but this broad-stroke was clearly one of Hitler's failures. What is significant is that once Hitler declared this; the international banking cartels realized that he was a threat to them. Any nation who seeks economic autonomy cannot be tolerated. In fact, almost all the wars that have been fought in the last two and a half centuries were merely busines deals gone sour. Hitler never wanted war with England. It was in Churchil's interests to instigate war, owing to his being a puppet for the international financial elite. Having said that, there is the quality of the nation-state, and its upliftment wherein Hitler was a pioneer and trailblazer. He was the first to use the technological method to achieve his aims. He wa sthe first human being to appear on a public TV broadcast, he used radio and TV and in this case, cinema, to great effect. The holocaust was distinctive only in that it was the worlds first application of technological method towards genocide (unfortunately, not the last). Watching his speech in this movie was a lesson in the manipulation of public opinion: and in human psychology. There was, within Hitler and his methods, a cynicism concerning the general state of the people. Consider the following quotes: "I reserve reason for the few, and emotion for the many" "If I approached my audiences with reasoned arguments, they wouldn't understand me. Their intelligence is small. I must reduce my philosophies to four or five very simple points which I repeat over and over again, until my words become like commands under hypnosis" This is the general opinion he had of the majority of people. And if you examine any modern politician's speeches, they use the exact same methods of addressing their audiences. Ms. Reinfenstahl's brilliant cinematography upheld this in an eloquent manner. Hitler wrote the book on how to effectively set up and maintain a technological tyranny; and his techniques have proven effective - especially when his obvious mistakes are avoided. He was just too obvious. Too much ego. To little hypocracy. We can't say we weren't warned
1	A convincing vision of Hitler in Hell The great 18th century mystic Swedenborg, who claimed prolonged visions of Heaven and Hell, reported that souls in Hell don't know they're in Hell because they're behaving as they did in life; the angels, however, look upon them and see them as terrible beasts. As I watched this profoundly engrossing film, I had no doubt by its end that it's not just an artistic &quot;turn&quot; dealing with Hitler's psyche, image, and horrific legacy but instead is a powerful portrayal of him in Hell. Hell for Hitler may well be eternal self-absorption and facile self-analysis punctuated by the rare inkling of consequences of his acts and awareness of the reality of others--sporadic insights that reduce him to befuddled torment and (his worst nightmare) weakness. The actors' portral of Hitler and Goebbels are brilliant, and the film itself left me shaken. It seemed not so much an artifice as a true vision of Hell
1	Fine biography of famed French scientist This MGM-produced biography of French scientist Marie Curie is produced with the usual studio gloss. Film drags at times and presumambly plays fast and loose with the facts, but still worth a look, especially for great teaming of Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, who has some of his best moments here; his proposal scene is classic
1	A terrific li'l album that evokes a fun period and flick For those of us who came of age when "Urban Cowboy" introduced John Travolta to the world in his third iconic dance-man starring role (after Saturday Night Fever and Grease) in a productive three-year period, this soundtrack is an essential. We're all familiar with the big hits that populated this disc and dominated Top 40 radio in the early '80s, but I'd buy it solely for the haunting duet by Linda Ronstadt and J.D. Souther, "Hearts Against the Wind," that closes the show
0	Jumbled I wasn't expecting much from Pulse, and with such low expectations, I wasn't disappointed. It was everything a one- or two-star movie could hope to be. What I did find disappointing was that they had a good idea somewhere, but everyone working on the film, top down, seemed to miss it. Then again, it was a remake of a Japanese horror classic (and Japanese horror films rarely, if ever, make sense), so they weren't trying to find an original story. Pity. In an otherwise quiet college town, the suicide rate is skyrocketing. Eventually our heroes, Mattie (Kristen bell) and Dexter (Ian Somerhalder) realize that there is a virus, of sorts, in "the system", and odd, silvery specter-like creatures are the cause of it. These creatures, never explained, put themselves face-to-face with their victims and then it seems that they inhale and suck some essence from their victim, which feeds them - somehow. It makes for good viewing, but it doesn't make much sense. And because it doesn't make sense, we're not "creeped-out". Since I'm reviewing this as the DVD, and not the film, I'm giving it two-stars - because for the first time that I can recall, the special features were subtitled. As I'm hearing impaired, I normally miss out on the special features, and even though these special features weren't all that exciting, I was able to watch them.
0	A Stinky Turd My God, this is one sloppy mess of a movie. Jet Li should be ashamed of this putrid turd. Even the great fight choreographer, Cory Yuen, cannot escape being associated with this film untarnished. The story is dumb, but so what. The acting is dumb, but so what. The pathetic attempts at comedy fail abysmally, but so what. This is a martial arts film; we watch these films for the fight scenes, right? Uh-huh. Unfortunately, the fight scenes suck too, big time. The scene where Jet takes on the UFC guys is embarrassingly bad, and the MUCH anticipated fight between Jet Li and the great Mark Dacascos is a HUGE let down. Someone needs to tell editors that cutting back and forth between several action scenes absolutely ruins the flow and impact of ALL OF THEM! (This is the same bad decision that has ruined the climax of so many of the Star Wars films, but in this case, all of the action scenes going on are downright awful.) Further, DMX is just plain silly, and his nice-guy act in the film does not mesh with the meaning of the lyrics of his songs that accompany some of his character's actions on screen. Similarly, I wonder what Jet would say about some of the lyrics to some of the crap rap songs in this film, such as the violent and hateful opening song featuring the whiny, smarmy voice of Eminem--Jet is supposedly a devout Buddhist, after all, who is very opposed to violence. All-in-all, this is one big stinking mess of a film. Even as BAD martial arts films go, this one has little-to-no entertainment value whatsoever at all. It's so bad that Exit Wounds stands far above it! Watch Unleashed or Kiss of the Dragon instead, both of which are infinitely superior to this steaming pile of dog crap
0	Rhymes with "Lame" This paint-by-numbers New Zealand film is a rote Coming-of-Age / Adultery flick in which a family living by the seaside is put in moral jeopardy by a handsome stranger. Throughout the film, I kept asking myself how the parents in this nuclear unit could spend so much time at their dream house without working a steady job. Instead, it appears that everyone involved has far too much time on their hands and found that drinking themselves into oblivion will only do so much to ease the boredom. Yes, Mom (Sarah Perise) has a booze problem and the hots for the boat-bound stranger (Marton Csokas). Meanwhile, Dad (Alistair Browning) sits cuckolded in the back yard sipping hard liquor. Their two kids (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki and Aaron Murphy) don't have healthy hobbies either; spending their time cutting private parts out of porn magazines and taping them to their bodies. I suppose there is a lot of "higher meaning" going on between these "adult parts" and the lemon tree that grows in their back yard. However, I really wasn't inclined to dig deep in this overly glossy film whose plot and ending were visible from the onset. Director Jeffs muddies her water with an overabundance of slow motion shots, drawing out the tedium of RAIN. Instead of treading new ground, the film provides the audience with trite morality and one-dimensional characters
1	Killer Action & Comedy! Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a suburban couple who live in a large and beautiful house on a quiet street, have been keeping a rather large secret from one another - they are both actually assassins working for rival organizations. When the two are sent on the same job and unexpectedly discover the true nature of their respective professions, they wage war on each other, which eventually destroys the not so happy home they've been trying so hard to maintain. However, when it becomes clear that their bosses want them eliminated, they realize they have to turn to each other. Overall, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a mixture of very dark comedy and some well put together action sequences that deliver a well rounded movie going experience, but, there's some definite flaws here - some common sense issues, not to mention that there's no real villain - but the battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie - verbal and otherwise - manages to carry the picture to it's conclusion
1	hammer this dvd is hot from the good girl to the bad this is it
0	THE WORST DVD EVER IN A HUNDRED YEARS IT'S BRITNEY SO IT IS AWFUL,VAPID,PUNGENT,REVOLTING,TERRIBLE AND YUCKY.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY HAVE THIS DISGRACEFUL BRITNEY DVD YOU SHOULD BE SLAPPED.A TRUE MUSIC FAN WOULD AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.GET ANY DVD FROM QUEEN INSTEAD.ZERO STARS
1	Very good historical drama Good role for Crowe, well directed and appears to be fairly accurate of Roman Empire lif
0	Awful I was very disappointed in this movie. It had such cool cover art on the DVD that I took a chance and rented it - foolish move. It just isn't scary. It is a typical slasher type film, but with no scares, storyline, etc.. I watch many, many movies and can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the top 5 worst movies I've seen. I highly recommend staying clear of this movie
0	Not really bad but could've been a lot better The series' main flaw is the repetetiveness of the storylines, somehow even though I watched the episodes back-to-back I still felt deja-vu. The plot wouldn't advance for episodes, and I think this is what caused the ratings to plummet, they took too long to flesh out the plot so, the fans grew bored. Also, what contributed to my feelings was the showing of several identical slides in every episode! That said, it still was a fun watch, the bonds shared by the twins, Chobi, Lisa, and the enigmatic Kaze are really interesting and often funny(when not pertaining to Kaze of course). Also, the villians were not malevoloent, just mischevious which only served to affirm my opinion that this anime is more oriented towards kids. I'm not sure about the mechanism used to rate if it's final fantasy or not, but I think the fact that they had crammed all the plot twists in the last episode contributed to the criticisms, I think if the animators took some of the sub-plots out and focused on the storyline this series would've been good, instead of just decent. As it is, it's still fun, and at a bargain price; if you have nothing better to do, go ahead and watch it!(2.5 stars
0	Great Classic Needs New Transfer Badly There is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic. There was a Japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source; the intertitles were in Russian and Japanese (an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905). The opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam, and of the sailors on their cots, is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in America on any format. If the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering, we have waited three years too long for a quality DVD release. A film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all. Eisenstein directed the details, and the better the transfer the more details will be seen. None of current DVD transfers are at all acceptable
0	Read the book - it takes less time! The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style. For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy. For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character. OK, what is one to do? That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie. This is a SLOW film. It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it. I can't recommend the film
0	Kundera was right to object The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society
1	Explores the "unknown" American Revolution on the Frontier This is a great movie that just gets better with the years. Released in 1939 it had to compete with "Gone With the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz", so it ran a little under the radar. When it comes to the Revolutionary War 99% of people think Gen. Washington at Valley Forge, Brandywine and the climatic battle at Yorktown VA. Maybe more interesting and just as important was the war that was fought on the American Frontier. That is the subject of this movie and it is done well. A boyish Henry Fonda plays Gil Martin and Claudette Colbert (who received top billing over Fonda) stars as his wife, Lana. Clothing and props are authentic as well as the flintlock rifles that are used. John Carridine does a great job as "Caldwell", the Loyalist leader of the Indian forces that attack the "whig" settlers. Best of all it has been digitally remastered and looks better than ever. A special features section explains how this was done. It is good to finally see this movie on DVD and it should be in the library of everyone who enjoys historically based movies
1	Fantastic Movie A true masterpiece of cinema. This film not only showcases some of the best sound work done ever in film history, but showcases a true character perspective masterpiece. The way it is shot and the way it is stylized goes incredibly well with the plot and storyline and everything meshes incredibly well to the point where you become completely immersed with it and forget your watching a movie
0	Okay, not a barn burner though Interesting movie, little short on the story line, some of the actors were not as believable as they could have been (the native americans), the romantic scenes were over emphasized, ...I love the period in history, is the only reason I remotely like the movie
0	It is the exeption, not the rule, bad example The documentary is one of the few that Fidel Castro will allow to show on the communist Cuban television. It shows the negative side of the balseros immigrants. Completely pessimist and intentional depressing and some times it make fun about Cubans. No a good example. The director picked a very poor town were everybody is black and unlettered. The other ninety percent of the rafter or Balseros, not showed on this documentary of course, are mostly white, blue collar worker, professionals, and artists. I see then all the time. Why this documentary doesn't show to the world that Cuban is the minority more represented on the highest levels of the united stated government. Balseros that came here to work hard, learn the language, make money without selling drugs. It is the type of material that makes happy those that use to ware Che Gevara tee-shirt. I am sorry about my English, I am just a Balsero that came here eight years ago and now I am American citizen, own a hause, have my own insurance business and most at all, I am free and proud to be a cuban balsero
0	I didn't like it AT ALL! I found the characters stilted and unbelievable. These are supposed to be "REAL" people? It is just my opinion but my copy goes up for sale today
0	chopped and ruined anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft. in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the "best" scenes if you get my drift. if you want to see the original film this is not it. avoid at all costs
0	Bad one for Charlie Charles Bronson is one of my favorites, but VIOLENT CITY is example of 70's trash at it's worst. Boring slow pacing and a "see-saw" action that gets old really fast. Bronson's character is so stupid acting in this film for a hitman that you wish he would get killed off himself. I love Charles Bronson... but this is one of his dud films
1	Some of the best movies I have ever watched Each movie of the collection is a masterpiece, a refreshing experience, leaving a deep, intense after-taste. Do not miss them
0	Paradise NOT Uncut Several images are blurred out. Do not purchase this unless you want a censored version. The VHS version from Astro Video is uncut with no images blurred and has the original music
1	AWESOME!!! The title says it all!!! I cannot stop watching this DVD. I think the music is phenomenal. I only wish it were longer, and every playoff game becomes available at some point.
0	Shame on Showzen For an incredibly amazing, hilarious show, it is a shame that something that is normally closed-captioned when aired on television is not really captioned when released to DVD. Amazon says it is closed captioned, but there is nothing on the DVD box that indicates it is. Using this information, I went ahead and purchased it anyway, only to find out it was not at all. Who is really at fault I don't know, and yes I am definately bitter
1	A good piece of work Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March. This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men. This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers. The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work
1	Tha Flight of the Intruder The best air combat movie ever seen. Almost perfect
0	So bad it's hilarious! A puerile, manipulative plot in the manner of Spike Lee on a bad day, a director with a sub-median IQ who doesn't have a clue regarding how real people behave, scenery-chewing actors who rival the worst of William Shatner, not a single role to inspire sympathy or empathy. What does it all mean? A couple hours of my life down the drain. But add a tank of nitrous oxide, and you just might have a great time. This one tops my previous pick for worst movie on cable, which was "Cellular.
1	Lang's triumphant talkie debut This film is easily in the Top 5 of Fritz Lang's best films, and quite possibly his #1 best sound film as well. In addition to being Lang's debut sound film, it was also Germany's very first sound film, and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures. Almost every sound film from the late Twenties and very early Thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter, as though film-making just went backwards in time by about 30 years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true "motion pictures." But by 1931, a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out, and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece. And unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound, Lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence. He knew that the actors didn't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching. Of course, the director is only one part of the film's genius; the actors are brilliant too, in particular Peter Lorre, who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role. The film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre, what with the terrific shadows, lighting, and suspenseful mood and atmosphere. The film does start out a little slowly, but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling. The plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it. Lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well, and this film is no exception. A child murderer is on the loose, and with no answers in sight, the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty, particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals. The people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations, and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves, but to do it all without any help from the police, who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to. Even criminals have standards; it's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by "ordinary" criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did. When the criminals finally track down Hans Beckert, the murderer, at a warehouse, they tie up the night watchmen so they won't alert the police, so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves, even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there. The final section of the film, in the criminals' kangaroo court, is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film. One starts out feeling repugnance at this menace, this person who molests and kills children, but by the time the film is up, one can't help but feel sorry for him, or at least see him as a human being. We never see him hurting children, and don't even see his face right away. He's not shown as a monster or an evil person; indeed, who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer? The treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era. While what he's done isn't being excused or apologised for, he's ultimately shown to be a victim himself, a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him, doing these horrible horrible things because of it, only finding peace when he's committing these criminal acts. Is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle, people who could have become bank tellers, teachers, or doctors, people who had a choice because they didn't have this monster constantly following them? This must have been a positively revolutionary idea in 1931, when many people blamed people like Beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it, when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control. It's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it, and only gets better with multiple viewings. Extras include audio commentary, an interview with Fritz Lang a year before his death (once again he tells the tall tale of his meeting with Goebbels and how he left Germany late at night with barely any money, never to return until after WWII, even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture!), the mini-documentary 'A Physical History of M,' a gallery of pictures, stills, and drawings, an interview with Harold Nebenzal (son of producer Seymour Nebenzal), a ten-minute version of 'M' made by Claude Chabrol, and excerpts from discussions editor Paul Falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film. Overall, this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history; one can't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it. This film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film, instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it's great or if it's just overrated
0	[poor] and pretentious This film is about a female student at Randolph University in Alabama in the early 60's who is a writer for the school newspaper. She gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement. It could have been a decent movie, but I found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing. A much, much better movie on this theme is The Long Walk Home and also The Ghosts of Mississippi
0	IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU NEVER SEE THIS!!!!! I'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie, but they never achieved it!! If it's hentai or anime you are looking for this is NOT it!! There really is no plot or point to this movie. This is absolutlly the WORST movie I have ever seen!
1	Incredible Wow.What a series.It tackles all types of uncannily real situations and people.This is a real human show and left me feeling the entire gamma of feelings:crying,laughing,anger,etc.I love the family represented in six feet under and find myself talking about them and their situations with my girlfriend as if they were real people.This show reflects life so well.If you haven't watched this yet you are in for a treat.I'm saving up for the complete series.I found that we had to ration ourselves to 2 episodes a night so it would last.I love the Fishers and Keith...and Brenda...6fu is the best series of them all and I'm an owner and big fan of Deadwood,24,The Sopranos,Curb your Enthusiasm
0	Ennui would be a kind descriptor Clocking in at just under two hours, I LOVE YOUR WORK leaves the viewer feeling as though from the opening sequence that stones have been tied to your feet and your body thrown into the very deep and dank water to slowly settle into the mud at the bottom. Sound dreary? Then avoid this little mess of a film. It is hard to believe that Adrian Butchart who is giving us the radiant GOAL! THE DREAM BEGINS trilogy could help write this script: one wonders if writer/director Adam Goldberg didn't just bring him in for help. The story is tired (small time guy gives up love for a career as a movie star with all the accessories of money, fame, celeb status, gorgeous wife, etc. only to find life in its simpler fashion was preferable) and the choices of casting this very dark and dreary tale are inappropriate. Giovanni Ribisi, superb an actor though he most assuredly is, simply is not credible as a movie star sex symbol whose stardom is accompanied by alcoholism, self hate, paranoia, fragmented thinking, and bad decisions. The only time we see anything vaguely suggestive of his ability to create a role is in the many flashback scenes (with girlfriend Christina Ricci): his on screen chemistry with his famous wife Mia (the enormously talented Franka Potente who here is wasted in a mannequin's role) is nil, and his interplay with such actors as Vince Vaughn, Marisa Coughlan, Judy Greer, Shalom Harlow, Joshua Jackson, Jason Lee, and Elvis Costello is unilateral. Goldberg films this boring redundant tale using all manner of artsy camera tricks that only serve to make the tedium increase. With a cast like this the product had promise. Goldberg needs some time to think about this phase of his career. Grady Harp, November 06
0	Great Language Features Band Camp was funny, but not as good as the first two American Pie movies. It was, however, on par with the third movie in the series. There were the usual silly, outrageous pranks and there were a few characters from the previous movies, but not the main characters. This movie was fun and worth watching, but probably not really worth watching again EXCEPT for the the language features. The movie comes dubbed in Spanish and French, plus you can have subtitles in several languages while viewing the movie in any language. SO, this movie might provide a fun way of developing or brushing up on your foreign language skills
1	Leon Cannot rate this film high enough. It is in my top 5 films of all time! The acting is fantastic, the story gripping, the action feels real, and then you have the wonderful Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, if you don't see this film, it is your loss
1	Caution - May be dangerous to your health! When Darkwing Duck first aired on television, I was recuperating from a broken back and on some really good meds. I laughed so hard that I nearly did myself another injury. Now the first season is available on DVD, and I am here to tell you that even without the meds, Darkwing is still hilarious. My youngest granddaughter and I have watched them all, together, and she loves to "get dangerous."
0	Dont like the banners I bought this for projection shows for the visuals only and though it has some cool visuals, it also has on screen titles & banners that ruin the visuals
1	Great companion to the CD If you Love Daryl Hall & John Oates, you will love this new DVD! Daryl, John & the band singing live all the songs from their latest CD Our Kind of Soul. They are great recorded, but unbelievable performing live! Rock Steady is a great up beat tune, and the sad, but beautiful Neither One of Us is very poignant. Due to the multi layered nuances of After The Dance, this will probably be the only time you will see this great, haunting song sung live by Hall & Oates.
0	Hitchcock has done better Don't let the title fool you as it did me. For whatever reason, I led myself to believe the whole movie took place on a train in the same fashion Rear Window takes place all within one location. It doesn't, but part of me wished it had. As far as the plot goes, two strangers meet on a train. Guy, a pro tennis star, and Bruno, a psychotic socialite. He proposes to Guy that they both help each other, with Bruno murdering Guy's cheating wife, and in return Guy killing Bruno's father. Part of this felt very Throw Mama From the Train to me, but more funny. Anyway, I have come to expect great things, and high tension from Hitchcock, and sorry to say, he didn't deliver this time around. The best part of this movie is Robert Walker's portrayal of Bruno, who seems friendly and normal, but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes, you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get. His performance reminded me eerily of Kevin Spacey. If they were to remake this movie (and as much as I despise remakes, I believe they are planning one), they'd be foolish not to offer it to him. So for what it's worth, Hitchcock is still the master, but don't let this be your introduction to him if you're new to his body of work, there are many superior choices
0	The Yankees dont come up to scatch This is a poor production when compared to the Ken Burn's masterpiece "Baseball". Only for the deeply committed Yankee fans. It may be accurate but it isn't "history
0	WORST EVER! Wow E! must have the best editors in the world! I must have REALLY forgotten what the show was like, but i do remember liking it. However the DVD version is soo slow and there are many, many scenes where no one has anything to say to each other. Not the fun show i remember at all. Bobby Trendy is actually the funny one here. Anna is beautiful and fun and Howard is like the guy you can't stand but can't get rid of. Is he really an attorney? wo
1	BLOWN AWAY GOOD! OK, so let's talk about the MUSIC and the performance on this Eagles concert HD-DVD. NOTHING BUT AWESOME! Just what I'd expect from these boys. Twenty-five, or so, songs, performed live with studio-quality sound perfection and singular performances by each and every member of this beloved American band! The HD-DVD cinematography, lighting, and color is beautiful - almost better than being there. Pretty much all of the songs you remember and love the eagles for; ya know - Hotel California, Tequilla Sunrise, Take it Easy, .... etc. Some new stuff as well. Joe Walsh sings a good new upbeat tune about zoning through his earlier life due to alcohol. Lots of fun, big excited audience, great horn section, superb backup drummer, guitarist, keyboards. My only complaint is about the direction with respect to guitar playing - I really wanted to see more about how Walsh and their other awesome guy (don't know his name) made those awesome sounds. Oh well. Now, about HD-DVD players: I got the XBox 360 HD-DVD add-on. It was sub-standard, IMO. I returned it and got the real deal Toshiba stand-alone HD-DVD player with the independent analog audio inputs (you've got to get the analog surround inputs if you want to really experience HD-DVD sound on the recent Toshiba players). So get real and get a dedicated HD-DVD player and CHECK OUT THOSE EAGLES! I have a 100" screen front projection HD projector, 1200 Watt pioneer sound box, and about $3000 worth of full size 7.1 surround speakers. It rally gets me in the "zone." But you don't need this much equipment to enjoy this great Eagles HD-DVD - just a dedicated HD-DVD player. BTW, if you love music, only the HD-DVD standard REQUIRES technically superior sound on each and every HD-DVD released - not so on Blu-Ray. So go HD-DVD
1	BZZZzzzzzzzzzz... &quot;The Fly&quot; is a well made / known sci-fi classic. Andre (David Hedison) is a scientist, working on a contraption that disintegrates solid matter, sending it to another location to be re-integrated. Andre wants to develop it for the good of mankind, but that would make for one dull movie! Instead, he accidentally enters the disintegration chamber with an undetected fly. The two become fused into one being. Andre ends up with a fly head and claw. The fly gets Andre's head and upper body. Andre's wife is tested to the depths of her love for her now hideous husband. A frantic search for the tiny fly ensues (maybe they could de-fuse them??) with tragic results. Vincent Price is excellent as Andre's brother. Yes, it's true that &quot;Return Of The Fly&quot; is nowhere near as good as it's predocessor. However, I like having them both together anyway. Andre's son Phillipe is all grown up and decides to continue his father's work. He enlists the help of a guy who turns out to be a sociopathic criminal, bent on stealing the invention and selling it to an accomplice. After killing a nosey cop (by turning him into a guinea pig man), he knocks Phillipe out and puts him in the disintegration cabinet with a suspiciously handy fly. The rest of the film is a revenge story. I like the crooks and the way Phillipe avenges their treachery. A great double feature! Pop some corn, pour the beverages, and check the house for those pesky insects..
0	A 'minor' note Content of the movie aside, has no one noticed the cover of the DVD??? The American flag is backwards!!! The field of blue is always on the LEFT if the flag is hanging vertical. I'm glad that Disney didn't get to build its American history theme park in northern Virginia back in the 80's. If they can't get a simple DVD cover right, just imagine what could have happened
0	Mr. L Mapes I was very disappointed in this product, as the recordings were the worst I've ever seen. I could have done a better job of recording these for re-sale. With all the Computor knowledge that we have today, it's a shame that a product of this quality would be sold. Amazon, you messed up good this time.
0	Read Between the Lines If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting. Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent. Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go. The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has. Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange. By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall? This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease
1	Better than Vanilla Sky This movie was much better than "Vanilla Sky." "Vanilla Sky" mostly copied "Open Your Eyes" but was too obvious and less convincing. (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.) "Open Your Eyes" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where "Vanilla Sky" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in "Vanilla Sky" is poorly done, whereas "Open Your Eyes" represents the dream experience very well. I recommend watching both movies before you buy one. But if you're going to buy, get "Open Your Eyes.
0	Anger management fails... I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching.
1	Good but not Great A very sensitive and touching movie about a boy and his teacher. It has some gratutious scenes and the story does not flow very smoothly, but none the less worth watching and the ending reveals alot about humanity throughout the ages.
1	Innauguration of the Pleasure Dome a Pleasure Indeed If you've seen the old Mystic Fire VHS of these films, you will be amazed at the quality of this DVD. Innauguration is breathtakingly vivid. I haven't even been able to watch all of the films yet, only Eaux d'Artifice and Innauguration, but I was so enthused by what I had seen that I couldn't wait to get on here and praise it. Ken is a visionary film maker in the most literal sense of the word. These films also come from an interesting milieu of individuals and circumstances and are important historical documents as well as lovely works of art. As a Thelemite, I have long admired Anger's art and his dedication to promulgating Aleister Crowley's teachings. Yet his art, although rooted in a Thelemic idiom, is not trapped by it, and it should appeal to anyone interested in the visual language of transcendence. I'm already slavering for volume II
0	the wedding dress I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what
1	Good but not as good as 1st 2 movies I like this movie the least of the Mad Max trilogy. Anyways, several years after the events of "The Road Warrior", "Mad" Max is still wandering the wastlands of the post-apocalyptic Australia. He shows up at a "semi-civilization" called, Bartertown. Where through events that would take to long to describe, he ends up being forced to fight in a arena called, Thunderdome. Where he soon escapes (creating alot of havoc for Bartertown) and escapes in to the desert. Where he is found by a bunch of Goonie-like kids,and they sorta annoy me.I wonder why they put them into it when Mad Max was based on car crashes rather than playschool.I know i will get people trying to tell me that scene was good,cause the kids acted well,but i thought it was crap.Also it lacked his brilliant car,i know it got smashed up,but they coulda made it so he found another cool car. The script lacked punch i think.Some of the acting was average. I remember being excited when they said this movie was being released,only to be disappointed because it simply does not match it with mad max 2. But after seeing it quite a few times,i do enjoy it,but i just cant feel satisfied with it comparing it to the first 2 installments to this trio. But its still quite a good movie
1	Finally on DVD - and worth the wait! I've always had a soft spot for this cheese-fest from the 60's, and since I am a MAJOR Inger Stevens fan, this is a must-have. The good news here is that the print is excellent, and has both the wide-screen version, which is the best version - LOTS of picture image is cropped out of the pan'n'scan version, as well as the "full-frame" pan'n'scan chopped up version for those that insist on these inferior video image displays. Tons of cool cameos, fantastic title song by The Turtles make this a winner. No extras other than the trailer, but I say if you liked this movie in the past or just like those wacky 60's sex-comedies this is an essential purchase.
1	Not enough stars I'm sure some folks will not agree with with me and thats ok. I think there are not enough stars to rate this. Three big reasons: 1) The Beatles 2) The other acts 3) Commercials Trip down memory lane for me back to grade school. And I kept hearing my Dad [...] about the "long hair", when 4 years later he would have bought me a car if I wore my hair that short. What a gem. At least for me
1	Interesting Spy thriller Interesting and different role for George Segal. The movie takes you into the "confusing world of espionage". Very watchable older movie and done without all the modern day pyrotechnics. Some other familiar actors/actresses are also present
1	Perfect in every way. This DVD is truly inspiring, the things she can do while so heavely preagnant is amazing. Its got the whole body covered. And you keep thinking if she can do you so can you. One of the best DVD's for pregnant women out there. One can even do it if you're not pregnaunt. The three training levels, Beginnger, Intermediate and Advance makes this DVD perfect for first timers, and it is challenging enough for those whose been exercising. I Love it and recommend anyone and every one to add it to your collection
1	Hugely Entertaining and Rewarding Mystery OK, I'm not a film critic. I do like older movies, especially Hitchcock mysteries and John Wayne Westerns and that makes me decidedly middle-brow. All I can say is that 'Dial M for Murder' is a hugely entertaining mystery that rewards the viewer who pays attention (umm, it is a mystery after all). Several delicious plot twists
0	Only in 2 channel stereo and to much talking & interviews Wow, she has to travel and stay in hotels. Never would have guessed that.
0	Below Average &quot;My Reflections&quot; dvd is much better as it is a concert. This dvd is a bunch of videos and interviews. Not a keeper. Rent in first.
1	Bloody Sunday The best movie I have seen in a long time Have watched it a few times and never get tried of it It brought home what the people of Ireland had to go through and the heartache
1	Loved it! Rose Red combines many likes! I loved the movie in the way it is not too grose for children to watch, but is has suspence, mistery, ghosts and other paranormal all mixed into one. Easy to follow and loved the amount of background informatio
1	More Show!!!! I really enjoyed this dvd because it had more of the show filmed than in the vhs riverdance - the show. It is a little bit of an annoyance that I have to flip it over in the middle. I definately like Colin Dunne's dancing better than Michael Flateley's, Colin doesn't seem to steal the spotlight away from Jean Butler as much as Michael did. It gets my thumbs up
1	Enthralling, painful, profound, cathartic Thoreau said "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." While this may be true of some, others are not so quiet. Caouette has unleashed a tidal wave of agony and angst, at times a shill scream of adolescent suffering, at other times a low moan of early adult-onset life affliction. Truly, many of us know the feeling of wanting to explode and fill the void with the screech of our own inner turmoils, but lack the voice, the means, the mechanisms. For want of a method we seeth silently, voiceless, castrated, invisible. We want to be known and loved and understood and instead we stammer and stutter and fall silent. We pack in our caring and seal our emotions and vulnerabilities behind high walls of rationality and apathy. Or we scribble in diaries or blogs and our hidden solitary torture goes wholly unnoticed. Caouette has commendably captured in video and audio snippets, in stills and captions, a glimpse into the troubled past that haunts and harasses him. He has undertake a photo collage of his own life experience, himself as the subject matter and the material. I cannot know how much he left on the cutting room floor, what he felt necessary or desireable to expunge, but he seems to have faced it all with remarkable candor and vulnerability. He survived a rural Southern upbringing, a father-less household, poverty, a love of film, and homosexuality. To that potent melange, he added mental illness, abandonment, foster care, PCP, physical and sexual abuse. I cannot say that I understand his life even after viewing it or that I can even relate to some of the events that shaped him. But through his art I feel that I can say I know a little of him and I can say that I empathize with his pain. I will never walk a mile in his shoes, but I don't think I have to in order to care about the tribulations and fate of another human being. It is his candor and vulnerability, his willingness to expose the deepest parts of his own psyche and say "Here I am, look at me." that makes me care about him. That gives me a reason to watch and wonder, How did he turn out? Seeing the first half of the project, one would be forgiven for thinking "This will end badly." That one of these stark text captions will announce his successful suicide and provide that closing parenthesis to his life: Jonathan Caouette (1975 - 200x). Ultimately, I think he redeemed himself and perhaps transcended his lot in life. What I saw as the film continued was a man coming to terms with himself and his past. A man demonstrating that he is capable of finding love and connecting with others. A man who did not harbor resentments for the wrongs done to him and his mother, did not harbor a grudge toward his father or grandparents for abandonment or abuse. Rather, I saw a thoughtful, emotional, caring man, a creative artist, a loving partner and a devoted son. His journey is not yet complete, but as the film concluded, I felt a compassion and a sense of optimism, for not just Jonathan, but for all of us.
1	great for toddlers !!! My daughter loves this DVD! At age 2 she can already say her ABCs, recognize all the letters individually, and even write some small words. This is a wonderful, educational DVD
0	hip hop documentary??!?? Straight from the streets wasn`t what I expected. If you ask me this isn`t even a documentary about hip hop, more a documentary on black people. On this DVD you have a lot of black people talkin how they shouldn`t fight amongst each other, how they should unite and stuff like that. Besides the interviews with ice t and the low rider show this dvd has nothing to offer. It is NOT A HIP HOP DOCUMENTARY, if you want a hip hop documentary on DVD, buy Rhyme &amp; Reason
1	The BARD: Who Was He??? +++++ "What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties! In form and moving, how express and admirable! In action, how like an angel! In apprehension, how like a god! The beauty of the world! The paragon of animals!" The man this program is in search for is the one who wrote the above beautiful words and, as well, wrote many verses and words like it. His name: William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616), "[a man] not of an age, but for all time." Surprisingly, not much is known of Shakespeare's life, until now. The enthusiastic Michael Wood takes us on a wonderful trek to discover just who Shakespeare was. We learn about such things as follows: his parentage; his birth; his times, the politics and religion of the time; his youth; his marriage and loves; his "lost" years; his London years; his career; and his plays and sonnets. There are four parts to this program (originally aired on the Public Broadcasting Station). Each includes a very brief introduction that I will reproduce here: (1) A Time of Reformation (9 scenes including introduction and credits) "Like all stories in history, this is a search for ghosts. A quest for the people that made us what we are. And for one man in particular. William Shakespeare is the most famous writer of all times...Yet his life is still shrouded in mystery...This is a historical detective story...searching for the life of William Shakespeare of Stratford Upon the Avon." This is the only part where Wood gives a summary. He says, "There's the first nineteen years of Shakespeare's life. [Wood then proceeds with his brief summary...] and that's just the beginning of the story!" (2) The Lost Years (8 scenes) "How did a poor country boy...become such a celebrity so soon after he arrived in London? It's one of the great mysteries of Shakespeare's life...Ten years before Shakespeare had been...in Stratford with no job and few prospects. How did he do it? How did he make that leap? And what did he do in those ten years?" (3) The Duty of Poets (8 scenes) "In the 1590s the English theatre entered its golden age and for the next twenty years its brightest star was William Shakespeare. But back in the early 1590s, Shakespeare was one of many gifted young poets. What was it that transformed him in the next few years to the greatest thing anybody had ever seen. What happened to him in his career and his private life?" (4) For All Time (8 scenes) "For William Shakespeare, 1603 was a very good year. Writer, actor, director, he was now the artist and chief of Elizabethan theatre. He created some of the greatest characters in literature...In [England], theatre wasn't just entertainment, it was popular and political - it had a thrilling and dangerous power. Shakespeare...is...in his late thirties...Out of the experience of his life and the turbulent times through which he lived, the new worlds and the lost worlds, he pulls it all together in some of the greatest works of literature ever written. It's that last story and the mysterious end to his career that we're going to uncover." Wood travels extensively to different places, talking and interviewing people. He even reads from the actual historical documents that indicate something about Shakespeare, some of it uncovered only recently! The cinematography is breathtaking. The photography inside actual buildings of Shakespeare's time is fantastic. The background music compliments Wood's narrative. Special mention should be given to the Royal Shakespearean Company who travel with Wood. They act out bits of not only Shakespeare's plays but other plays of that time (such as those of his rival, Christopher Marlowe). You'll hear bits of his plays from each of these categories: the Romantic Comedies (example: "A Midsummers Night Dream"); the Histories (example: "Henry IV," Part 1); Tragedies (example: "Macbeth"); and the Tragicomic Romances (example: "The Tempest"). (There was no example from his "Problem" plays.) There is one DVD extra (about twenty minutes) that has eight scenes. It is quite good. The DVD's picture and sound quality were perfect. There were no distracting artifacts. Finally, if you're a William Shakespeare fanatic like I am, then you'll enjoy this program. I learned a lot of new things that I was not aware of before. If you're a newcomer to Shakespeare's life then I envy you. This program is the best introduction to his life, in my opinion, that there is. In conclusion, be sure to view this program and find out why Shakespeare discovered that the duty of poets was "to speak what we feel and not what we ought to say!" (2003; 4 hours; 2 discs; made for TV; wide screen) +++++
1	Overhyped cult film finally makes good. I'd seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn't that impressed. Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be. Thanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks. (Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold. C'mon Lucas, you know you can't resist any excuse to re-release yet another DVD version of your little sci-fi sextology. Give the man a call.
1	good movie for the little budget they had! i saw this movie first as well as reincarnation and i gotta say, stop hate'n on it cause of the budget! this is the best low budget flick ive seen so far with good f/x for the money they had to spend. it has a good plot if you listen and watch carefully so dont hate on the movie because of the production
0	Why? This is a completely ridiculous and unrealistic movie. Josie, at 25, is still not over the fact that she was unpopular in high school, and whines for the entire movie. It's unclear why any one likes her, espesially her teacher. It's also hard to get over the fact that the teacher, beleiving that she is in high school, makes no attempt to hide his feelings. The final scenes tie nothing together and the issue of her betrail is not delt with. Never Been Kissed isn't good as a silly unbeleivable comedy; it's both painful to watch and devoid of any redeaming qualities in its content
0	Not Worth Your Time The only good thing about this movie is the plot. From there it goes downhill. The script needs to be rewritten to add some sophistication to it. The acting is marginal except for the actor that plays Justin. If the script were rewritten then I think the acting would be better, maybe
1	Wow. How to get busted in a totalitarian regime: make a film like Firemen's Ball. Just watched that last night. Amazed. Brilliant transfer. May not be as poignant as Loves of a Blonde or his later works, but a rousing critique of the regime with some really funny scenes. But, again, that transfer amazed me. Hard to believe it's a 35 year old czech film. Highly recommended. Enjoyed Forman's comments on the film and the debacle that ensued. He was almost locked up for 10 years and was luckily helped out by none other than Francois Truffaut! Beautiful
0	Watch "The Bird with the Crystal Plummage" GIALLO instead. I waited ages to get this Fulci classic and now I wished I did not. It is probably Fulci's most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film #33 from him. I can buy GIALLO being a bit spaced out and highly far-fetched, but this one is just plain bad from start to finish, it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence (chain whipping also appeared in "The Beyond"; Fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff), "Don't Torture a Duckling" is completely void of substance, mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making, from the obvious papermashy heads to the "shall I stand here and act now" type blemish on everyone's face, considering this is Fulci's 33rd film or thereabouts, it really looks like his first and it would be another 8 years before he made horror, I was expecting a somewhat smart GIALLO and got drawn out rubbish instead. Like I said - Watch "The Bird with the Crystal Plummage" GIALLO instead. It was made by Argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead. I would recommend that Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's cash crop schlock "Don't Torture a Duckling" any day of the week
1	"Our daddy's gonna kill you, preacher!" I think that line (spoken by a crowd of evil children before they beat up an unarmed, chained Russell Crowe) sums up the movie well. This movie does an excellent job of communicating the sheer GLEE of sadism. Everyone in this movie (with the partial exceptions of Stone and Crowe) don't just like to inflict pain on others - they ENJOY it. They cackle and quip and snicker and guffaw as they blast enormous, ragged, bleeding holes into people. This is an excellent (if somewhat garish and comic-bookish) look at an evil that has infected a whole town. Imagine Eastwood's more sinister and sometimes turgid attempts (High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven come to mind), but with a wink and a sense of humor. More slow-mo than the Olympics. Pioneered the bullet cam that has since been done to death. Ms Stone shows a lot of leg. So, it's got a lot going for it is what I'm saying.
1	Five stars are not enough Having read through most of the other reviews of this excellent series, I find there is little new praise to add. We stumbled upon this series when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre one evening and have been hooked ever since. Kitchen conveys volumes about his character's inner turmoil and thoughts--without speaking a single word. By watching the delightful interplay between Foyle and Sam, between father and son, between employer and subordinate, friend and friend, you discover nuggets of each person's upbringings, beliefs, losses, and fears. The mostly-unseen character who influences them all, the soon-to-invade German army, continuously forces each character to internally re-examine his or her priorities and decisions. This series is superb. Anyone interested in mysteries or in history will thoroughly enjoy.
1	Lola's Running I thought this product was awsome, a classic, cheaply priced, and I recieved item way before the delivery date. Recommend buying movies from this seller. This movie was creative (although it was in subtitles), and equally unique from any of the other movies I found over the internet.
0	Save your money I bought this DVD based on the excellent reviews. As both an afficionado, and practitioner of kink, I am always looking for a good film in that genre. Not only is "Maitresse" poorly acted but the story line is completely unbelievable. I also found the film "quality" leaving a lot to be desired. (Poor lighting) I found myself falling asleep about a third of the way through and just could not get into it. The relationship and communication between the Domme and her clients was cold and unfeeling, and left me with the impression that I had just watched two robots doing physical things with each other. There was just no chemistry between the players. Save your money
0	A Disappointment...Ugh...Not recommended. For those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a S/M relationship, I would highly suggest the Japanese film, "Moonlight Whispers" over "Maitresse." That film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme, while "Maitresse" is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a (highly unlikely) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix. The ex-con cannot deal with "her career" eventually and threatens her to quit, etc. (At some point, you get the idea that the director himself really doesn't understand where the Domina is coming from.) What started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through. The writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection (or pimp, for want of a better word). Then, we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse, where a real horse is shown killed onscreen, strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly (this image will upset you for weeks, believe me! [I feel like it's my duty to WARN YOU!]). And the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots. Totally stupid (like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas). Believe me, I really WANTED to like this movie. I ignored the negative reviews, because there are so few "real" films on this subject. But I was sorely disappointed and depressed by it. If you need to see this film, rent it. It's definitely a "one view" film at best; and it will be a film that will leave you angry (because the horse scene) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out. Too bad. "Moonlight Whispers" is a much better, respectful treatment of S/M, a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological (and sexual orientation) questions, while also being a beautiful film to watch. That film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience!
0	redford/gandolfini cannot save terrible script Redford is a 3 star general sentenced to 10 years, for what we later learn is sending men to die in a mission contradicting a presidential order. Gandolfini is the brutal military prison warden, who orders the death of a soldier/prisoner, inciting Redford to lead the men in revolt. The problem is both men are cut from the same cloth, as the script poorly distinguishes them. This complexity is useful, but not when neither character is worth rooting for. The most telling scene is when a reluctant follower asks the ex-General if leading men is just moving pieces on a chessboard to him. Redford answers it is, and we infer this is 'the burden of command,' his book on warfare, i.e. the ends justify the means in battle. It is hard to become a pawn for the great military machine, when the cause is unjust or not worth the price. Here, the men can just follow the severe code versus revolt. While Gandolfini's warden goes too far, his justification of needing order is reasonable. He tries to get Redford shipped out on mental issues, delusions of taking command. The problem is, Redford really does what the Warden says shows mental infirmity. As if he cant adjust to not commanding thousands, he invents a battle. The battle seems as much about the General's need to command troops and teach the Warden a lesson as anything else. No real reason was given as to why his personal connections could not have fixed the prison problems, and they were already going that way as Redford met with the Warden's superior, who 'put him on notice.' In addition to poor character development, taking one step back the whole basis and execution of conflict in a prison yard is laughable. Last, the ending is so insipid, everyone who sees it will think of 5 ways it could have ended more intelligently. The film instead tries to make a tearjerker when no such ending was needed or justified. A great film of the evil nature of man's institutions is One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. A great war film for moral ambiguity is Platoon. Last Castle is a must miss
1	THE SCENE FROM JOHN, RAISING LAZARUS... This is a traditional telling of the life of Jesus, from before his birth to the resurrection. The cinematography is breathtaking, the color, the costuming, the writing aided by Carl Sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of Jesus weeping and then raising Lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring. It was this scene which motivated me to write this review. Rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb, Stevens has Jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff, puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill. Once there, Jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of Ivan Mestrovic and the French bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century. When Jesus reaches the high tomb, Stevens and Sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the God of life before Jesus calls out, "LAZARUS! COME FORTH!" But in striking juxtaposition, Stevens pulls back the camera, hundreds of feet from the tomb showing Jesus, the Son of the Almighty, as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside, let alone the universe, much as the fist fight between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck in BIG COUNTRY, shows the scale of man to God's work. However, as Jesus calls-out Lazarus instead of seeing him rise, we see the wonderment, the bewilderment, the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss. We see in the crowd, as the camera dollies, rolls and scans, the faces of the believers, the unbelievers, the doubters and the ever faithful, their reactions to a man dead three days, reawakened by an act of God, brought forth by a human being, favored by God. How much more effective was this direction? Rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise, we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing, the awe, the tears of joy, the fear, the love, the attempts to reconcile with reality, the unbelievable. There was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring artist or film director. My only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one, Jesus' (Max Von Sydow) hair is too short. If you believe, clap your hands, and even if you don't, its worth the 199 minutes of your time. I saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the VHS and DVD, and watched it with a group, one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the Lazarus scene. 4.75 Star
0	Highly disappointing, definitely not for everyone the trouble with this DVD is that it is too fast, too brief and with no real outline of pilates for 'everyone' as the title implies. This is a reasonable pilates work out for those who have done pilates in the past and want to try something new. However I found the conduct of each exercise too fast for me. I like to do my pilates slowly, and each exercise seems to be dynamic rather than some done quite slowly. There is little variation for beginnners who want to do simpler easier exercises. There was some brief discussion from austin about alternatives, but it is all done during the exercises, so it is of little use. It is definitely not for beginners either as it has no real discussion of how to hold yourself in the core, and anchor yourself to the floor. It is definitely a quick once over. I enjoyed some variation on the routine which she offers in this, but it is not recommended for the beginner as a starter to pilates. There are some very good books which can get your started, I loved Brooke Siler's book which gave an excellent discussion of how to achieve the core exercises and alternatives.
1	'Bowled over, big time! Another NFL season gone, another round of NFL playoffs comin' up (as of this writing). This is the time I usually look back on those great Super Bowl teams of yore by whippin' out those half-hour Super Bowl highlight shows I taped offa ESPN2 several years back. That is, until NFL Films finally saw the light and put the first thirty together in separate DVD box sets, now combined into this super-set. Now I can watch my fave Super Bowl shows (AKA the 49er and Redskins victories, and the ones the Cowboys, Rams, & Raiders lost) don't have to worry about my gradually deteriorating VHS tapes getting eaten by my VCR! While I thought the recap shows alone were worth the bucks I threw down, NFL Films added even more value to the presentation by throwing two featurettes in with each Super Bowl game. Included among the mini-shows in games I to X are brief profiles of the careers of Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Bob Lilly, Jack Lambert, and Roger Staubach. Also showcased: the silent enigma that was Cowboys RB Duane Thomas, the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season and their famed(?) "No-Name" defense of the early 70s, the legacy of Tom Landry, the fights that broke out between CBS and NBC before, during, and after their simultaneous broadcast of Game I, the Minnesota Vikings setting the standard for Super Bowl futility, and other sideline stuff I never knew about before. Then there's the second decalogue of highlights from "The Great American Time-Out", featuring both good moments (the 49ers' first two wins in XVI & XIX; The `Skins' first Super Bowl Championship in game XVII, and the Bears' 46 defense stealing the show in game XX) and not-so-great ones (The Raiders claiming games XI, XV, and XVIII, and the Cowboys picking up their second Lombardi trophy after XII). While I found most of the featurettes in the XI to XX run kinda interesting, I was also driven to nausea by the sappiness of a few of `em. Runnin' the Saccharine-o-meter to the red zone was the piece on Anthony Munoz and his NFL prospect son, Howie Long discussing his life in football and how he's been keepin' himself busy after his retirement, and Jim Plunkett pulling himself off of the NFL scrap heap to lead the Raiders to two Super Bowl championships. I swear, if I hear one more interview where someone was talking about how much heart ol' what's-his-face had, or how so-and-so's toughness & drive really inspired the rest of the team, I'm gonna need insulin treatments! Finally, there's the third decalogue of shows, featuring the good (the 49ers' last three championships & the `Skins' last two), the bad (the Giants escaping game XXV with the win, and the Cowboys grabbin' three Lombardis in four seasons in games XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX), and the downright ugly (The Broncos and Bills match the Vikings' record for Super Bowl haplessness). Sadly, most of the contests recapped here were more like "Stupor Bowls" (see my ListMania on this coma-inducing phenomenon at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/POLOADG90JFT/ref=cm_aya_av.lm_more/102-8646183-3962510 ), featuring the bulk of the NFC's 13 year dominance of the big dance, including the only two Super Bowls where the winning team scored 50 points or more (XXIV and XXVII). A couple games were close at halftime (XXI & XXVIII), but the NFC champions eventually managed to pull well away from their less-than-capable AFC opponents in the second half. Fortunately, there was a halfway decent Super Bowl (XXX) along with two of the greatest ever played (XXIII featuring Joe Montana's legendary drive, and Buffalo kicker Scott Norwood's "miss heard `round the world" in XXV) to help keep the boredom from setting in too deeply. Adding a touch of excitement to both the "blah" games and the smattering of close ones is the wonderful background music, which is some of the most exciting soundtrack tunage I've ever laid my ears on. BTW I'm glad to see NFL Films has seen the light and finally put a whole buncha these tracks out on CD (check it out at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002VERQA/ref=cm_aya_wlasin.title/102-8646183-3962510?v=glance&coliid=I49VMCS3COBJX&colid=35SRBZ4ZQ8HU3 )... Unfortunately, there were a couple things that I noticed were amiss: the Supe XXI and XXIII shows have been edited down a bit. I recall the XXI show being titled "Land of the Giants" during the "opening credits" sequence when I caught it on ESPN2, but when I saw it on DVD here, the "Land of the Giants" title had been deleted. More heavily edited was the opening title ("Drive to Greatness") & credits sequence to the Game XXIII show, which was completely excised. The featurettes in this set usually cover the players who coached or participated in each game (Doug Williams as the Super Bowl's first black quarterback in XXII, Steve Young in XXIX, etc.) or breaks down the most memorable moment in that game (like the Niners' game-winning drive in XXIII, Norwood's miss in XXV, Leon Lett-ing a TD get away in XXVII, etc.). Like the previous sideshows, the XXI-to-XXX mini-films were a bit sappy... Now I'm wondering if NFL Films will wait until after game XL is played before they put out the final box set-- well, "final" `til games XLI to L have been played, anyway-- or will they do it shortly after XXXIX, and leave the set one Super Bowl short of a full ten? Personally, I'm hoping they go for the former option; I'm patient enough that I could stand to wait an extra year to get a complete ten-game set. But even if they don't wait, set four will likely be the most exciting of the bunch, featuring the best bits of XXXII (John Elway & the Broncos finally winning it all), XXXIV (the Titans end up a yard short of tying the game as time runs out), and XXVI & XXVIII (the Pats' Adam Vinatieri becomes the first kicker to win two Super Bowls with field goals in the closing moments). In any case, I can hardly freakin' wait... `Lat

1	"Tom Baxter's come down off the screen and he's running around New Jersey!... Nobody knows how it happened, but he's done it." "The Purple Rose of Cairo" was the first Allen's movie I saw back in Moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films. "The Purple Rose..." is wonderful, is one if Allen's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor, romance and drama, reality and fiction. It is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man (Danny Aiello). Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day, as she watches "Purple Rose of Cairo" for the 10th or maybe 15th time, the leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and "trapped" in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening. On the top of all, Tom Baxters in other theaters try to leave "Purple Rose of Cairo", too... It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line (in this film, the silver screen) that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet, gentle, sad, technically realized and simply terrific as "Purple Rose of Cairo". 9.5/10
0	Yet another complaint I'll add my complaint to the others who find that bundling Cold Comfort Farm with another movie I don't want is stupid
1	A great movie but is it the same as the theatrical release? I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since. The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics. Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater. Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations. The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player. Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics. At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so. The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater. In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice. It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love. The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly. They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie. I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone. On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer. There are no deleted scenes. This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college. I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony. I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more. So where is the version with the alternative ending???
1	BEST DVD/TV Workout!!! I was revisiting this page because my sister-in-law just told me there is a new dvd out! so...trying to find out more! I LOVE this workout and tell everyone about it honestly! I don't have extensive ballet skills at all...unless you call 2nd grade having any ballet skills! AND this does not seem that strenuous to me AT ALL - i almost thought it was a waste of time as me and my husband did this for the first time in 2000/2001 (seemed too easy), but...after the second time of doing this and you start to feel your muscles coming to life again and you start to hold things (like my kids!) with your upper body the way you are suppose to! It's amazing...the abs section for any mom trying to get back in shape is AMAZING! and right along the line of what my doctor recommended, but you somehow feel more elegant doing it to classic music with the soft voice directing you! I don't normally love dvd/tv exercising would much rather go out for a walk, etc...but this is so good to tone your muscles and help you feel strong! or as the front of the dvd states "Stretches and Exercises ANYONE Can Do for a Strong, Graceful and Sculpted Body" I TOTALLY Agree and seeing as my husband did this with me the first time (and there is also a sports option to help strengthen him for skiing!) I don't understand where people are saying they had a hard time following it... Maybe they couldn't keep up, but...any aerobics class, yoga class or pilates class i've ever been to - the instructor usually say the same thing just do as much as you can and just as long as you keep moving you are getting the benefit and once you do it a couple of time you will get the hang of it! that's what practice is for - no one is perfect typically the first time
1	arthur lee forever! the time he was given was such a little while, but his music was way more than style. i would rate this dvd one notch above 5 stars. let's call it goosebumps. buy it for the experience. the referral is free
1	Best Season This is Miami Vice's best season - at least to me. The stars, music and Testerosa all come to together for insiteful and consistent episodes each week. And I appreciate the improved packaging so I don't have to flip DVD's to watch more. Any Vice fan needs Season 3.
1	DVD Bonus Features alone is worth getting this disc Like finding the Titanic in the backwoods of Kentucky, in AWE!!! Awesome extra DVD features, touching Interviews and insight on Waverly HIlls. It kind of freaked me out all that vile stuff thrown in the woods. If you love creepy things, this it it. Well Produce
0	Torn This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story. But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie. Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie.... Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend... much like the more recent movie about King Arthur. Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers...... So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating...
1	On My List of Perfect Movies Everything about this movie is perfect, acting, directing, singing, cinematography. I watch it about every six months. Wouldn't change a thing
1	TURK SAID THAT THAT IS THE BEST MOVIE!!! STAY BLACK!!!! True story about racial problems not just in US but all over the world.Kamal said that that movie should be seen by every one on the world.It is true and nothing but the true.Shout out goes to TURK,Gujo,janc,kolach and my main maN ICHO.!!!!STAY BLACK!!!!
1	Addicted to This Movie I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, and I enjoy watching and discussing his deep, dark movies like &quot;The Beguiled&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven.&quot; But my guilty secret is: whenever &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; show up on cable TV, I get a big goofy grin on my face, drop everything I'm doing, and watch it. I realize this film is an acquired taste, but I *love* it. It's my redneck roots coming out. The overage bikers, Clyde the orangutang, William Smith, crazy old Ruth Gordon, Geoffrey Lewis, Clint crooning with Ray Charles on the soundtrack, even Sondra Locke's singing and acting (which comes off as enjoyably campy in this context)--it's all great! And I love the message of &quot;we rustic rural types are just as interesting as anybody else&quot; (because these *are* my people, as I've said.) I don't think Eastwood has made a more enjoyable movie
1	THIS MOVIE IS BEAUTIFULLY AWFUL. I love this movie. The acting is hilariously bad, the music is great, it's campy, not realistic at all and I wouldn't want it any other way. I've probably seen it 30 times. Every time I see something that makes me laugh. Nine times out of ten the laughing has nothing to do with the scene being shot to be funny. It's totally dated and in the dying metal days of the early nineties. I'd recommend it to musicians totally. Just remember that it's totally terrible in a Rocky Horror kind of way
1	Jane as she should be portrayed This is, in my opinion, the best Jane Eyre of them all. The characters look the part, and the film is beautifully shot and convincingly acted. A great romantic movie
1	The theme song was NOT changed This is in response to the concerns a couple people have raised about the theme song. In the original broadcast run the theme song was sung by studio singers for the first 10 or so episodes only. After that new vocals were recorded by Johnny Mathis and Denise Williams over the same backing tracks and their vocals were heard on all subsequent episodes. That is exactly what happens on these DVDs. After episode 10 we get the Mathis/Williams recording on all the remaining episodes. I have all these early episodes on VHS recorded MANY years ago and the theme song - with both pairs of singers - is exactly the same
1	great ab workout great ab workout with simple instruction; leisa hart was my life saver with her fitmama videos, and now i am feeling so much better than i did after my first two babies,, my abs are getting toned(the extra skin is still there, but that will take me time), but i can see definition that i did not have before. the sexiness of this video, and all the Sexy Series videos, is very real, nothing fake or cheesy, it is very professionally produced and it is getting me the results i want, i highly recommend this workout
0	Lord of the, oh I mean Feet of Flames. This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego
0	Creaky Charles Laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised. But it's lumbering and creaky, with heavy-handed theatrics, typical of the early talky era. I found watching this picture very heavy going
0	2.5 stars Alright. So I had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it. A week or so ago it was playing on Oprah's Oxygen network and I was very happy that I would finally be able to see it. Overall, it was alright. So then it was on again the next day and I couldn't stomach watching it again. It may be called Brown Sugar, but the plot moves slower than molasses. It is way too predictable and sweet, with very little substance. It wasn't even all too interseting the first time around and I couldn't stand seeing it a second time. There's a reason why these movies are on TV, people. No need to purchase the DVD. As soon as I saw it once, I had gotten my dose and wanted no more
1	ALL I EXPECTED I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS DVD FOR SOME TIME-- I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT. THE SOUND IS GREAT AND THE VIDEO IS VERY SHARP. I WOULD RECCOMEND IT
0	One Bad, One Average Episode! As the 3rd and final season quickly comes to an end, I'm left unsurprised that Classic Trek got axed at this season's end. After a long string of poor and uninspiring episodes (where had all the great scriptwriters gone after the first two seasons?) this volume is just the next installment of forgettable drivel. The first episode is just very, very poor with terrible scriptwriting and Spock is inexplicably made out to be some obnoxious old maid with pms. The overall dialogue is very poor and the story is just plain stupid. Why wouldn't a force strong enough to send the Enterprise 1000 light years away just simply destroy the Enterprise right away instead of playing games with the crew is unexplained. Why would the computer have to make replicas of Lee Meriwether specifically for individual crew members without being able to kill at will is another ridiculous failing of the plot. I can safely say that this episode "That Which Survives" is one of the worst 3 episodes in the entire classic trekdom. The second episode is an interesting fable about racial discrimination and intolerance which pricks the conscience and successfully achieves its intention of provoking discomfort among its viewers to look at themselves to see if they are guilty of similar actions themselves. The script is quite good and the acting is good as well and not as bad as the other reviewers have made it out to be. This episode ranks among the better ones of season 3 as well. Overall, we have one horribly bad and one average episode putting this volume under the "give it a miss" category if you are deciding which volumes to collect.
0	Northanger Abbey video review This is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel I've ever seen. The novel was an early work by Jane Austen (published posthumously) so it's not as well crafted as later works. Despite the novel's weaknesses, however, even this video production does not do it justice. The heroine looks like she's on heroin, Maj. Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in "All Creatures Great and Small") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff. I can't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one I chose or whether there was no other choice. The only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships--before I read the book. As they say, "the book was better," and in this case, the old saying couldn't be more true
0	Not Uncut = ****! Gah. Judging from earlier descriptions of this box, I thought it'd be Uncut and billingual like other 4Kids DVDs. It's not the case, so no dice
0	This sucks on ice!!!!!!! This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all!
1	The best out there... There's really not much to say. It is simply the best karate movie ever made so far and by far. Captures the true spirit of what karate movies fans want to see. A must see for every martial arts fanatic
1	Loved the movie. The DVD, not so much The 13th century, Europe. Russia (at this time known as "Rus") is at her weakest, with Mongolian hordes overrunning her lands to the east. What remains of Russia seems ready to fall as the Germanic order of the Teutonic Knights - under the blessings of the Catholic Church - march on to take the land for Rome. Thus this is the setting for "Alexander Nevksy," probably one of the earliest "great hero versus the evil horde" type of movies ever made. It is very clear who you're supposed to love and who you're supposed to hate in this movie. The Russian characters are a grand assortment of loveable characters that are well developed in their own right. On one hand you have Vasily and Gavrilo, two friends vying for the affection of a young girl who enter a pact that whoever proves bravest in battle will win her hand. You also have have Ignat, the friendly armorer who seems to find a bird metaphor for every situation. (and was personally my favorite character) On the other hand, the Teutonic Knights are portrayed as absolute devils. They are a deeply militarized enemy, wearing masks that turn them into a lifeless, faceless enemy. The Grand Master plans to divide Rus among his knights, orders the death of Russian POW's, and in one scene tosses babies into a bonfire. (although in Eisenstein's defense, this wasn't his creation - that was what the Teutonic Knights supposedly did) Likewise, the Russian who betrays the city of Pskov to the Germans is hated by Alexander even more than the Grand Master is. A lot has been discussed about the propaganda nature of the film. Obviously at the time there was tension between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and this surely inspired Eisenstein in his work. The villifying of the Germans as well as the subtle symbolism - the swastika-like shape on the Bishop's hat and the hands hand sticking out of Teutonic helmets as if in a Sieg Heil - can only support this. The film's soundtrack is peppered with patriotic Russian songs calling for the people to rise up against the enemy, defend Russian land, and the usual calls to arms. I do not feel, however, that this detracts at all from the film. Eisenstein was always an artist first and a politician last. The character of Alexander Nevksy is portrayed as dashing, compassionate, brave, and a man-of-the-people because that was how Russian legend portrayed him, and that was how he was emoted through the actor Nikolai Cherkassov. A lot of people have said he is a metaphor for Stalin, but at no point in the film did I think, "Wow, this Nevsky is a lot like Stalin." Nevsky is no more like Stalin than were King David of the Bible, Aragorn in "Lord of the Rings," or Davy Crockett of the Alamo's legend. Some of the more negative reviewers have wondered how Stalin signed the pact with Germany after this film was released - the truth is, the film wasn't released for too long. The Soviet government approved it's making, then removed it from theaters after the non-aggression pact was signed with Germany. Eisenstein was heartbroken because, as stated before, he was always an artist before a politician. It should be noted especially that for a time before this film as made he could not get support in Russia because the communists disapproved of his putting film method over party ideals. And Eisenstein's touch for filmmaking certainly shines through here, as the man who brought us the famous Odessa steps sequence in "The Battleship Potemkin" brings us the the Battle on the Ice sequence. The close shots of hand-to-hand combat are stunning for the time they were filmed. (even if by today's standards it looks like a bunch of guys clanking their shields together) From Nevsky's cavalry charge to the Teutonic shield wall to the crumbling of the ice, you'll find yourself rooting for the Russians at least once or twice. (I especially laughed at the part where Gavrilo grabs a German, spits in his face, and axes him out) Regrettably, the DVD is not too good. There's not even a title menu - when you put the DVD in it goes straight to the movie, and when it's done it goes to the chapter selection. There's no commentary, no original trailer, no cast bios - nothing! This combined with an unrestored audio track and sloppily placed subtitles almost hurts the movie-watching experience. Considering this film is put alongside "Battleship Potemkin" and "Ivan the Terrible" as Eisenstein's greatest films, I think it deserves something better. Maybe in the future Criterion will do what they did for Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" and finally give the film a decent DVD release. Wait...technically they did, but it's in an $80 DVD compilation with "Ivan the Terrible." I suppose if you're willing to bring out the extra bucks, you can be happy at last. All in all, I was not disappointed with this film. If you liked "The Battleship Potemkin," like Russian cinema, or you want to see a good foreign film, (or you want to see what the Russians had before "LOTR: The Two Towers" was made) this I definitely recommend this movie
1	Good movie It's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it doesn't make sense. I bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic TV show. Robert Stack plays the role of Captain Larkin, Hugh O'Brien plays the role of Detective Daniel Myerson, and the beautiful young women was Farrah Fawcett majors who played the role of Karen White. This was your typical airplane movie where it took about 15 minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight 502. After the jumbo jet takes off Captain Larkin gets a radio call from security in New York City. First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box. Next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases. All and all the weasel gives this movie 8 star. As far as Farrah Fawcett Majors goes, she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge.
0	DISAPPOINTMENT OF A LIFE-TIME............... and i guess along, i knew it would be!!! dark shadows 1966-71 is the only dark shadows. period.!!! THERE IS NO.. nor...EVER CAN BE a "revival" of the original...sorry! "revival" was a VERY forgettable attempt by dan curtis (genius) to desparately cling on to an old idea...and i don't blame him, cause it' is my favorite show of all time, but by the 90's, the people and the mood was altogether different fom the 60's...cast and acting not of 66-71 caliber, destined to fail because of that alone...was time to seal the old coffin up 1n 1971...and not be disturbed in '90 or '91 or whenever the heck it was.
1	Classic western with Henry Fonda Wonderful movie. Wanted to buy classic westerns for the nursing home I work at and know they will love it. I watched it and it is great. Thank you
1	I think it was a hoot upon seeing this film in the theatre espeically the part where Candice Bergen tries to woo Burt back with her terrible singing "Better than Ever" I think that is the name of the song ..as always Jill Clayburgh was winning as ever and Burt couldn't been better too. Its a shame Jill's middle age romance flick with Jeffrey Tambor .. "Never Again" got the due it deserved when ti came out. Everybody should check that out, its a hoot too
0	Totally silly Had a huge crush on Deven when I was little. Silly little movie with very little plot. But Brought back found memories.
0	A Charming bit of Camp for a Rainy Afternoon As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to "period" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating. "Northanger Abbey" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works. The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic. Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood. Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance. By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other. (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture. Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance.
0	Avoid this movie-! This has got to be the worst film version of an Austin story I've ever seen. The plot is only tenuously connected with the book; as for the characters, hairstyles & costumes, it should be subtitled "Fellini Does Austin" because it most closely resembles the "Satyricon" IMO. The makeup, costuming, & hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically, but downright grotesque & bizarre - and that's just the lead character, Catherine. The rest are worse. Bad acting, too. Very lame film. The Austin estate should sue BBC for turning out such a turkey & using her name
1	a true artist One of my all time favorite movies. What a great documantary and story of a very complicated man and his effect on such a vast multitude of people of all levels and across the world. And then his families, and the son who tells the story and his journey and questions, you can feel how he's attempting to grapple with all that he discovers, that inspired me. Awesome footage, and quirky interviews with some of the legendary architects of our day. Amazing job for the documentor and how he has put such a complex story together in such a simple style without over-simplifying the stories
1	gladiator dvd a single disc dvd version of a flawless movie.I think the other multi disc versions are unnecessary.This will meet all your needs from this great movie(I call it a movie but it is something else that i cant find the exact word
0	Lackluster Lear Holm is a really terrific actor, but I have a feeling his Lear is probably better served by the stage than by this rather uneven production. For one thing, he really doesn't seem old and frail enough. And the supporting cast doesn't seem particularly well thought out - or is it just the way they're directed. There are some particularly unfortunate moments where we get to see Goneril's twitching, overwrought facial reactions during Lear's lengthy outpourings of invective, and the thing would be hilarious if it weren't so hard to watch (and not in a good way). Lear shouts and everyone shouts back. There is no variation or contrast in the performances. Goneril, in particular, works better as a measured, icy presence, in my opinion. In a television production, we could still see his words cutting her as she keeps her infernal composure. The shouting matches leach the material of a lot of it's dramatic tension. It sometimes seems as if everyone is playing mad here - except, perhaps, for Michael Bryant, who gives faultless line delivery as the Fool. I personally don't think 'Lear' has a chance of working unless as much care is given to the characters closest to him (particularly the daughters) as to Lear himself. The performances need to be developed interdependently, as the characters are interdependent. The music of the piece doesn't come out here. Eventually, it becomes tedious
1	You will not find a better movie version of 1984 Naturally any film media can not place the entire book on the screen with maybe the exception of "Hamlet" (1996). With anything less than a mini-series. Second is it the story or the philosophy that needs to be transmitted? If you are lucky you get both. In this case we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie. An added plus, you could say double plus good, was the portraying the environment as a period piece as described in the book and not as some modern version. The story "1984" was envisioned in 1948. ------------------------------------------- In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith (John Hurt) is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex (Suzanna Hamilton) and with the help of an encouraging inter party member (Richard Burton) even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan. If he gets caught, he will be sent to the "Ministry of Love" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions. --------------------------------------------- This version is a little more graphic than the other two earlier commercial movies. However each movie version brings a different emphasis on this classic story. There is a 2007 version in the works Read a review of the book "1984" by George Orwell. The movie can stand on its own merit, but knowledge of the book will help fill in the gaps and explain the inferences. Better actors could not have been picked. Richard Burton is in his element. Many people think this is happening today.
0	poor adaptation This film is an adaptation of the first book in the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz. I am not really a Dean Koontz fan and have only read a few of his books, but the first 2 in this series were excellent. (I eagerly await the 3rd, which is past due to come out.) This movie was a very boring, poor adaptation in my opinion. Why Dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books I cannot understand. Every movie version of his books has been really bad, this one is no exception. It is dull, which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull. It is no wonder that Dean took his name off this project. That should have been sufficient warning to me. If I could get my money back, I would. Save yours, or better yet, buy the Frankenstein books to enjoy the real story
1	Super Fantastic First Season "David Caruso" # 1 Great cast, great trama. David Caruso is the base of this show, to bad is only one season with David

1	An Excellent Adaptation of an Excellent Novel. David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial). The supporting cast added to the film: Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role. This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction. Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities. There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people. This movie is not completely faithful to the movie. Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel. Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first. I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie). True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character. Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either. As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy. This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced). The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character. (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome", and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.) Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister. This is because of its dependence on situation ethics. Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations. In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie. I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture.
0	Honorably Courageous Has everything: a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special. It makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes, especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board, winning their applaud as well. This is a don't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout...20 star performances! Thank you for sending me a copy. -
1	Nice date night movie! Add one part love story and one part baseball sports flick and you have a great date night movie! This is a wonderful movie to watch. Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner do really great jobs of playing their roles in this movie, but more importantly the storyline is really well done. Costner plays an aging professional pitcher at the end of his career. On the last game he pitches, we see not only what is going on in his mind as a professional pitcher, but also flashbacks of his career over the years and his on again/off again romantic relationship with Preston's character. Definitely worth watchin

1	"You can't escape destiny by running away." Set in the sleepy German town of Bremen, the 1922 German silent film "Nosferatu" is based on the Bram Stoker novel, "Dracula." The film company was unable to obtain the rights to the story, so the names of the Stoker's main characters were changed to avoid legal complications. Bram Stoker's widow sued anyway, and won. All existing copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed by the court handling the case, but since many copies were already in circulation, "Nosferatu" was not lost. In this version of the vampire legend, a young married man, Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is commissioned by the peculiar, repulsive Knock (Alexander Granach) to visit Count Orlock in Transylvania. Count Orlock, apparently wants to buy a house in Bremen, and Knock tells Hutter to travel to Transylvania and make the necessary arrangements with the Count. Knock tells his employee not to pay any attention to the stories of phantoms--it's all nonsense. Hutter, who imagines that he's hit the big time with this commission, travels to Transylvania leaving his wife, Ellen (Greta Schroeder) behind in the care of friends. The trip to Transylvania builds up the suspense as Hutter travels closer and closer to the lair of the Count. Locals at an inn near the castle are full of dread, but Hutter laughs off their horror by blaming the rumours he's been warned about. Even when he's taken by coach to the castle, and dropped some way off because the coachmen fear to go closer, Hutter still proceeds on his journey. The Count's nightmare castle is incredibly atmospheric, but it isn't until Hutter slices his finger while eating dinner that it begins to dawn on him that there's something wrong with this situation. The Count--who doesn't look human--expresses an inordinate amount of interest in Hutter's blood. While Hutter becomes the Count's next meal, his wife back in Bremen experiences horrible nightmares. Meanwhile the Count travels back to Bremen via his coffin in the cargo hold of a ship. The people back in Bremen begin to read newspaper accounts of the plague spreading throughout the region, and after Nosferatu's coffin arrives, residents are found dead in their beds. Naturally the blame falls on the plague--a disease shrouded in mystery. Fearful residents in Bremen stay isolated in their homes, but death still finds them. The element of sexuality always evident in later vampire films also exists in the symbolic surrender of a victim as she presents her neck to Nosferatu while collapsing on her bed. While the film is of great interest to anyone who likes silent film or German Expressionism, it's also fascinating to watch the film and see how the Dracula legend mutated over the years with various versions. Modern versions of Dracula tend to portray him as an accomplished, enigmatic seducer. Nosferatu--on the other hand--looks like a ghoul. F.W. Murnau's film is a masterpiece of the imagination. Nosferatu is a nightmarish figure--a ghoul who rises from his coffin to relentlessly seek his food. The film--devoid of the special effects that dominate today's cinema is gripping, and the scenes of the rats pouring out of the coffin are unforgettable. This Alpha DVD was fair quality given the film's age. It was certainly watchable--one note however, in the subtitles, the original names--Count Dracula, Renfield etc. are used--displacedhuma
0	Big, brash and boring The movie "Extreme Ops" which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it. It is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment. Let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips. This movie has no plot and no characterization. The point appears to be to display some "amazing" stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station. The plot, and I use the term loosely, concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film. They have been hired by a Japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche (the reason why is never really given) so this ragtag group heads for Austria. Why they made the decision to film the shot in the Alps instead of the perfectly good Rocky Mountains is similarly never explained, except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering Serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death. Understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers. He, like the theater audience, seems to find them just as annoying as we do, but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or, even more sensibly, walking out in the middle of the movie, he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them. I usually try to find some good points in a movie I review so it is somewhat balanced, however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say, I guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count? Do yourself a favor and give this a miss. I would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on DVD shelves. There is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull, dumb movie
0	Shallow & self-serving & disappointing. I can only agree with those other viewers who found major gaps & omissions in the "documentary". No mention of Michael Ritchie or John Boorman that I could see. But lots of footage of "hot" & "trendy" folks like Mazursky, Avildsen & Hopper. Even the bit of commentary from Friedkin, Altman & Coppola that might have given this effort some real substance is too slight & superficial to matter. It's stuff you've read or heard a thousand times before. Too bad. They really blew it
0	Not as funny or creative or whimsical as the first two! This Rugrats movie is the worst of the three. Obviously, it was made for promotion and cash more than anything. Nickelodeon didn't consider the plot in the process, so the movie suffers. The plot is complex, yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously, and it has about fifty holes and sub-plots. The movie is too complex for even a 10-year-old to grasp. Since Rugrats is aimed for 3-9 year olds, they won't get it. The main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence [also, Burger King promotion to go with that], and the fact that Spike would now talk. Hah! Spike talked in the episode of the series about Chuckie's dreams. Besides, smelling some disgusting card [that you can smell anytime, not during the movie] isn't fun. The burger smells more like spoiled milk. Anyway, the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dosen't happen. Debbie's well-publicized line and the &quot;That is so wrong!&quot; line, and the Wedgie-dance, are among the stupidest things I have ever seen. Maybe an 8-year-old would disagree. Being 12, I found the humour pretty dumb. So you're aware, I love the series. This movie just wasn't creative at all, it was more of a Thornberry-type flick. And finally, it just isn't whimsical or special in any way. Not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store, if that
1	Review of Orson Welles &quot;It's All True&quot;. A treasure for all Welles' fans. A 32 minute documentary on the failure to complete &quot;It's All True&quot; leads into a full presentation of the beautiful 46 minute B&amp;W SILENT drama documentary titled &quot;Four Men On A Raft&quot;. An excellent modern ( Stereo ) score made up of renditions of the Brazilian music Welles was investigating is dubbed on together with appropriate sound effects ( wind &amp; waves etc ). Despite being on Nitrate film stock stashed in a studio basement for over 40 years its presented in almost perfect condition. A thrill to see what's left and truly sad to think of what might have emerged. Included amongst the snippets of incomplete material is just 3 minutes B&amp;W and 3 minutes colour Rio Carnival footage and a complete 3 minute segment from &quot;My Friend Burrito&quot;
0	HUGELY Disappointed. . . . Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment! It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience. Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.). Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound. Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers. Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance). Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin." I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!! The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of "Holiday," which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp. Here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats! One look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for. I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available. Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!
0	I like Lenny Bruce just fine, but... I always thought of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, which I haven't seen, and the movie producer from WAG THE DOG, which I love. Or RAIN MAN, another fine film. But hey, the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it. Hoffman became Lenny Bruce. Bruce's material was great at times and awful at others. Nowadays, of course, none of it would be shocking. The film shows us Bruce's faults, unedited, presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses. But still, something is missing. Something crucial. I don't know what. I only know this film could have been so much better.

1	I worked up a sweat with this one. This is a good cardio/interval weight training workout. The entire workout is 40 minutes in length. You will need 3 to 5 pound dumbbells for the toning segments (there are 2 or 3 incorporated into the cardio workout). The instructor leads you through some classic aerobic moves then goes into one of the weight training segments in which you will still keep the entire body moving to keep the heart rate up. The kickboxing segment is good too. There is a standing abs with weights segment near the end but she doesn't do any classic floor crunches. This workout had me sweating! It took a couple of times for me to get the routines down, but it seems to be a good cardio workout to add to your fitness DVD rotations.

0	LOL~! If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO
1	We Love It We caught Classical Baby: The Art Show on HBO and my son who was 7 months old at the time was mesmorised by it. The music is beautiful and the visuals are simple and eye catching. I studied art history and am impressed by the unique way of introducing fine art to an infant. My son still loves it now at 15 months and has learned to clap with the characters and he dances when the jazz song comes on. Even my husband enjoys watching it...over and over and over. We have The music show and the dance show too, but the Art Show is our favorite.

1	A glorious sendoff for two fine actors. . . Richard Harris and Oliver Reed inhabit roles worthy of their larger than life talents in Ridley Scott's glorious GLADIATOR. The film has had many reviews, so my two cents are for Harris and Reed. Everything about this marvelous, intimate epic is first-rate, and you must see it if you have not, and on a big screen TV if you can. Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, Caesar for twenty-five years until his murder by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), brings his authority and gentility to bear, never needing to raise his voice to be absolutely In Charge. His Caesar is a man, no more, no less, wondering if, after all these years, what does he truly leave behind? How will History treat him? We get to know him well through his conversations with his daughter Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) as well as his trusted General, the son he wishes he had, Maximus (Russell Crowe). It was close to Harris' last role, and most definitely one of his best. Harris has played kings in the past, but never this realistically. And what can you say about the late Oliver Reed? Along with Harris, he was one of the last of the original Brit hellraisers, and the wear and tear on his face and body make him the perfect Proximo, former gladiator and now trying to make his fortune on other fighters. He doesn't play Proximo, he IS Proximo. You can't help but think of all the great roles Reed played over the years, such as Bill Sykes in OLIVER, Vulcan in BARON MUNCHAUSEN, Otto Von Bismarck in ROYAL FLASH, Athos in THE THREE and THE FOUR MUSKETEERS, HANNIBAL BROOKS in the film of the same name, and of course his performance as Gerald Crich with Glenda Jackson in WOMEN IN LOVE. His loss was a great one for not only the filmmakers of GLADIATOR, but for all of us. Take a look at the 200-minute documentary on Disc Two of this three DVD set and you will find a large portion devoted to Reed, his unfortunate passing only three weeks from the end of filming, and how Scott, the screenwriters and the rest of the crew of GLADIATOR brilliantly completed Reed's wonderful performance. Oliver is probably smiling down, Guinness in hand, saying, "Good on you, mate." GLADIATOR is an epic, to be sure, but ultimately it's about people, and how they survive in a deadly time. Djimon Hounsou as Juba, the spiritual center of the film, Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus, who wants to try to bring Rome back to Marcus Aurelius' dream, Ralf Moeller as Hagen, who comes to respect Maximus as a true leader, and all the cast turn in sterling performances. No one but Ridley Scott could have shepherded this film to as emotionally satisfying an experience as it is. (I think he really should have gotten the Oscar on this one: how could it be voted Best Picture, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects and Russell Crowe Best Actor without acknowledging who pulled it all together and made it work?) See GLADIATOR, check out everything on the three discs, and savor some of the best work from two wonderful actors: Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. We who are about to view salute you. .
1	Very Funny!! This show is so funny, I cannot believe that it didn't last long. The same people that created South Park made this so you know it's gonna be hilarious. It used to come on Comedy Central late at night but I haven't seen it in a while so I decided to buy. It's fun to make fun of the president
0	Great movie but negative I saw it on TV and LOVE that movie. I was so thrilled to get DVD to watch it again BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaire and Hard of Hearing people. Its too sad. It isnt worth it to buy it.
0	This sucks. If you live outside the united states DO NOT BUY!!!! I only bought this dvd so I could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in HD (WMVHD) but since I don't live in the US I could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid DRM bullcrap they encoded the movie with. After weeks of trying different things I finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green. STAY FAR AWAY. Don't buy DRM encoded stuf
1	fulcis blood drenched classic lucio fulcis zombi 2 is in my opinion the greatest zombie movie ever made[dawn of the dead is a close second]and should be in every horror fans collection. people say that its a rip off of romeros films, but doesnt every zombie film take something from night or dawn of the dead. romero basicaly created the whole undead zombie genre. fulcis picture is actually quite original. the setting being in the tropical islands of south america is very effective. the zombies look amazing, much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers. fulcis zombies are rotting, decaying monsters. each one has its own original qualities. the only thing i dont love about the movie is the pacing. it takes like 40 minutes for the film to get going, but once it does get going its a nonstop zombie gorefest. speaking of gore, zombi 2 has plenty of it. the wooden splinter through the eye scene is to this day one of the most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film. if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself in the face and then go buy it immediatly.
0	really sad I'm a huge fan of the show and I'll never buy this. The suits in hollywood have outdone themselves with their chintzy decision to release this best of - rather than season by season. Pathetic
1	The Official Story A difficult period in Argentine history is handeled well in this film. I would recommend this to individuals interested in recent Argentine history. It is not appropriate for anyone under the age of 18
1	American Psycho - the book (1991) and the movie (2000) While I believe that the book is masterfully written, I kept asking myself when I was reading it whether Ellis had a deal with the Devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever. It is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them, see them, almost touch them, they practically scream at you from the pages; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage. I did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book; To admire it, to respect it - yes but to enjoy it... Well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked. She cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire. I liked the film when I saw it first time; I love it now after the second viewing. Surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards. The show belongs to Christian Bale - and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character. Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting. His James Bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly, that your blood would freeze.
1	American Psycho Wow this is one crazy movie. LOL Christian Bale is one nutty dude in this movie. The world of Yuppies. One has to be better than the next, and higher up is where they all strive to be. Who has better looking, more expensive business cards for one example. It's about how money rules who these young men really are in the corporate world. One is so infatuated with himself that he actually gets crazy about it and starts to kill. He kills one acquaintance of his who he really doesn't know, and takes him for another person. Of course Jared Leto is a very nose in the air kind of personality as his friends all are, and gets killed in this movie to, and he is actually the first murder victim. His place is also where Christian's character goes to lure in his victims and where he also hides them. This movie is very good if you like suspense thrillers. It's very well done, and Bale gives a very compelling performance. I call it Yuppieville. 5* rating, it has all the elements of a great thriller.
1	&quot;a true rapper&quot; this dvd is great, this dvd shows the real tupac just like the other reviewers said.. one thing puzzled me this whole time ever since tupac got murdered..is he dead or alive?? i've been putting alot of thought into this.. i came to a conclusion, but i'm not really sure.. my conclusion is that he could still be alive.. after he got shot he was of course rushed to the hospital, then some how he survived the shots, then after that he probably told the FBI or the Cops or whatever that he doesn't want the public to know if he's dead or alive, the reason to this?? i think because if the public knew then of course the gangsters that put this whole murder plot up would know too.. this way the gangsters dunno if he's dead or alive so they cant do anytin anymore about tupac..tupac is probably livin in a paradise sum where in this world far away from the public and the FBI is probably supportin him by giving him food and all that stuff...of course my theory can probably be wrong.. I guess God will only know &amp; the FBI..
0	When Hippies Make Movies I had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while, being a big Sellers fan and a Ringo/Beatles fan - as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie. It is neither. Perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself. The idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both Sellers and Starr to shine, but the script and story (what there was of it) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to. One strange setting after another ends anti-climatically, which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity. It really does seem that they "wrote" it as they went along, if there was anything written at all. And one tired anti-establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed
0	Here's A Puzzler: Who's The Most Loathsome Cast Member? I am being generous in giving this film two stars. I saw a trailer for it, and while it looked intriguing, looks can be deceiving, much like the bulk of this would-be psychological potboiler. I think the photography work and acting deserve a minimum of two stars as both were excellent; the general storyline, however, was drivel. Many reviewers have noted how the film fundamentally makes no sense, and there are parts where I agree wholeheartedly. I don't mind thought-provoking films that leave you wondering what actually happened, but this was mostly in the shallow end from the standpoint of plot construction. It is inconceivable to me how the two female leads (Charlotte Rampling, and Ludivine Sagnier) could tolerate one another; further, it is incomprehensible why Rampling didn't merely leave France when Sagnier started making her life miserable. To believe that Rampling would actually help Sagnier conceal murder is impossible. Yes, I know that the entire character of the daughter is ambiguous by the end, but inasmuch as the character was constructed in Rampling's mind to be a murderess negates charges of cinematic intellectual superiority and holds Rampling's judgment suspect. The entire movie is filled with characters that are excruciating to watch, and the only real reason for a two star rating is that the actors do an outstanding job in their roles. I considered briefly watching the film a second time to make sure I understood all the nuances, but I just hated it too much the first time to give it a second chance. This is one film that looks positively great as a two minute theatrical trailer, but looks positively awful in the light of day as a hulking 103 minute feature. I am very open-minded to unusual, imported, and avant-garde films, but while this movie had touches of all three, I was merely relieved when it was over.
1	If you like movies from Focus Features... If you like movies from Focus Features... you should see this one
0	Jayne wanted to be in a Cary Grant movie at all cost,and the result is a DISASTER Poor Jayne,and the mistakes she made in her short film career.Read any biography about Jayne,and you will have to agree that she should have never accepted this role.Why did she do it? Her life-long competition with Marilyn is the only explanation.MM had been in a Cary Grant movie (Monkey Business),so Jayne just had to do the same.Interestingly enough,in the 2 Cary Grant biographies I read,the film is not even mentionned...Jayne fighting for the attention of Grant with the beautiful model turned actress,Suzy Parker,ends up looking like a female-impersonator,and not a good one.In 1957 Jayne was in a position where she could have refused that tacky role,but instead she sure is in this bomb.Cary Grant was obviouly in it for the money,and his 'I'm so cool,i can't believe it-kind of acting' just doesn't cut it this time.Jayne is the fifth wheel,and just looks like she doesn't belong-No chemistry whatsoever,and everyone in the film looks embarrassed for her.Even her clothes don't even have the feeling of a movie that is supposed to be set in the 1940's.You end up with the feeling that she is an unwelcomed guest on the film-set. Get the DVD,but don't pay more than a buck for it
1	an incredible movie and riveting performance I don't think I've ever rented a movie twice before, but I did rent "Lost" twice. And now, on top of that, I've bought it. For me, that's a lot of money, and a lot of time, to spend on a single movie. In this case, it's more than worth it. I've never seen anything like this movie. It absolutely gripped me. The performance by Dean Cain was so real, so utterly convincing, that it is hard for me to escape the idea that it all actually happened to him, personally. And nothing anyone else did in the movie detracted from that sense that I was watching real events unfold and spiral out of control. I've seen one person shows before but they were always the type where the audience is very aware that it is a performance. You know the type of thing I'm talking about - a venerable actor on a stage - perhaps a stool and a glass of water - a bare card table - a spotlight... This was virtually a one person performance but I didn't even realize it until a day or two after the first time I watched it. The fact that Dean Cain carries the whole movie isn't necessarily obvious because it isn't the point of the movie. The writing, photography, directing and acting (especially the acting) are so layered, nuanced, complex, rich, that it satisfies on every emotional and intellectual level, without additional on-screen characters, or glitzy locations. If this movie strikes a chord in someone, as it did in me, the bleakness of the landscape, the heat, the sun's passage across the sky, the weather changes, all become internalized. Their shifts will become your shifts, and you may feel the connections of the land to the character and events as they become a part of you. You may experience the longings and desires, the sadnesses and fears, that led to the passing moments, and underlie them. And you may not be able to shake them.
1	Brett takes your breath away If I was going to hire an escort he is the one I would want. Penelope and Brett made a great couple. Her father -in- law wanted her to date again after losing her husband on a bucking bull. She has to convince him she has a boyfriend so he quits sending every eligible bachelor in town to her office. Brett shows up and steals the show. He stands up to her father -in-law and wins the respect of the whole town. This is an excellent movie
1	Wilderness Videos are the best Excellent for nice viewing and music. Wilderness has scenery with very few people, excellent music and I have the whole set. Wish they did more
1	WHO NEEDS EXTRAS?? These films stand on their own as great films and great examples of DeMille's unique brand of film making. They don't need 'extra features' to hype them. I was also glad to see the inclusion of 'Four Frightened People' which is quite different from DeMille's usual epic style. The packaging of the set is actually quite good, with single-sided disks and an attractive slip case. The film quality is excellent, considering the fact that these films are over 70 years old. Overall, an outstanding collection at a relatively reasonable price.
0	Ever seen a made at home movie? Nows your chance! ... Now how do you start a review of this kind of movie. Was it a movie? When all of a DOZEN towns people at the gate are waving farewell and sending the would be heros into battle against the (wonderfully computer rendered)dragons doesn't that just somehow seem sad. We six Heros will die so that the dragons won't eat the rest of you! Thats right all 11 of...oh Im sorry didn't see you there, ALL TWELVE of you. I especially like how in this town of twelve+heros there happens to be a traveling deadly martial arts guy, a beautiful girl with a huge crossbow on wheels,(talk about envy) and the robin hood guy, except he's actually from outside the town. So I'm going to stop now before I cry... Yes it was that bad. But as always watch it for the Heck of it and try not to be upset about time lost in a vigilant attempt to make sense out of the dragon storm movie thing..experience thing
1	My favorite movie... I liked the deleted scenes...too bad they took them out from the general audiences. Those scenes made for a more powerful human story...too powerful for civilians, I guess. Excellent movie
0	Legends Of The Dull More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff
1	What experts are saying... It is a big step forward in cutting edge presentation of XC images and educational materials. Combining loads of hot shot footage and a pumping alt.rock soundtrack, both the video and DVD are a perfect presentation or backdrop to a club potluck, overnight trip, or snow dance party. Mostly promotional in nature rather than oriented to technique, that is enough right there to separate this beast from the pack. There is something for just about anyone. The DVD puts them eons ahead of the rest of the XC pack) has tons of extra goodies. A great time-eater on airplanes destined to get your whole area of the plane craning their necks (we know, we tried it :-). - Cross Country Ski World and American Cross Country Skiers Finalist at the Banff Mountain Film Festival and chosen by Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival in "Best of the Fest" tour. "Awesome x-c ski video" - Cross Country Canada "Technically, it's excellent. This video offers great angles and exciting action shots. It gives you an entertaining look at the world of cross country skiing. While skiing converts will love it, it's sure to draw others to the sport." - Lynne Bermel, Ranked 3rd overall Ironman Triathlon World Cup "Action; special effects; artistic, great script; actors .... Sounds like a Hollywood film, but those are what describe xczone's newest action packed X-country skiing movie High Velocity.

1	Hard-bitten fun in glorious black and white An armored car driver (Burt Lancaster) involves himself in a robbery scheme in order to protect both himself and his ex-wife (Yvonne de Carlo), whom he still loves and is now married to a local gangster (Dan Duryea). This is a hard, uncompromising example of film noir, featuring great performances and generating true suspense. The finale of this film is certainly no cop-out and demonstrates that, although films of the 40s were not as graphic as those of today, they were nevertheless often edgier and tougher than most of what comes out now
1	Barbarella's influence on pop-culture...! OK, we all know that Duran Duran got their name from the evil doctor in Barbarella, but Barbarella's influence on pop-culture extends far beyond that! Fans of X-men will notice that when the Great Tyrant captures Pygar, it's identical (practically frame by frame) to the introduction of Callisto and the Morlocks in #169 (X-men fans, pull out your issues, you'll see what I'm talking about). Demolition Man (sorry, I love campy movies), uses many of the elements of the "perfect society" that Barbarella comes from - down to the way they have sex (sitting next to each other with your hands up). There are many others, but I'll let you discover them for yourselves
0	What shark?? I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else
0	possibly the most boring film I have seen... Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces.
1	A delightful comedy For anyone who enjoys good acting, wonderful plot and enjoyable drama this is a must. For those not familiar with Shakespeare this is a fabulous introduction to his comedies
1	Where's Boris? The only reason I knocked off a star is, I was disappointed that in a couple of the movies, Boris is hardly in them. It is really stretching to include them as a collection of his movies. Other than that, the quality is first rate. And I was glad they gave us three discs, instead of one double-sided one, like they have done in the past. I don't know if Universal didn't have more in their library to choose from, but it is painfully obvious in The Black Castle, that Boris and Lon are just making cameos to try market it as a horror movie.
1	A little cheesy, but an all time classic Considering that this movie came out in 1951, the special effects aren't too bad. The acting is alright, and anyone that understands astronomy would understand many things in this movie just aren't possible. Putting that aside, its just a neat old movie, that I had to add to the DVD collection
1	Good Film - For Some People Straight to the point. . . .there are a lot of mixed reviews here, but I would say that this movie is a really good film. Now, i'm in to the quirky, eye-catching, think you can't stomach what is going on with this film kinda movies that have young up and coming actors/actresses in it. Bijou Philips can always be spotted in most of the films, that's how you know it might fit the mold. Anyway, if you aren't into the crazy larry clark films such as "Kids" and "Bully", or any movies such as that, then this probably won't interest you a bit. Oh, and to that reviewer at the top. . . Megzi i believe their name was. . . .Mischa Barton who is great in the film, she doesn't throw on a fake english accent in the movie. . . she really is from London. . . do your research first
0	MASTERFUL NOTHINGNESS Hugh Grant is not too offensive in this role. He is not too cutesy here, and that is something for which to be thankful. In the film Grant's character Michael is engaged to marry Gina, the daughter of an Italian-American mobster (played by James Caan). Michael is a successful auctioneer, and after his engagement to Gina, Gina's father starts using Michael and his connections to the art world to launder money. Soon the FBI is onto the scheme (with Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson as a particularly funny FBI officer). Michael attempts to hide these dealings from Gina (Michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all). When Gina finds out their relationship crumbles. An accident causes even more problems, potentially fatal ones. Overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny. However, you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it
0	Semi-thrilling Thriller This film is so stupid that when different locations in Quebec are shown the captions read "St. Jovite, Canada" or Montreal, Canada" like mentioning Quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for. Angelina Jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately. But I will say that I am happy that she went to see an Expos game while in Montreal... and that she shows us some skin here. The kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is SO ANNOYING!!! Someone needs to steal his John Lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film. One bonus in here is that Marie-Jose Croze is in it albeit briefly. She should have been the lead. She's hotter than Angelina and a better actress (see Munich). This film is also beneath Jean-Hugues Anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun Ethan Hawke any day of the week
1	A Complete Reason For Seeing This Movie Well as all my acquaintances know I'd go to see anything Angelina Jolie appeared in, even if she's in it for only two minutes. Years ago Pauline Kael pronounced that "By now Jane Fonda has become a complete reason for going to the movies" (probably around the time of KLUTE) and it's been apparent for some time that Jolie is the spiritual descendant of Jane Fonda. Think of them, each one the wild, tormented daughter of a great matinee idol with a cleancut image. And neither one with a super great range, but both excellent at what they do: Jane was terrific at denoting "modernity" (to Kael, she carried forth Bette Davis' attitude of purring like a perfectly kept motor), while Jolie is all about being the "wife's worst nightmare." TAKING LIVES is only about one inch deep, and the trailer tells it all, but why not see it anyhow? Either you're in thrall to her giant lips and long arms, her downcast gaze and humungous tattoos (here covered up for the most part)--or you're not. Playing Ileanna Scott, ace FBI profiler in serial murders, isn't much of a stretch for Jolie, for nowadays all you have to do is immerse yourself in a room filled with horrid photos of the killer's crimes and then drift into a trance state where you become the killer; then you wake up gasping like a fish and you shout out, "He uses toothpaste to sedate them!" and everyone goes on the alert for Crest sales. Ileanna's pregnancy is a dilly especially watching the film in early 2006, a time of great world strife during which no magazine cover appears without a mention of Brad and Angelina's forthcoming baby. One of the few shock moments of the movie involve a threat to Ileanna's baby, too gross to go into here. I remember during the filming of this movie the paparazzi caught a tender moment between Jolie, her son Maddox, and her French co-star here Olivier Martinez, best known for dating the Australian pop star Kylie Minogue. Angelina and Olivier took little Maddox to his first ball game, and the next thing you knew, Kylie was flying across to Montreal to pay an impromptu set visit. Well, I suppose Angelina was innocent that time, or as innocent as she gets. She waited until MR AND MRS SMITH to play her full ace of hearts. And Olivier and Kylie are still together as of this writing, hooray
0	What is this complete and utter insanity?!?! What is this complete and utter insanity?!?! This &quot;Set 2&quot; was supposed to include Woody Allen's VERY best &quot;little&quot; film &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;!!! &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; and no &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;?? &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; is an excruciating waste of time. &quot;September&quot;? &quot;Another Woman&quot;? &quot;Alice&quot;? And no &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;? The only picture worth bothering with in this &quot;Set 2&quot; is &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; which is not only one of Allen's most brilliant movies, but just generally brilliant.

0	"I don't want your love unless you know I am repulsive." You'd have to go a long way to find a group of people as unpleasant as those depicted in Christophe Honore's film "Ma Mere." When the film begins, Pierre (Louis Garrel) arrives from boarding school in France to spend the summer with his wealthy parents in Gran Canaria. His father (Philippe Duclos) rattles off some sort of heart-to-heart talk with his son about not really being the sort of person he's become, but Pierre is clearly bored and spoilt, and asks, "can I go now?" Pierre's father returns to France and is abruptly killed in an accident. This leaves Pierre alone with his mother, Helene (Isabelle Huppert) and their two long-suffering servants. There's no period of mourning--although Pierre does discover--and foul--his dad's secret stash of naughty magazines, but then the film settles in to its main theme--the tortured Oedipal relationship that exists between Pierre and Helene. With Pierre's father gone, Helene is clearly unleashed, and together with Pierre, this mother-and-son team begins the odyssey of Pierre's total and complete debauchment. Apparently this isn't difficult to achieve in a city full of holidaymakers and swingers who bravely sport outfits consisting of jockstraps and sequins. Plus Helene spares no time in introducing her son to her friend, Rea (Joana Preiss)--who is, apparently, "the wildest woman" in Helene's wild acquaintance. Helene acts sometimes as a voyeur to her son's debasement, and sometimes as a participant. And it's all rather no-holds barred, revolting stuff. Isabelle Huppert is known for accepting risky roles--consider "The Piano Teacher" for example--a marvelous film that stretched boundaries. "Ma Mere" does more than stretch boundaries--it's an over-the-top kinkfest that sinks rapidly into scene after scene of revolting, purposeless and demeaning encounters. The only joy to be had here is the silly self-righteousness one occasionally indulges in from watching the antics of the filthy rich who have nothing to do all day but engage in depraved activities. Huppert, as always, acts her heart out, but after a while, the film just becomes an exercise in how much the viewer will tolerate. In French with English subtitles--displacedhuma
1	Can't go wrong here! I don't usually like these type of movies, but this is a can't miss...you'll laugh

1	Still Terrific After All These Years #51 on the American Film Institute's Top 100 List, "The Philadelphia Story" is a 1940 comedy that has never lost its popularity. It's the film that rekindled Katherine Hepburn's then-ailing film career, the only movie James Stewart ever won an Oscar for, and a movie that Cary Grant demanded a huge salary for. Surprisingly, the movie is actually funny to this very day. Grant plays C.K. Dexter Haven, a millionaire who has recently separated from his wife Tracy Lord (Hepburn). Now, Tracy is getting remarried and Dexter has hired two people from the gossip magazine Spy to cover the marriage. They are Macaulay Connor (Stewart) and Elizabeth Imbrie. Neither one is happy to be there. Connor is on the verge of quitting his job at the Spy, as he fancies himself a writer and is sick of writing gossip articles. Elizabeth fancies herself a painter and is sick of taking photographs of rich people. Pretty soon, Connor finds himself falling for Tracy as Dexter finds himself falling for her again. Stewart deserved his Oscar as he steals every scene he's in. As I said, the film is still very funny to this day (a rarity, since comedy has changed so much over the years). Anyway, "The Philadelphia Story" is not my favorite film of all time. It think there's plenty of films on the list placed beneath it that are much better, but "The Philadelphia Story" is a charming film that is definitely worth your time. GRADE: A
1	This wasn't Orson Welles' movie. so we don't have the expense or baggage of an original Welles production. He was hired to direct & act. The movie was made to make money & therefore to be done under budget. Welles succeeded & did an excellent, stylish, directing job. In a bit of over-acting he also played the part of creepy Dr. Charles Rankin, formerly Franz Kindler, Nazi war criminal to perfection. This now an old fashioned movie but 1946 was the perfect time for it's subject: Nazis hiding in our midst, such as a small town in Connecticut. This film noir drama may have been made on the cheap but it's stars are first rate. Besides Welles, Edward G. Robinson plays title role, & comes to town under the guise of an antique dealer. He is actually a federal Nazi hunter on the trail of Franz Kindler. Loretta Young is perfecting her role as the idiot wife of Kindler/Dr. Rankin. You might remember her as David Nevin's stupid spouse in The Bishp's Wife several years later. Kindler is embedded as a professor at a private prep school. He seems to be popular with the boys. About half way through the movie, Mr. Wilson has a pretty good idea who Dr. Rankin really is. The climax is to be expected but is still well done, on a subject that still of interest today, facism in America
1	Great, but I missed subtitles in spanish I loved all three chapters of this DVD, as well as Poirot Set 2. The menu is easy to use, the quality of the picture is incredible, etc. The only thing I missed, where the subtitles in Spanish. I speak fluently English, so that was not a problem. So, if you are going to buy this DVD and dont know English, dont buy it, unless you want to learn. And the sound is a little soft, so dont forget to turn the volume down when the DVD is over... Hope this was helpful, and have a great day
0	Not what my daughter expected My 4-year old daughter fell in love with MLP after watching the "Princess Promenade" DVD, so when we saw this, we scooped it up. After watching princess promenade though, watching this was torture. The animation and audio are so poorly done. Every story has a scary character that terrified my 4-year old. The cover resembles the princess promenade disk as far as imagery, but doesn't match the video at all. It seems deceptive. Only after my dissapointment did I note the 1987 production date. If I can return this, I will, because my daughter is too scared to watch it
1	Very well done neo-noir Brian DePalma's Blow Out is a taut thriller that would make Hitchcock proud. The Master of Suspense loved to put his characters in situations where they had to sit by helplessly while events occur beyond their control - the best example of this is Rear Window - and DePalma uses that technique to great effect in the finale of Blow Out. John Travolta plays Jack, a Philadelphia movie sound man who witnesses a car accident one night while he is out recording audio on a bridge. He manages to rescue Sally (Nancy Allen) from the wreckage, but another man - who we later find out is the front-running Presidential candidate McRyan - is left for dead. After reviewing his recording of the accident, Jack determines that this was no accident. He believes that somebody deliberately shot out the tire, but who, and why? When video of the accident surfaces, shot by a man named Karp (Dennis Franz), Jack begins to suspect that both Sally and Karp know more than they're letting on. We also see glimpses of a vigilante psychopath, played by John Lithgow, but who is he, and what are his motives? Jack is determined to find out the truth and unravel the conspiracy, but despite many clues that this wasn't an accident, nobody else seems to want to investigate any further. Jack is also scared that now that the assassins have achieved their goal, anyone who might discover that this was no accident must be eliminated, including himself and Sally, to whom he has developed an attachment. Blow Out is an excellent film that entertains on many levels - plus it takes place in my fair city of Philadelphia. It doesn't dumb anything down for the audience, and the characters manage to act like any of us could see ourselves acting if placed in the same situations. Thumbs up.
0	DVD badly produced I love the sound of Il Divo, but this DVD has very bad sound. There are many times when you cannot hear the singing and when you can the sound quality is not good. This has nothing to do with the singers; it has to do with the sound engineer. This DVD is not worth the cost
1	When the death dies for love! If you are one of those people who still doubts the movie is far from being an artistic ecpression; come to Cocteu's world and please convince by yourself about the veracity of this affirmation. Cocteau adapted the classic Orpheus's myth to the present times, but keeping the essential basis of the myth and its veil's mystery. The poetry literally loads the picture all along the way. Blood of a poet constitutes undoubtedly, the first reference step you must ascend to higher peaks. The surrealist airs are present with all the frenzy of the First Opus; rapture images and seductive illusion, irreverence and disobey; a real captive journey through the Fourth Wall where the dreams and love live. In Orpheus,we will assist to the dramatic premise: Orpheus is obsessed with his wife's death. Heuterbise and Cegeste will his fellows friends and his lamentations and complaints are at last satisfied when he will get the opportunity to get through the frontier between the life and death. She will visit to his beloved wife in clear reference to Dante and Beatrice but he will sign a pact with the underworld's Jury: he will return with his beloved wife with jus one condition: he won't be able to watch her under any pretext or reason. To look behind: this is the most important reflection that feeds not only this fabulous myth but even an apparent far distant work as Faust: to look behind means to be frozen in the time's shadows; and Faust through the decision of becoming to the dead youth will establish his own agreement with Satan. But you have more: When Lot's wife in the Christian mythology looks behind becomes in salt's statue. The memories constitue a real matrix: it's seductive, the enviroment temperature is so warm and seductive that you can be engaged through your entire life. Narcisus comes to our mind when the human being, once has reached the experience's stage, pretendes, mistakenly, to get back to the ancestral origin: the naive innocence. If you decide to get back, you are committed to pay a prize, that's why Orpheus will be murdered in the Hades. Finally in Orpheus' testament we assist to the last farewell of the poet. Inquired by the Great Jury Cocteau answers: "A film is the petrified image of the mind which resurrects the dead acts". He will be punished to live in his final days till the time will come for him to fade. The final encounter with Oediphus literally will invade you of perplexity and cosmic anguish; to be so close and unable to meet one each other. Consider this film not only one of the twenty giants films one any age ever made but one of the ten top French films and perhaps one the three most admired and perfect film in the whole cinema's story. The other two to my mind would be: Carne 's Children of the paradise and Robert Bresson 's A man escapes. When a rose vanishes, the poetry will wait for it and the cycle will start over and over!
1	Smiling is my favorite! This may be my new favorite movie. Will Ferrel is fantastic - the music is wonderful, and I could not stop watching it over and over
1	Critics missed this one... ...and they caused me to pass it up for about 20 years, too. I don't recall many kind words about this movie when originally released. Most reviewers never got past the notorious scene -- you know the one I mean. How sad. Anyway, I took their word for it, movie sucks, don't waste your time. They were so wrong. I finally saw it this weekend. Wow. What an outstanding little thriller. And, I gotta say, a fairly important film. Along with Jacob's Ladder, this seems to anticipate almost every major thriller of the past 15 years. But this one came first, and it may be the stronger film. Rourke is terrific. Seeing this, it's hard not to wonder how different his career might have gone if the critics hadn't chosen to make him their personal whipping boy. I'm not quite ready now to rush out and snag copies of 91/2 Weeks and Wild Orchid, but I'm thinking about it. They were so wrong about this one...maybe these others weren't celluloid vomit, either. Anyway, excellent film. If you're a horror / thriller / mystery fan, and have steered away from this one because you didn't want to see the Cosby kid defiled, I'd encourage you to give it a chance. And if as it unfolds you're thinking, man, this is pretentious trash...well, hang in there. When the story is over you might feel differently. Only complaint. DeNiro's character's name. Come on. As effective as the movie was, it might have been that much more so if they hadn't telegraphed DeNiro's character every step of the way
0	Widescreen Or HD Blueray ? i have to say i love this movie very well done.but after all these years of it's release why? has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on HD or Blueray or a new 2 disc DVD set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie..
0	Feedback from Real Apache "Calculus Wiz" I saw a few scenes and couldn't even continue watching. I like a lot of Charles Bronson's movies. Examples include "Death Hunt," the 80s "Death Wish" series, and "the White Buffalo." But his acting in this movie is unrealistic. He does not act like a real Apache. Bronson seems to overdo it on being "stoic." A relative and I watched a few scenes and just switched channels. Bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real Apache. Paul Newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an Apache-raised white man in "Hombre," which I purchased on Amazon. I do applaud Bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the Apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s. Given the time period, perhaps Bronson should have hired Roman Gabriel instead. He does a realistic job of portraying a Cherokee Indian in the "Undefeated," which was also released around the same time (give or take a couple of years)
1	Simple movie with a profound commentary on relationships A very simple story of a very simple guy who follows his hormones to self-delusion and destruction. He does not make relationships but always keeps women just close enough for his hedonist fulfillment and in the end realizes he is only fooling himself. An admiring friend provides the mirror that helps him see himself as he really is. But can the love of his life ever trust him or has he burned all his bridges too late to recover what really matters? A good lesson on relationships and the price of a promiscuous life.
1	Pretty good. I like having sporting events on DVD vs. VHS. Quality of this one is good. Don't expect too many 'extra' features. If you want a good recap of the 2001 Masters, this will do. The post tournament conference with Tiger is pretty interesting too to watch
1	How Far We've Come When I watched this classic documentary, I couldn't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here, we just wouldn't make it. What it took for Inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls, body-piercing, Hummers and rap music, underneath it all is a heritage that is raw, rich and admirable; and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up. It would be interesting to produce Nanook II and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now.
0	CHILDS PLAY THIS MOVIE WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, AND OLDER PEOPLE WILL NOYT UNDERSTAND IT
0	Ah. I spent to much to rent this I was expecting this movie to be great considering this was the guy from Brotherhood of the Wolf. What a disappointment. I fast forward through alot but still couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. The plot is slow and the actions sequences look like a TV shows
0	Tobe Hooper? Richard Matheson? Masters of Horror? What happened?? One of the most eagerly awaited episodes in Showtime's Masters of Horror series, Dance of the Dead is sadly disappointing. Now granted, it's been a long time since Tobe Hooper, the craftsman behind the legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has done anything remotely spectacular, but the potential was here. Based on a great story by I Am Legend author Richard Matheson (and adapted by his son, Richard Christian Matheson), Dance of the Dead revolves around a Mad Max-ish post-apocalyptic future in which a sheltered girl (Jessica Lowndes) gets in with a bad boy (a beefed-up Jonathan Tucker, from the 2003 re-make of Texas Chainsaw Massacre) who does work for the MC (genre icon Robert Englund) of a club that does some very different performances than you would expect, only to learn a shocking truth about her family. What's the most disappointing here is Hooper's techniques, which are quite a number of quick flashes, edits, and cuts; which were most likely done to give the story a tripped out feel, but only distract the viewer. Not to mention that a majority of the cast are so bad delivering some truly atrocious dialogue (Lowndes and Tucker are the only ones who don't seem to be sleepwalking) that the episode has an overly campy feel to it, and the music (allegedly by Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan) is nu-metal drivel that is as derivative as Hooper's directing techniques. It's a shame, there was a lot of potential here between Hooper, the story, and the cast; but it all got wasted. There's some nice moments here and there (the apocalyptic flashback sequence is very nicely done), but there's not enough here to make Dance of the Dead what it could have been
1	Underrated, Entertaining This is a fine movie that was unfairly panned by critics. There IS some clumsiness to it--the use of flashbacks towards the end doesn't work. They seem as thought they were originally written and filmed to be an earlier part of the narrative and then placed at the end to keep the earlier part of the narrative going at the snappy, exciting pace it is in the final movie, and to add a little of that during the final part, which after Horn is arrested moves at a slower pace. But the movie is still well-made, well-acted, and plenty entertaining. This is a revisionist western that doesn't downplay--well, doesn't downplay excessively--Horn's stature as a killer of men. In the movie, Horn isn't reluctant to fire the first shot, or to keep shooting after a man is down. When one of the cattle rustlers tries to ambush him in town, for example, Horn shoots him and as the man is lying in the mud, probably mortally wounded, Horn unnecessarily shoots him again. In the film, it is this incident that moves the cattlemen who employ him to sell him out. Horn comes off as something of a hapless, easily-manipulated rube in the movie--which it seems very unlikely he could have been and still be as cagey as he was. He's an idiot savant, of sorts, a man remarkably gifted when it comes to killing people, but inept at living in the civilized world. When he learns that he is being accused of killing the Nickell boy, not only does he diligently avoid proclaiming his own innocence, he goes out of his way at his own trial to annoy everyone and cast even more suspicion on himself. We remain sympathetic to Horn, though. When we see him kill, he's always killing men much, much worse than himself. The world is not a worse place for their departure. And he's a helluva shot. We Americans love a great shot
0	Zombies with obfuscate Last night I watched The Gates of Hell, aka City of the Living Dead. It's an Italian horror flick made by Lucio Fulci. Fulci may be best known for his movie Zombie! in which an eyeball is pierced in slow-motion by a sliver of wood, and in which a zombie battles a great white shark (with predictable results). Personally, I find Fulci's movies confusing, boring (aside from a few key scenes), and just plain bad. The cut scenes are abrupt and often make no sense. The "good" scenes in The Gates of Hell include a drill press to Bob's head, and a teenager puking up all her internal organs. The movie is set in New England, which makes the recurring howler monkey sound effects entertaining. And when the dead all awaken, the sound effect is of crinkling cellophane layered over howler monkeys, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Or not
1	A Movie That Echoes The great thing about this movie is just how believable it is. Some people I have shown it to actually thought that Eddie and Cruisers were a real band and that the movie was a docudrama. The characters have faults and failings and are believable, the plot is classic rock'n'roll mythology, the music is original (mostly) and great. John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band provide the real voice of Eddie Wilson and these guys can really rock. This soundtrack rates in my top 50 favorite albums to this day. "What I want is songs that echo" says Eddie, and oh and they do. Both score and movie are still fresh and relevent today. The only Rock'n'Roll movie I like better is Eddie Lives! (out now) together they tell one of the best R'n'R myths ever. Get both NOW!
0	You'll Never Get Rich This is not one of Fred's better efforts, the dancing is so so and Rita Hayworth is among his poorest dance partners. Lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the Astaire/Rogers films. In spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching
0	Perfect My friend and I randomly found this movie at the rental place and were in for a good laugh, so we rented it. We were right when we were looking for a laugh. It was probably the worst acting I've ever seen. Not to mention, completely plotless. The whole idea behind this movie is ridiculous; from the zen-like janitor to the 'popstar's greatest fear: taking a math test. Please buy or rent this movie. Its horrible nature seriously entertains
1	A must-buy for animations lovers! Bought this HD DVD without having seen the film previously, so it was a risk....and I won! I absolutely enjoyed it from begining to end. This film is very under-rated. It's witty, well done and clever...unlike all these stupid animal films that are out now. Buy this film even if you haven't seen it....you won't regret it
1	Exactly what I wanted! This DVD is exactly what I was looking for - a plain "old-fashioned" aerobics class like the ones I attended back in the early 90s when I lost a lot of weight. I put some back on over the last few years and I knew that aerobics would be the thing to help me. All the classes at all the gyms around here are "specialized" - Pilates, yoga, spinning, step, etc. - and not what I wanted. I have seen Gilad's shows on Fit TV but I hated the commercials. So I went looking for a DVD and bought this one. I love it...I was exhausted after it was done but I felt great. It is good for all levels. If you want a great, challenging and motivated aerobic workout, this is the DVD for you
0	Disappointing 70s world war 2 flick. Bad special effects as far as the model work goes. Stupid love story that you have to fast forward through. 60s hairdos on what are supposed to be 1940s women. It's just low budget and lame
1	Hybrid of Sixth sense and Psyco I am really tired of watching "Sixth Sense genre" movies where dead people hang out with alive through out the movie and at the end give obvious creepyness. This movie also has a dead sister hanging out with the other alive one and at the end gives the chilling creepyness. But the originality of this movie is there is no ghosts; the dead sister is only a creepy imagination of psyco sister that is still alive. Actually I enjoyed more watching two sisters taking care of eachother. They are adorable together. I think i am gonna keep this movie.
1	Loved it!! Okay, first off i make it a point to not say anything about the plot, characters, etc. when writing a review on this site. However, let me say this, I watched the whole series, all 21 episodes, in 2 days...and yes i have a full time job! I could not stop watching! I found that this series, not unlike Gantz and a few other that i have recently picked up, was incredible. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who is even remotely into anime. And on a side note, i wounder if one of the animators work on Fooly Cooly (sp?). There were several scene where i noticed similaritie
0	Romeo Must Kiss Juliet Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out. Romeo must kiss Juliet. Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky. A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers
1	FANTASTIC I wasn't sure about this when I ordered it, but it was a HIT! Its a new favorite, and everyone who hears it, raves. Beautiful stage, great music
0	another Van Damme flop purely for fans of crappy Van Damme movies again like I says. really corny from beginning to end. Paul Sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one. Rob Schnider is wasted and WHY THE HELL WAS HE IN THIS I will have no clue. Van Damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in Double Team. with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said HEY!!!! damnit, lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here
0	Way over-rated. I read so much about how "creepy" these Holy Grail of movies were. Luckily, I did not buy the set. I rented it from a local store in Philadelphia. I suggest renting them before making a purchase. I thought these movies were extremely dull, and not in the least frightening. Tombs is the best of the four movies. But, it is really all downhill to the end. Unless you're a Blind Dead fanboy, save your money
0	Not good. Most of the time I love French films. 400 Blows, Breathless, etc. This one caught my eye so I bought it. Waste of $$. Horrible. I never did really get the plot becuase there was not much of one. It was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound. I looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep.
0	The Weasel fails to deliver the goods...bud-dy!! Pauly "The Weasel" Shore stars as himself in this movie about well, himself as he goes threwout the movie, backtracking and tracking forward on how his career went down the drain. He had hit movies, Son-In-Law, Encino Man, In The Army Now, Bio-Dome and Jury Duty. He had a failed Fox TV show and no one liked him anymore. He keeps bugging fellow actors to ask the director for a spot in their movie. Anyway, Shore gets a visit from the "Ghost of Sam Kinison" and Kinison tells him you'll be famous if you're dead. So, Pauly Shore fakes his own death and everyone mourns him, even his # 1 fan Bucky (W. Earl Brown) but soon everyone finds out that he faked his death, so he goes to Celebrity Prison, everyone hates him. In prison, Shore shacks up with Todd Bridges and has encounters with Heidi Fleiss, Tommy Lee and Carlos Gomez. Soon, Shore wants to be known as Pauly Shore the actor, not The Weasel anymore. Funny in a bunch of parts and cameos are scattershot as well...some cameos include Ben Stiller, Tom Sizemore, Michael Madsen, Britney Spears, Bill Maher, Paris and Nicky Hilton, Fred Durst, Andy Dick, Mario Lopez, Carrot Top, Vince Vaughn, Rico Suave, Dustin Diamond, Charlie Sheen, Verne Troyer, Clint Howard, Sean Penn, Kurt Loder, Pamela Anderson, Dr. Dre, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Mewes, Kato Kaelin, Snoop Dogg, Thommy Chong, Ja Rule, Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres, Corey Feldman, Rick Ducommmun, Mark McGrath, Montell Williams, Perry Ferrell, Matt Pinfield, Taylor Negron, Jerry Springer, Adam Sandler (voice only) and many others. Deep down, The Weasel fails to deliver the goods. Pauly Shore Is Dead, dies along the wa
1	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE......this movie This movie is soo good. I think that anyone will love this movie its funny but also heart-warming!

Wonderful movie with many outdore scenes a realy romantic and funny movie , High Quality transfer . Recommended .
0	Man Hating Hollywood. The plot is of this film is built around Hal, Jack Black's character, being a "shallow" beauty obsessed man who one day finds that he is no longer capable of noticing a woman's exterior appearance. Thanks to Tony Robbins and his Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Hal can only see a woman's internal beauty. Is there any legitimacy to such a premise in the first place? Of course not. It's totally ridiculous. One reason is that obesity correlates with mental disorders like depression and obsession-compulsion. The real question is why are these individuals incapable of controlling their own behavior? It certainly isn't due to their being more picturesque "inside" than the rest of us. More importantly, Hal's true self is far deeper rather than the Robbinized one; we see the hypnotized Hal pleasing obese women everywhere while he actively working against his own interests and those of humanity. When he was categorizing women based on their physical fitness and beauty he was practicing a form of selection that allowed us to be among the most successful species on earth. His choice gave him excellent odds of mating with a women who happened to be fertile and also strong enough to survive pregnancy. Contrast this with what happened after he was placed under the conjurer's spell as his reproductive chances immediately evaporated. A porcine woman is one less likely to be fecund, and also one more likely to contract diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, and ovarian cancer along with producing babies who are afflicted with omphalocele and various other birth defects. There's nothing shallow about avoiding obese women. The fact is it's the height of intelligence. Such a predisposition is highly refined and highly recommended. That we have evolved to the point of castigating men who desire healthy mates is merely another indicator of society-wide misandry and our reflexive habit of condemning what is male while fawning over what is female.
1	The truth about Tibet I visited Tibet last summer and experienced the amazing Tibetan people and culture which are rapidly disappearing because of the Chinese. I stayed at a monastery that was slowly being rebuilt after being destroyed and the rinpoche murdered in the 1950s. This beautiful and well-made film documented all that happened to the Tibetans during the Cultural Revolution and made me cry. Why has the west turned its back on Tibet
1	A True Treat for any Doris Day Fan! To finally be able to see this terrific Doris Day variety show in all it's restored color and fantastic sound was something to behold! Day looks and sings like a dream and it's just ashame that she did not do more of these types of shows at this point in her career. The highlights for me were to be able to view the show without the laugh track....you could really enjoy the music....and of course....Day's 70's redition of her big hit Sentimental Journey....don't think she has ever sung better
0	Old Rehashed NFL Films Footage. I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible
1	Liked the movie - hated the packaging! I'm writing this out of frustration. I saw the ending twice on HBO - Free week-end - liked what I saw so decided to order from Amazon. The only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that I have yet to figure out how to open. There is a red plastic piece on the right side. It can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open. I tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked. Those discs are inside for good. I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab. Obviously I'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened. But, as I said before, what I did get to see of the movie, (the last half hour) on hbo . . . I liked. A slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie, was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today
1	A parable about our current relationship to Islam. This is a very entertaining DVD, full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope. In some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current Western civilization of America and Europe and the Islamic world that stretches across Asia. I found it interesting that the film depicts those Christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those Christians that are not tolerant of other's religious beliefs. In this film, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom), his father, and the king of Jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs. The Templar Knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them. In this film, the Muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for Christians. It is a beautiful film, with fascinating architecture, set construction, and weapon and costume design. The battle for the city of Jerusalem is exciting, a dramatic high point, and a critical aspect of the film. Saladin wins the battle and Jerusalem is handed over to the Muslims. Remember that after the death of Jesus, the apostles and disciples spread Christianity into Egypt and Ethiopia, into Rome, France, Spain, England, and Ireland. Also Christianity was spread into Eastern Europe such as Romania, Hungary, Germany. Christianity was spread into present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. Thus the sweep of Islam across the world in around the year 600 brought Islam to Christian communities and cities across the Middle East. It is in response to this growing Islamic power and dominance over the Middle East for 700 years that the Crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film. Yet this is not a Christians hate Muslims who in turn hate Christians type of film. Instead the writers and film-makers imply that the Kingdom of Heaven is attainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other's beliefs about God. This is actually a good message for our day and time - which director Ridley Scott obviously knows
1	Best Waste of a Sunday Afternoon The statement, "He wins a couple of baseball tickets by calling a radio quiz show," misleads the viewer from the best part about this film. He wins Cubs World Series tickets! Therefore, this should be a must see for any Cubs fan! There is also a cameo by one of the Cubs' greats and, not suprisingly, he has a major impact on the film. If there is a better movie about a guy breaking out of prison to see the Cubs in the World Series...I haven't seen it
1	A brilliant and charming comedy The very funny and very true story of a newly-married couple in New York in the late 1960's. Barefoot, which made Robert Redford famous, features the lovely Jane Fonda, as well as french actor Charles Boyer. Extremely funny, very well played, eccentric, original, charming, this is great entertainment
1	not as great as "Charlie Parker" Bird, is a film about the life of jazz great Charlie "the Bird" Parker. Forest Whitaker is doing a great job as Charlie Parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life, except one is lead to believe that "Chan" was his wife (in real life, she wasn't). One negative thing I felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film. I think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance. Another critisism is for a film about Charlie Parker, his talent on improvisation, his creativity could have been, and should have been emphasized more. There is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning, Charlie doesn't even remember the piece, or even the conversation that took place. This is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation. In real life, Charlie Parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time, with some additions here and there, givin it a new mood, new angle, new taste. This could have been shown. However, despite these minor shortcomings, I think the film is a very good one. For Charlie Parker fans, I also strongly suggest the book "Bird Lives" by Ross Russell
0	Don't Be Fooled! I ordered this DVD for my public library's collection along with the English language version. THEY ARE THE SAME DISC! They have the same label numbers. The only difference is a small paper label on the 'Spanish' version's disc declaring that it's dubbed in Spanish. Both the English and Spanish dubbed discs have the exact same content - soundtracks in both languages. Shame on Disney/Buena Vista for this horrible marketing ploy
0	Not the right actors James Spader was supposed to be in the last season of DINER. That would be my only reason for buying it. He is certainly not in this one! So where is he????!!! Are there no Diner videos or DVDs with James Spader?
1	Totally entertaining adventure film This is that typical kind of entertaining 1950s adventure film for all the family, of the kind "they don't make anymore". So if you liked "Elephant Walk" (1954) or "King Solomon's Mines" (1950), this one's most definitely for you! What stands out, IMO, besides the special effects (good for 1954) and scenes dealing the Marabunta invasion, is the great chemistry between sultry, elegant, appealing Eleanor Parker (Joanna Leiningen), at her prettiest and most ladylike, but at the same time, full of passion, ardour and desire to love a real man...and there he is, Charlton Heston (Leiningen), at the peak of his macho-man magnetism with the ladies (my mother told me that she absolutelly swooned over him around the time he made this film). He conveys very well the character's contradictions between his insecurities as man and his desire for this wondrous woman (Parker), chosen to be his wife by his brother. The first part of the film has plenty of scenes that fully display, elegantly in 1950s style, the sexual tension between the characters played by both leads. They make one of the handsomest couples ever paired. William Conrad (of "Jake and the Fatman" fame) is good as the friendly comissioner. Abraham Sofaer plays a similar role than in "Elephant Walk", but this time more sympathetic towards the heroine. Some footage must have been filmed on location, but almost all of the scenes involving the leading players were obviously filmed in Paramount's backlot. Good entertainment! The DVD has no extras though. The print's quality is very good!
0	Good thriller, lousy DVD. Bravo MGM; you've managed yet again to screw up a great movie with a terrible DVD. -It's actually an ORION picture, and I'd hoped that they would've cared more about its appearance, but no such luck. Of my 100+ DVDs, this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image. (Let's hope they're more careful with their upcoming Woody Allen ORION collection.) This is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just don't make them anymore in Hollywood, but it's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on TV. Hackman, Heard, Cassidy and Jones lead a good cast, but in order to see them clearly we desperately need a remastering of this otherwise wonderful movie. Until then, avoid like the plague
0	Defective Recording This recording is simply DEFECTIVE. It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding! This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD. Instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing. And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts.. It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording. Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame. Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash Pirates This is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance. I am immediately returning this to Amazon. This recording should never have been released
1	Battling Alcoholism, Battling a Disability, and Battling an Incarcerated Outlaw's Determined Friends The three parts of the title of this review illustrate the three main conflicts in this classic western. The main conflict is this: An accused criminal (Burdette) is held in jail on the orders of Sheriff Chance (John Wayne). Burdette's many friends attempt several times to spring Burdette from jail. The setting is Texas sometime after the Alamo, and there is a significant Hispanic flavor in this western. The following information is provided for those viewers concerned about the levels of violence in films. This western includes a great deal of shooting, and there are actual scenes of people dead and dying of gunshot wounds. In addition, dynamite is used as a weapon. Dude, an under-sheriff of sorts, had experienced personal tragedies in the recent past, and became a hard-core alcoholic. Burdette's men refer to him with contempt, calling him as a barfly. Throughout this flick, Dude tries to free himself from the bottle. A number of scenes show him trembling from withdrawal symptoms (d. t., delirium tremens). At one point, his hands become so unsteady from the d. t. that he wants to quit his job. In spite of his best efforts, he is about to drink again. But he pours the alcohol back into the bottle, demonstrating at this point both his mastery over alcoholism and the renewed steadiness of his hands, indicative of the passing of his d. t. But the conflict continues. Alcoholism is so insidious. Is Dude actually victorious over his alcoholism, or will he break down and drink again? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it. Stumpy, another under-sheriff of sorts, is assigned to guard the jail. Sheriff Chance does not want Stumpy engaged in gunfights because the latter walks with a limp, and would probably be a liability in a gunfight. But Stumpy resents his subsidiary role, and longs for the action. Will Stumpy remain relegated to the sidelines, or will he see a part of the action? See the film. Burdette's friends resort to several ploys in order to free Burdette from jail. At one point, they capture Dude and use him as a hostage. They want to exchange him for Burdette. Sheriff Chance, having other ideas, agrees to this exchange. Will Dude be safely returned? And will Burdette go free? Again, I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.
1	Film, Acting, Cinematography: Excellent. **I tried to make as little known about plot lines; I will try to be as vague about this film as possible.** Night of the Hunter is one of those rare films that hasn't won any awards and simply got stored as a film that doesn't seem to get much play on television. Yet, NOH passes the test of time in such formidable ways. The storyline and believability of the plot and characters remains strong, as does the top-notch cinematography. Film buffs, photography students, and all those who are fans of camera work, please, do yourself a favor; purchase this film, pop some popcorn and then pop the flick in your player, and prepare yourself to be mesmerized by 93 minutes of a film gem. The scenes get better and better as the movie rolls on, and by the time Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) makes her grand entrance towards the end of the film, you'll probably have already grabbed your handkerchief or shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears, several times over. How can I impart to film buffs and those who enjoy "eye candy," to please become an owner of this treasure? NOH is rarely spoken of when it comes to must-haves in feature movies. When you see the list of talent, it seems like a quiet film that made its debut in the 1950's, not produced to try for blockbuster status. And people didn't recognize the film then, except perhaps that they didn't embrace its style. It's been over half a century since, and NOH is an opportunity for you to turn off your cellphone and let yourself journey with John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl Harper (Sally Jane Bruce) as they depend on each other to survive what happens within their family. By the time Miss Rachel appears, you simply want to cry on her shoulders yourself. Ms. Gish commanded the performance, and seemed to be the only one (along with John) who had any real common sense to understand the unfolding situations. Fortunately, most of the film seemed to take place in the night, and Stanley Cortez took control of his shots and of the lighting in such extraordinary ways. **slight spoiler info, very slight** One scene worth a note: look past the "spider's web" and the other things during the boat ride; put yourself in the mind of a child, and watch them from that kind of perspective, to understand and appreciate these scenes. At first, I was put off by the perspective of some things, but now, I thoroughly enjoy this passage. **end spoils** The interesting thing I observed about NOH is that especially now, this kind of unfolding drama could happen in real life. Nothing in it is beyond reasonable. And that's the chilling thought that coursed through my mind after watching it again. Imagine the point of first contact between John and the preacher. The style of filming is so deep-thought. I also found that Cortez was a photographer, and each scene he composed shows that very foundation. After you watch NOH, place it in an easy-to-get location, because you'll want to watch it again and again. If not for the gorgeously-thought out settings, for perhaps the excellent songs contained within the film. **Some more spoils, about scenes** My favorites: John's first knowledge of Harry Powell when telling a story to Pearl Harry Powell with Willa Harper in the bedroom Willa Harper's river scene the complete dark passage on the river Scene after scene is incredible. You could grab still frames from these and make a beautiful photo album. Someone once wrote that it may have been easier to shoot such scenes with black and white film. Well.... look at the B/W films that have been shot through the decades. Rare are films in which the cinematographer truly displays all of their inner talents. It is simply masterful.
0	Beyond Jaynes opening "leg" shot.... There's not much this film can offer, unless its some cool-looking British sedans and OK to decent character actors. Quyale is utterly wasted. Jayne is, well, Jayne, and the plot is pretty weak. As far as the picture & sound quality, let's not even go there...
0	The Sittaford Mystery I have been an ardent fan of Agatha Christie and Jane Marple for 40 years or more but if this had been the first Christie movie I had seen it would also have been the last. I had a hard time recognizing any of the story in this movie. In fact I stopped and reread the book to be sure I was not completely off track. This is a perfectly good story ruined by overzealous 'modernization' and revision. Geraldine McKewan certainly makes a poor Jane Marple but this is the first one I have seen her in so she might grow on you after a while. I liked the way the story developed and the way it was solved but the story line was completely ruined by the movie. I suppose the movie would have been better if I hadn't been a Jane Marple fan but she was completely extraneous to the story in this one and really didn't appear to contribute to the story at all. I was planning to buy both series of these movies but now I will wait for something else
1	Learn (and Retain!) the Letters as a Toddler My daughter (now 2-1/2) started watching this DVD at 19 months. Within three weeks she not only knew all her upper- and lowercase letters, but she was also obsessed with letters. We have the foam "puzzle piece" letters that go on the floor - she would pick out her favorite and take it to bed at night or have to carry it to the store. She watched the video obsessively for a few months until she'd had enough, and now at nearly three she still knows all her letters in spite of not watching the video anymore. She was similarly enamored with the numbers (Meet the Numbers) and colors (Meet the Colors) and learned each in rapid succession. We went to the eye doctor several weeks ago, and the nurse was astounded that a two-year-old could actually (and easily) read the letters on the eye chart. We've now started our 15 month old watching this video. She is a little young, but has really started talking so she's in the right developmental timeframe. She has nowhere near the attention span and focus of our older daughter, yet she, too, is mesmerised by this video and is becoming obsessed with letters. It is truly amazing. We are giving this DVD as a baby shower gift to everyone we know who is expecting
1	Excellent learning tool for introducing your child to the alphabet I love this video because my 3.5 year old learned his letters (both upper and lower-case) in a week. Sadly, he did not have much exposure to the alphabet prior to this video so we were extremely happy with how quickly he learned. I thought he would get bored with it because it's very repetitious (eg. the letter 'A' is repeated several times with the image flashing in different positions) but they do use that same letter 'A' as a cute character (a rocket that takes off into the sky while saying 'A') which my child loves. Each letter (both upper and lower-case) has a different character (although the upper and lower-case of each letter is similar - for example, letter 'A' and 'a' are both rockets in different environments). The kids voices used for the characters are also endearing to hear over-and-over...which we do watch over-and-over-and-over at my oldest son's request. (My 18 mo old son loves this video also!
1	Memories... If you love the art of dance and this takes you to a blast in the past, then buy this movie for the collection and the history. The story and acting is pretty bad, but the dancing is excellent! If you are looking for something with a good story, keep searching. If you want something entertaining, then this movie is worth it
0	Barbi Doll I don't really like video collections. Live music is so much more interesting. The only exception I can think of to that rule is the video collection by Tom Petty, because he put out the most imaginative and well produced videos. I'd much rather see Shania actually singing and relating to an audience than lipping it to these recorded songs. The only songs on this vid that are live are the last two, and one of them is the boring Rock This Country, one of her weakest songs, a sort of takeoff on Donnie and Marie's I'm A Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Rock and Roll. It's mostly all glitz and glitter. It's mostly just seeing the latest outfit and makeup Shania is wearing. That is superficial. Let's have a real person instead. I don't care about the outfits and the makeup. Seeing her pretend to sing just doesn't cut it. I've heard these exact versions of the songs plenty of times. Come On Over is a fantastic album. She looks great, particularly in her Hawaiian look during the romantic You've Got A Way. I love that song and I love her Hawaiian look. It's all so romantic. I'm not wild about her look when she's wearing slacks or sweat pants. It makes the bottom half of her look so ordinary and boring. She looks so much better in something feminine. Sporty Spice is not a turn on and is not romantic. If you want to turn it up a notch in your music videos, pick up somebody's live performance. It's a whole different feeling. Granted, some of them aren't the greatest, but when they are good, they are a lot better than this. You actually see a real person on stage. Not just Barbi Doll in her newest outfit and makeup
1	Move over James Bond! Great diabolical romp. Lots of fun to watch, John Phillip Law at his best! He's the reason this movie is so charming. Oh, those gorgeous eyes!
1	A witty, humane, thoughtful movie directed by Ernst Lubitsch and written by Samson Raphaelson "As Henry Van Cleve's soul passed over The Great Divide, he realized that it was extremely unlikely that his next stop could be Heaven. And so, philosophically, he presented himself where innumerable people had so often told him to go." Henry (Don Ameche) is greeted courteously by His Excellency (Laird Cregar). "I presume your funeral was satisfactory?" the devil asks. "Well...there was a lot of crying," Henry says, "so I believe everybody had a good time." His Excellency explains that while he will consider Henry's request, there must be good reasons to avoid going Up There. "If you meet our requirements, we'll be only too glad to accommodate you. Would you be kind enough to mention, for instance, some outstanding crime you've committed " "Crime...crime...I'm afraid I can't think of any," Henry says. "But I can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor." Heaven Can Wait is the witty, nostalgic, gentle and surprisingly thoughtful tale of Henry Van Cleve, philanderer, wealthy lay-about and a man far from noble. Under Ernst Lubitsch's direction and with Samson Raphaelson's screenplay, Heaven Can Wait is, as critic Andrew Sarris says, "a hidden masterpiece." His Excellency is intrigued and asks Henry to tell him his story. Henry believes that he can do this only through the women in his life, and, in one linear flashback, he does, starting as a babe in a bassinet. Henry loves women, he loves the pursuit, he loves the pleasures of the chase, the theater, the champagne, the supper clubs. He's spoiled, he's optimistic, he's endlessly inventive in finding ways out of being discovered. He may be innocently selfish, but it's in an almost childlike way. "Oh, Henry," his wife, Martha (Gene Tierney), says to him after being exasperated once too often, "I know your every move. I know your outraged indignation. I know the poor weeping little boy. I know the misunderstood, strong, silent man, the worn-out lion who is too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night." Henry had eloped with Martha the day he met her, under the nose of her fiance, his cousin Albert (Allyn Joslyn), a straight-laced lawyer who believes "marriage isn't a series of thrills. Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people." Henry loves Martha deeply, but can't resist a beautiful face or a well-turned leg. Even as a widower, with a grown son, his old habits remain a part of his character. Yet he is so likeable and charming, Henry Van Cleve rarely hurts anyone. After listening to Henry's story and despite all of Henry's tales of waywardness, His Excellency sends him on his way...but in an elevator going up, not down. He tells Henry, you'll find many people up there who love you and have been waiting for you. They will intercede for you...because despite everything you made people very happy. This is a delightful movie that must have seemed either a relief or irrelevant to it's time. It was made in 1943 and was popular, yet it ostensibly is about nothing much at all. The setting is the 1870's through the start of the 1940's. There is no reference to any outside forces in Henry's life, no World War I, no Great Depression, no rise of fascism, no moral messages. Yet as the movie goes on we meet characters we come to either find amusing or to like, or both, and they disappear from the screen. Their time has passed and, out of sight, they've died while Henry's story continues. I was left, almost without realizing it, feeling optimistic and a little sad. Life does pass us by, and it's best savored by enjoying life without damaging others. Among these characters are Henry's grandfather (Charles Coburn), irascible and secretly (and not so secretly) envious of Henry's outlook on life; Henry's father and mother, played by Louis Calhern and Spring Byington, obliviously stern and clueless and loving and clueless, respectively; and Mabel's parents from Kansas, played by Eugene Pallette and Marjorie Main, who have a great Sunday breakfast scene battling over the comic pages while their butler is the intermediary. Laird Cregar, only 29 when he made this movie and dead little more than a year later, brings great, amused authority to the role of His Excellency. Gene Tierney with her overbite was never more luscious. She did a skilled job as Mabel, loving Henry, understanding of his ways but only willing up to a point to be tolerant. The movie, however, is Don Ameche's. He might have been a bland actor, but he is just about perfect as Henry Van Cleve, well-intentioned, charming, constantly tempted and often frustrated. The movie seems to me to be just about a perfect collaboration between director Lubitsch and writer Raphaelson. They had collaborated earlier on two other great movies, the incomparable Trouble in Paradise and The Shop Around the Corner. Trouble in Paradise has one of the most amusing screenplays you can find, and Lubitsch brought to it all the urbanity and style he was known for. If you could choose only one Lubitsch movie to own, I'd unhesitatingly say to make it Trouble in Paradise. But I think Heaven Can Wait would be second choice. The Criterion DVD features a sumptuous picture transfer with rich color. The extras include a discussion of the film by movie critics Andrew Sarris and Molly Haskell and an interview with Raphaelson by Bill Moyers. The case has an informative brochure with an essay about Lubitsch and the film.
1	Solid entertainment I am glad Best of the Best released on DVD. Even though it is only the 3rd and 4th of the series. The third one is about Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) fights a group of neo-nazi. Best of the Best 4, Tommy is up against Russian mafia who involved in counterfeit. Both movies are quite good for this martial arts action genre. YOu got 2 movies for slightly higher price of a single DVD so it is quite a deal. The picture quality is OK (full screen only) and no 5.1 Dolby Digital, just Dolby 2.0 which is not too bad either. I wish Best of the BEst 1 &amp; 2 will be released soon on DVD. Best of the Best 2 is available on DVD in Canada. For those who can't wait you can find these put up on auctions by Canadians in ebay. I have not received my copy yet so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD
1	Children's Classical Ballet The production looked like a "wet fresco" on the wall of an old basilica that has come to life. The choreography is in close harmony with the musical score. I enjoyed the meadow dancers, aqua dancers, grafitti wallsters and graffiti tree. But, most of all, I enjoyed the "foot-prep" of Peter, The Grandfather, The Cat, The Bird, The Duck and The Wolf.
0	ewhh This movie was just nasty. A couple of descent parts, but other than that it was just low-class nasty... and I got it for free!!!! It wasn't even worth it free
1	Much Better Than the Lester Film!!! From the first frame the Donner version is much better than Lester's. Everything about Donner's Superman 2 is far superior. This is the way Superman 2 ahould have been. I love the turning back the world ending as opposed to the stupid and I mean stupid forget kiss of the original superman 2
1	i love almodovar i can't say it any other way. as one critic once, almodovar doesn't just make movies. he is THE MOVIES! in the light of that, he deserves his own box set. while not a complete box set of his works inclusive, this does feature a pretty good cross section of early works & recent works which confirm that almodovar is indeed a film-making genius in every sense of the word. let me also mention law of desire & matador have never been available in dvd format here in north america prior to the release of this box. it may be a shame, however, for some customers to buy this box set if they already own all the other films in the package aside from those two. on the other hand, this is a great find for many as virtually all of the films here are now very difficult to find & some are currently out of print. fortunately, i only owned bad education & talk to her on dvd before this was released so i didn't lose very much by purchasing the entire box. as far as the plots or storylines go, i think it's fair to say the critics have already done a fantastic job so i will skip the film introductions here. i can also safely assume all of us who are shopping for almodovar films know pretty much what to expect whether it be controversy, heartfelt stories, or madcap humor. if the gods of celluloid cinema would find it in their hearts to release another box set, i would surely appreciate it as there are four more films of almodovar that are either out of print or never released in the states on dvd which would make nice gifts or great collector's items as well. in the meantime, i'm quite sure we are all atleast marginally pleased with the box we've received. the box itself is quite attractive featuring nice artwork all-around, lobby cards including orignal artwork for every film included here, & a bonus disc with special features sure to please every die-hard fan. there are no individual cases for the films here but they are fastened relatively tight by spindles which tend to overlap a bit. i had initally feared that the individual discs could become dislodged in transit causing damage or scratches but everything was in it's proper place. most of the discs themselves don't offer much in the line of extras so they are basically standard issues with the usual subtitles, menu, & chapters. overall the quality of each movie is very good but not great. in fact, some of the discs are only a tad better quality than the old vhs tapes which are hard to find these days as well. but again, i'm just greatful that these films are readily available so the overall picture quality may be jsut small potatoes as far as i'm concerned. nearly all the films here are deserving of the five star rating i've supplied even though i can't say that bad education was my all-time favorite. for some reason or another, i thought this was a bit too dark & i was hoping for a bit more madcap humor or warmth which almodovar is known for. nevertheless, almodovar did an excellent job & gael garcia bernal was phenomenal making bad education a worthy film to view. unfortunately, this one is as unsentimental as it gets. i can hardly wait for the release of his latest film volver on 04/03/07. isn't life grand? my personal rankings talk to her all about my mother women on the verge of a nervous breakdown flower of my secret law of desire live flesh matador bad education
1	Season 2 Having recently gotten into "The Sopranos," after I finished watching the first season; I rushed to get this. Let me just say, I loved the first season; But I love this more. This is a great season of a great show. Not only are the jokes funnier, the acting stronger, the plot twists more surprising, but they also made a couple good decisions. First off, Livia Soprano (Tony's mom) was a big part of the first season (and frankly, she wore out her welcome several times). Here, her character is decreased and when she does appear...It's not bad. Anyway...Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his family, including wife Carmela (Edie Falco), daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and son A.J. return with a whole array of family and business issues. Tony is still seeing Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), his shrink. Christopher (Michael Imperioli) tries acting. Adreanna's (Drea De Matteo) uncle Richie shows up in the beginning of the season, becoming a main character and ends up dating Tony's sister Janice; Despite a personal-and-business feud between them. Oh, and there's a rat in the family. I don't want to say too much, because I think with any show, it's better to watch each episode without any real knowledge of what's going to happen. But, rest assured, if you like the 1st season. You'll definitely like this one. Here's the list of episodes and a few comments: 1. Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office-The first episode of the 2nd season picks up basically where the first one left off. Tony's uncle Junior is in jail, which makes Tony new boss, he's severed ties with his mother, and his psychiatrist won't see him. In this episode his sister Janice shows up. 2. Do Not Resuscitate-Nothing really significant occurs in this episode, but it is pretty entertaining. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. 3. Toodle F**king Oo-This episode is pretty funny, except my interest in Tony's mother in the hospital goes down everytime there's a scene that takes place there. 4. Commendator-In this episode, Tony goes to Italy without Carmela or the kids for business purposes and Pussy's wife wants to divorce him. The episode is written by series creator, David Chase...So, it's one of the better episodes even though it's different from the other ones. 5. Big Girls Don't Cry-This is the most entertaining and cool episode so far and features Christopher joining an acting class and letting out some of his inner demons as well as Tony returning to therapy. 6. The Happy Wanderer-This episode has an array of cool things. Guest appearances by Frank Sinatra Jr. and Robert Patrick; And you hear the song "Down" by Stone Temple Pilots played in the background in one scene. The season is getting a lot better later on, because this is a really great episode. 7. D Girl-This episode is extremely close to perfect. Guest appearances by Jon Favreau, Janeane Garofalo, and Sandra Bernhard. 8. Full Leather Jacket-A surprising (and funny...kinda) ending makes this episode one of the best this season. 9. From Where to Eternity-This episode is written by Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, and deals with what happened in the previous episode. Very dramatic, very funny, and very entertaining. The classic R&B score works really well. 10. Bust Out-In this episode, Carmela comes close to having an affair with a painter. It's an entertaining episode. 11. House Arrest-This episode is very funny and you also get to see a sensitive side to Uncle Junior. 12. The Knight in White Satin Armor-This episode wasn't my favorite, but the last 20 minutes were great. One of the main characters may or may not die in this episode. 13. Funhouse-When an episode of a show is written by it's creator (especially when it's the season finale) it's usually really good. This is one of the strongest episodes. GRADE: A
1	The ultimate battle between good and evil!!! The Transformers have always been a favorite of mine, and to finally be able to own this movie is awesome!!! As a fan I could watch this hundreds of times and still get caught up in the current emotion of the scene. I would give this ten stars, but it only goes to five!! This is a great deal with all of the bonus features!!
0	I think Robert Stack wandered in from another movie This is not a "typical" Fuller effort. He goes for the Cinemascope view of post War Japan, pictures of blossoms and Mt Fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer, Robert Stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along - and his full range of expressions from A to B. The drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as I imagined Ms Yamaguchi's desire drooped at the thought of giving Mr Stack a massage. Boy what a let down. Mr Ryan does his professional best but hey, he's always a trooper worth watching. Mr Godard allegedly thought this was Fuller's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time. No no Nannette? No no noir
0	TERRIBLE..TERRIBLE BORING MOVIE! I am a lover of Japanese movies. I even purchased a masterpiece (Sadakan No. 8) for $50 for a VHS. I have a huge collection of Japanese jems. So I know what I'm talking about. Heck I'm even Japanese myself :-) But let me tell you--MABOROSI must mean MAJOR BORING..This movie can be condensed easily into 30 minutes and probably be still too boring. Yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die...please stop you are too young to die..but grandma leaves anyway and Yumiko dreams about this repeatedly. Yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide. She mops throughout the movie from start to finish. She wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect. A totally unrealistic movie; in real life, Yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of. (her husband was some kind of laborer.) THE MOVIE IS DREADFULLY BORING. BORING. BORING. BORING. It goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot. It goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy... Masterpiece--HOW ON EARTH????? It's another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good. Now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy-please by all means purchase this. It's hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well! I'm not exaggerating. If you decide to purchase this BORING movie, and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated, well, I warned you. Thank you
1	A Groundbreaking Thriller!!! Jack Nicholson goes crazy better than anyone else on screen. The film is a bit dated, but enjoyable none the less
0	Moon River....this movie is all wet! Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat.
0	A waste of time. Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this
0	Mindless Black Revenge Drama, Boring Racist cop John Shaft (again the over rated Sam Jackson) thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people, blow up the streets of New York and shoot anyone he wants to, well, this movie is a bit of something absurd. The direction is terrible, the action sequences are cliched and the "black brother" message doesn't really make sense because it falls flat by endorsing to kill all "honkeys". I would avoid this mess unless of course you are someone who feels that violence is necessary against innocent civilians.....
1	Old Laughs You may have forgotten just how funny this one is. It's great for those times when you just want to smile, but aren't sure what to watch. Plus, you have the added benefit that most young people haven't seen it yet! Nothing too objectionable in it, so that's good too.
1	A Summer Place DVD arrived quickly and it great shape will make a lovely addition to my keepsake collection
1	From the mouth of a 5 year-old My son is obsessed with this movie, as he is with everything Scooby. But he says he give it 4 stars instead of 5 because in this one the gang spends half the movie not being friends (but then they do make up)
0	Too many unanswered questions... I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it
0	Does not work! The DVD does not work in Ireland so it is absolutely useless!! I should have been made aware of this when I was purchasing the product. I would like to be refunded in full for the three DVDs I have purchased: My Fair Lady, Paris when it Sizzles and Breakfast at Tiffanys (purchased at the same time) Also the packaging costs were not displayed until i had entered my credit card number and were much too expensive. Overall i am extremely disappointed with my experience and I expect to be compensated for this
0	Well shot, terrible ideas First off, I found this movie finely played and edited. But I was truly shocked at Lester's pro-Castro ideology. We're en 1979 for Christ sakes ! Can't we have some true historical facts ? Didn't you hear about the trials, the political prisoners, the crowds of people trying to escape the totalitarian regime ? No, the bad guys here are Batista people, potrayed like mere pigs. I'm glad this movie didn't catch people's attention, it's nothing but propaganda. And like a previous reviewer said, it must be Castro's perefered movie, well done Lester, accomplice of the Castro's killings
0	What a stifferoo! Dreadful - even the actors looked embarrassed. The only part worth seeing was the swearing autoteller. Other directors of dogs like this have the sense to save themselves shame by hiding behind the Alan Smithee psuedonym - what a pity Mr. King didn't. Just awful
0	MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE SEEMS STUCK IN REVERSE! Among Stephen King's famous quotes is the one about why he doesn't direct his own films. His answer, not surprisingly, is, "Have you ever seen 'MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE'"? That just about says it all. The film has terrific material to work with, but it is static and very poorly executed. When I watch this film I always think, "Why didn't he do this or that?" and "Why are all the actors just standing around"? Fortunately, King is a better writer than director. IMPRESSIONS OF A YOUNGER KING FAN: My teenage daughter has read most of King's novels and agrees with King's assessment of this film. Her favorite film is "Creepshow" which I introduced to her when she was too young and scared her with the famous line, "Where's my cake?" That line still works. BETTER STEPHEN KING FILMS TO WATCH: To see better cinematic examples of Stephen King's storywriting, check out "The Shining", "Misery", "Creepshow" or "Carrie". None of these films was directed by King, but each film better represents King's work on the big screen. In "Creepshow" he even stars in one of the sequences "The Death of Jordy Verrill", and he does a respectable job of interpreting his own work. OUT OF FAIRNESS: There are worse films out there, but Stephen King did not write the novels or screenplays for them. This film, though not a good representation of King's work, is watchable for some and is not terrible. Unlike many of King's other films, this cannot be classified as good, however
0	Charisma is capable of far better acting Drivel. I'm a 40 year old woman and I like "chick flicks" when they are good. I loved "You've got mail". But this? This was just drivel. Badly written, formulaic boring plot, and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends. You want to watch funny interactions between the sexes, watch Friends or BBC's coupling. You want to watch Charisma ACT? Go rent Buffy and Angel. Watch Veronica Mars. Charisma did her best to be Mary TYler Moore, but in the end, she was an unbelievable character who I'm supposed to believe as a wallflower. Yeah. Right
0	The Foyle Hunk I'd like to give this period tv series higher marks; I love Michael Kitchen's wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, and Honeysuckle Weeks as Women's Auxiliary driver "Sam" Stewart is delightful. Their interplay really makes the show. It just isn't enough (for me) to compensate for many major shortcomings. As other reviewers have pointed out, the show weaves contemporary (early WWII) social issues into its plots. Not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be EXTREMELY off-putting. Why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area? Apparently it's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars?!? Worst of all is Foyle's out-of-character sermonizing, which sometimes takes weird turns, as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he'll be on his case when the war's over. Not only does this make no sense in view of Foyle's previous instructions, but I interpret the capitalist villain's bemused expression to mean "Thanks for the tip, copper, I'll be getting off THIS flight in extradition-free Ireland!!!" D'oh! Well, carry on, inspector! The show's designers are also a bit careless with PHYSICAL period details. Usually this is pretty minor stuff, but at least once produces a howler. In the FIFTY_SHIPS episode, after a lengthy sermon on the CRUCIAL importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of U.S. military equipment ('even though it's just moldy American rubbish'), we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a U.S.-made C-47 (cutting edge in 1940) in RAF colours!!! As other reviewers have also pointed out, the stories are relentlessly pc. I have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services; I'm sure that's true of all armies. But after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman, prejudiced patriot, and cowardly bourgeois I switched to Sherlock! The unforgivable sin, however, is the cheesy plotting. It's not just that it's formulaic and predictable, but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow Foyle to 'detect.' Do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until Foyle pulled a Columbo with the tea bag? Is there a Gosford Park near this police station? In conclusion, there're FAR superior Brit and, yes, U.S. detective shows out there. If you like it pc try Morse; if you're into period try Poirot, Wimsey, or the Hickson Marple. Leave Foyle unless you're desperate
1	salute the king of new york With this concert, he proved he was the King of New York. For a rapper to sell out Madison Square Garden by himself, as quick as he did, was no real surprise when we all know Jay-Z's achievements over the years. This concert was the culmination of an incredible career. 'The Black Album' delivered what Jay-Z promised, he was back to his very best, and his incredible performance on this DVD showcases that. The live performance is very well mixed in with studio shots of Jay-Z at work with producers working on songs. It gives the viewer and understanding of what has to happen for a song to be completed, and it also showed Jay's unique way of delivering his rhymes, without any paper, just remembering them and spitting them on the fly. The concert was unbelievable. Jay-Z trotted out star after star to help him with all his collabo's over the years. The only time this let him down was when he had Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek and Freeway on stage at the same time. All 3 rappers detracted from Jay-Z being the main show, but this is how i felt on 'The Dynasty' so I guess it wasn't going to change. The night finished with Jay-Z performing Encore and December 4th so a crowd delerious with joy and satisfaction. After this performance, Jay-Z will go down in rap history as one of the best to ever grace the microphone. Definitely buy this, it's well worth it.

1	Awfully Funny After accusing each other of infidelity, Jerry and Lucy impulsively decide to divorce. They have to wait until the divorce is final, but in the meantime each begins to date other people. Lucy dates an oilman from Oklahoma and Jerry has great fun doing everything he can to ruin the romance including telling her how much she'll like Oklahoma's night life compared to New York's. Lucy gets her revenge by pretending to be his sister when Jerry dates a rich socialite. When they're not trying to sabotage each other's relationships, Jerry and Lucy are fighting over the custody of their dog, Mr. Smith. "The Awful Truth" is one of the funniest screwball comedies that I've ever seen. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are a delight as the feuding couple who truly deserve each other. There are many laugh out loud scenes in this movie - including when Jerry thinks Lucy is having an affair with her voice teacher and bursts in on what he thinks is the two of them; an off-screen fight between Jerry and said voice teacher; Jerry's date with a nightclub singer, and many many more. There are plenty of double entendres and sight gags to keep you laughing. From the very beginning you know how the movie is going to end, but it's a lot of fun getting to that ending. "The Awful Truth" is awfully funny.
1	BEST BIGFOOT MOVIE TO DATE Even though made as a comedy, this is the best portrayal of Bigfoot Hollywood has ever come up with. Thanks to the very convincing make-up talents of Rick Baker. The master of the trade. I've been waiting for, and requesting this one for years. Family entertainment delight. FINALLY
1	What a treat When our adult children were small they loved this film. Now we have an eight year old who is extremely physically handicapped but is mentally alert. He absolutely loves this film. When I hold it up to see if he wants to watch it and he gets the biggest smile. It is a film that children never get tired of and we adults love it too. I had actually forgotten about this movie until I ran across it one day and I immediately ordered it. I am so glad it finally came out on DVD.
1	Perfect Truffaut Package. All of the Antoine Doinel films are here in this excellent dvd box set. The films are packaged in their best possible presentation thanks to Criterion, and the special features are all one could ask for including Truffaut's first short film. Not only a great collection of films (THE 400 BLOWS and STOLEN KISSES are among the best) but one of the best titles in the Criterion Collection. A Must own
1	the best Man, this DVD is so good. The band is awesome. That's no comment for Chick Corea..
0	Could have been better Gay guy tells straight guy that gay guys can get any girl. Straight guy tests this out and supposedly, fiasco occurs. Well there was a fiasco: the acting, the script and the lead actor (guy who plays straight) because he painfully upstaged the rest of the cast. He does a good job in a bad script. The guy that plays his roommate (the straight guy's roommate) is a horrible actor. He made me flinch everytime he delivered his lines. The rest of the cast was 'high school production-esque'-- I especially liked the trampy girlfriend. She kind of reminded me of a non drag version of Devine. I don't remember the names of the characters because most of this movie is forgettable. Some of the scenes were funny when they weren't supposed to be and others were awkward when they were supposed to be funny. There is a little girl (straighty's sister) that also has some funny lines and fairly good delivery. If you want poor production, bad scripts and bad acting, you can either rent America's Funniest Home Videos or this movie. Both have some decent moments, but neither of them are worth buying on DVD
1	RAINBOW featurung RONNIE JAMES DIO Who was Rainbow and are they any good? Rainbow was birthed out of famed guitarist Ritchie Blackmore's departure from supergroup DEEP PURPLE.His impression of lead vocalist,Ronnie James Dio's group( ELF who was opening up for DEEP PURPLE), led to his proposition into forming RAINBOW.This group,RAINBOW, established DIO as the premier heavy metal vocalist that would later define metal as we know it.It would prove to be part of DIO's path of successful stepping stones before joining BLACK SABBATH prior to his own highly successful solo career in the 1980's. The 1970's:There wasn't the sound equipment available that we have today nor did the avereage individual have the means to play any form of music videos.So when it was filmed,it was never intended for a professional release.Thankfully,it was filmed and it is great! This is an era that wasn't about all the show,,, IT'S ABOUT THE MUSIC ! It sounds as good as the records did from that era and with an opened mind you will see that this is a true gem to be relished. HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID ! !
1	Velcro. Nice. I really liked this one, an improvement over the first X-men which was also good. There was plenty of stuff exploding, lots of flying, lots of fighting, snappy dialog, with the characters being just developed enough to fulfill their roles without slowing the pace. Patrick Stewart shined as always. The sound design was not exactly Murch territory but it was basically perfect for an action-blockbuster type of movie, with great balance, and not an over-reliance on dramatic 'over the head' or ping-pong effects. Now for a couple of small cons: a tiny gripe is Magneto's costume, it was incredibly cheap and dumb looking. They did kind of 'save' this with a line from Pyro, but still... The most interesting opportunity for any actual drama was the subplot about Striker's son, especially as he controlled the illusory little girl, and then he was just gone. I went back and looked for more shots and they just left that story in the dirt. Really , probably another thirty seconds on the character and I wouldn't even complain given that this was an action flick. Overall though it was really enjoyable. 'A thrill a minute'. Best line: 'Velcro. Nice.'
0	For Jarheads I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead. I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military. For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested. As someone else mentione. I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..
1	Almost Solid Gold To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol! That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on. The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in "Harvey" and "Arsenic and Old Lace," to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film. One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie. This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career). But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman. Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon! (Note: Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.) This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy. And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a "dumb blonde"! She only did that in "Born Yesterday.
0	empire of the wolves So whose brilliant idea was it substitute Jean Reno's trademark french accent with a bloody yank's? What a total let down, the entire appeal of this bloke is his gruff, natural french accent and to trade it off with a yankie accent is beyond comprehension. Idiots. Ray Duncan Australia.
1	great! I'm married to a spanish man and have always wanted to learn the dances from his culture. Granted, the dances on this dvd are a lot more americanized than the actual thing at times, but i can definitely keep up now. Each dance is broken down and repeated a lot of times--they teach the men's steps 3 or 4 times, as well as the women's steps, and then both men and women together, then they finally do it quickly to put it all together. So if you're someone who needs to see it a lot before you get it, this is perfect. The only funny thing is that the teachers speak with this british-like accent, which i wouldn't expect for a latin theme, but hey it's still great. The music is even good. And it's definitely a workout. This was worth my money, most definitely
0	Really Two-and-one-half stars on normal scale, but Dir. Mark Lester screws this one up! Take Eugene Levy (Puhleez!), his former Canadian (R.I.P.)SC-TV alum John Candy and add 'Commando's' Dir., Harold Ramis and (!) James Keach (!!) to the writers and what do you have? An only moderately funny John Candy movie! There are some great bits in here - but this movie is the greatest waste of space (make that talent!) since Greenland! Robert Loggia and Meg Ryan are wasted in stupid stereo- typical roles. And Levy with Ryan?! About as bad as Billy (Clipper-fan, his only redeeming quality!) Crystal with Ryan! Or Tom Hanks! Lester did better here than with 'Commando',but is that really saying much!?
1	i would do business with this again came in good time and i a1 conditio
1	David Attenborough is unbelievable This is a disc that contains six movies on it, each with a theme that revolves around one season in the Antarctic and what happens during that time to the continent and the animals and birds that live in or on it. These movies are so realistically and clearly presented that you need a blanket to curl up in while watching Attenborough walk around in freezing Antarctica filming all kinds of creatures - on land, under water and in the air. The guy (and his camera team) are simply unbelievable. They spent three years filming these scenes. As anyone who has experienced anything colder than freezing can attest to, spending even a few minutes outside on a cold day can be daunting. But to spend all your time in temperatures of 74 below, with winds of upto 120 miles per hour - that is either sheer determination or insanity, or maybe a mix of both. Whatever, the result is startling movies that are breathtaking, superbly shot, and extremely well-presented. I have watched most of Attenborough's films and they are all top-notch. He is definitely the world's most amazing wildlife and nature filmmaker ever. He presents everything as is, without sentimentality, but with a clear sense of wonder at all the marvels he is depicting. When he speaks and shows you scenes, you feel you are there. Hands down one of the top three wildlife films I have ever seen. Highly recommended
1	Completely Awesome! The Golden Suns are here, finally! This is an amazing set, and better than I remembered it as a kid! Compelling stories, good animation, great voice acting. Tons of fun for any age. Wish they made cartoons today as good as they did back in the "day". The Temple of the Golden Suns completely got me hooked on Duck Tales as a kid, and got me into reading the Carl Barks/Don Rosa comic books. I remembered it from, gosh, when I saw it in 87', so it must have made a big impression! Go get it today - you won't be disappointed! Because life IS like a hurricane
1	I Can't believe we missed this show the first time around! This show has it all, I can only hope this continues fall the remaining seasons. I never thought it was this deep, how entertaining can a show about a high school student killing vampires be? Damn Entertaining, that is what!
1	Quite the little head trip. Swimming Pool explores some very interesting themes: the differences between youth and age, innocence, sexual awakening, motherhood, solitude, and voyeurism, among others. The plot is deceivingly simple. Sarah, a writer, is staying at her editor's house in France so she can work on her next novel. She's had a great deal of success as a mystery writer, but seems to have hit a wall. She doesn't want to do another mystery, but she doesn't know what else to write about. Enter Julie, the editor's daughter. She breezes into the house one night like a force of nature. Her first order of business? She uncovers the swimming pool in the backyard. It's full of leaves, but this doesn't stop her from peeling her clothes off and swimming in it. She also takes to sunbathing topless and having sex in the living room on a nightly basis, with whatever men she can talk into coming home with her. Sarah is disgusted by all of this behavior at first, but as time goes by, she becomes captivated by it. She creates a 'Julie' file on her computer, and she starts writing again. But there's a lot more going on under the surface. What is fantasy? What is reality? Is the movie just a product of Sarah's imagination? Are Sarah and Julie linked in some way, and if so, how? What the hell is going on? Francois Orzon, in an interview with Indie Wire, had this to say: "I don't want to give you the key. I myself have an opinion about it, obviously -- but I wanted to keep the film open-ended and let every viewer imagine what he wishes. It's a movie that gives viewers the freedom to make their own film." So essentially the meaning of the movie is left for you to decipher. I'm not sure how I feel about that. It doesn't really seem like good storytelling, and it would be disastrous if every director in the world started doing this. But Orzon isn't every director, and Swimming Pool isn't an ordinary movie. I found myself thinking about it a lot once I had ejected the DVD, turning the facts over in my mind and trying to make them fit into some kind of coherent storyline. It's strangely satisfying to do this, and I seriously suggest that you watch the film so you can do the same. My only complaint is that the DVD features were sparse - just a trailer and a few deleted scenes that didn't seem to add much. There wasn't any director's commentary, which irked me to no end. I would have loved to hear Orzon's take on the rather bizarre series of events, but no such luck. Oh, and should you pick up the unrated version, be prepared for a lot of Ludivine Sagnier's breasts. They should have been given second billing for all their screen time
0	I haven't recieved this item yet I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive
1	4 not a 5 This film looked and sounded great. It was an Angelina Jolie movie but it just wasn't what I expected. I come from the time were Lara Croft was controlled by your fingure tips so I don't think they captured my Lara Croft Tomb Raider. It is still a film I have seen in standard and own in HD. The HD looks great. The film itself just didn't do it for me. They really didn't capture the essence of Tomb Raider
0	Strangely sterile, a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity. This is a movie that got universally bad reviews. It helped knowing that going in because my expectations were very low. Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I was not disappointed in her performance. Despite a thin plot and cheesy effects, Angelina delivered her lines with class and finesse. Unfortunately even her talent cannot overide an overall lack of plot and unbelievable situations. The film grew tiresome very quickly. On a Jungian level this film portrays a strange sterility. The first scene is Lara upside down, in the middle of a training exercise set by her computer nerd flunkie and her all-purpose butler. This opening segment defined the problem for the film--someone who is not grounded and unconscious. Lara raids tombs and fights bad guys to no real purpose--except perhaps to pit her skills against someone else. This cycle repeats endlessly, as do video games, which create a feeling of accomplishment where there is none, sterile endeavors with no learning and no personal or interpersonal gain. The individual does not develop--just the skills. Lara steals the ancient wealth of civilizations from tombs, co-opting heritage and treasure for the love of the game. This disregard for cultural artifacts except as an exercise is indicative of lack of depth and insight. In one moment in the movie, there is a clear symbol of the futility of this lifestyle--Lara puts everything aside to retrieve a memento of her dead father. But then she reverts to form. In addition there is no mention of her mother--what happened to her and why is this not a loss? Obviously this is such a deficit it cannot be referred to except obliquely by one scene where an enormous statue of a woman is destroyed, and by the total lack of other women in the film. Overall a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity
0	No, SendThem Sand; No, You Can't Take It With You! Very disappointed. The famous routines I was looking for are not on this set. I didn't like these routines. Look for mine on Ebay cheap
0	Best seen with low expectations A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original. With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show cliché) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too. A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself
1	The Life of Tito The biography of Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito could have been presented in many different ways, taking into account different literary portrayals of this truly great statesman of the 20th century. There is no doubt that Tito had a multitude of enemies, but the number of his friends was even greater. I was a child when Tito died, but I witnessed the truly heartwrenching outpour of grief among common people of Yugoslavia - from Slovenia in the Northwest, to Macedonia in the Southeast (or as a Yugoslavian song says, From Vardar to Triglav, From Djerdap to the Adriatic). I will never forget that stunning sight. It is that much more sad that Tito has been much maligned by the radical nationalists, and even more sad that the common people who once cried for him now rejected the memory of him. Tito is often portrayed as a communist - there is no doubt that he was the leader of the Yugoslavian communist party. But above all, Tito was a nationalist, fighting for the southern Slav peoples of the Balkan peninsula. Not many Westerners know that Tito never allowed Stalin to absorb Yugoslavia into his Eastern Bloc, or Warsaw Pact. Tito, along with Nehru and Nasser, was the founder of the Non-Aligned Movement. The world, not just Yugoslavia, lost a great man on May 4th, 1980 at 3:05pm, when Tito succumbed to illness in a hospital in Ljubljana, Slovenia, just short of his 88th birthday. The world needs more leaders like him, leaders who truly strive to unite and spread peace. So, indeed, may he rest in peace
0	Boring This video was very boring compared to the "Elmo's World" videos that my son loves. I guess if you are looking for something low key and relaxing for a baby to watch it is a good choice. It is not good for a baby who really loves fun music and action. My son was 10 months old when I played it and he wasn't interested at all and neither was I. The song choices were dissapointing. It was tedious to sit through, but luckily at only 30 minutes long it was almost over before it started
1	Unexpected Great Find All of us over 40 types looking for a trip down memory lane with the likes of Supercar (Mike Mercury) and Fireball XL5 (Steve Zodiac) can take a more engaging trip with Captain Scarlet, which didn't air in the U.S. It's like discovering a lost and forgotten series. UFO fans will recognize the voice of Captain Blue as Ed Bishop. It's also somewhat uncanny that a show written 40 years ago about the Mysterons "war of nerves" against mankind is not unlike the present-day threat of terrorism. Unlike Supercar and XL5, people do die in this series, so small children might be disturbed. Personally, I think this is the best series that Anderson ever did (sorry Thunderbirds fans)
0	So Stupid, It's Funny I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it.
0	Melinda + Melinda = Boring Melinda and Melinda is a concept film. And a good concept at that. Basically, two writers are having dinner with some friends and discussing whether life is comic or tragic. A friend begins to tell a story and each writer gives their perspective on how to make it a tragic or a comic tale. So begins our two movies within the movie. With the director, and such a great cast, you'd think this film would easily be bound for greatness. On the contrary, you're bound for boredom. The biggest problem with the movie is the casting of Radha Mitchell as Melinda, the only character that is involved in both stories. Her acting is stilted and she stumbles along taking scene after scene down with her. Another fault is the fact that none of the other actors are in both stories. Melinda and Melinda would have been a much more interesting film (both for the audience and for the actors) if the entire cast would have been involved in both sides of the story. As it is, the story switches back and forth between the two at a confusing pace, and doesn't apologize for moving slowly and drudgingly along. Will Ferrell offers the only breath of fresh air in this film as a married man who falls in love with Melinda and can't tell her. Overall, this movie is quite slow and although there are moments of clarity and even brilliance, you will find yourself wishing to fast forward til something intersting happens... and if you do so, you may find you've missed the whole movie
0	It just never gathers steam. Sure, it's steamy, and the leads are sexy, but we never really get a chance to know or care about them, so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter. In fact it was a little boring. Plus, what language are these folks speaking? I know it's English, but it might as well be French. The supporting cast is universally nasty, selfish, uninteresting, and unlovable. Not much to like here. Avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights, of which there are a couple
0	Banal Binoche extravaganza This film began as a beautiful European historical period piece, in Paris, which lush costumes, gorgeous people, etc. But after an hour, it deteriorated into incredibly boring melodrama with Binoche placed in alternating picturesque European cities and sex scenes. No deep emotions are penetrated, more than many other Binoche vehicles like "Chocolat" and "The Horseman on the Roof". I couldn't wait for it to end -- it's 2 hours seemed like 4
1	Not historically accurate, but gripping and moving nonetheless... In 1955, playwrites Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee published their play, Inherit the Wind, in response to the anti-Communist lynch-mob mentality of the post-WWII/Korea era. Based in part on the historical events of the 1925 Scopes "Monkey" Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, Lawrence and Lee delved into the questions of tryanny by the majority and mob rule through the dramatization of the week-long "circus" surrounding the trial. The subsequent faithful screen adaptation of the story in 1960 employed not only the explosive dialogues and confrontations of hypocracy of the play but also employed the magnificent performances of acting legends Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. Portraying, respectively, rumpled and disheveled defense attorney Henry Drummond (Clarence Darrow in the real-life trial) and the religious populist and volunteer prosecutor Matthew Harrison Brady (William Jennings Bryan), this film adaptation grips the imagination and leaves viewers emotionally and physically grasped by the courtroom proceedings and by the various confrontations between the old world that was and the new world that was coming. This film is as compelling today and perhaps moreso than it was when it was first released. Anyone wanting to enjoy two bravura performances of two of America's truly great actors is encouraged to set aside a couple of well-spent hours to watch and experience this film
1	Authentic and a great depiction of occurances in the Afganistan war I am going to keep this short and sweet I really Liked this movie and have watched it several times. I only have one complaint, I wish it were offered in Russion with subtitles. It appears to much like they are Americans, no accents
1	Battle of the Bulge I am very interested in WWII movies and find this one to be one of the best out
1	A HIGHSIERRABASSPLAYER FIVE-STAR RATING! The difference between the reviewers loping off a star and those giving this DVD a five-star is obvious - the lopers are people that don't play! This DVD (three actually) is an excellent production in sound and video quality as well as performance. The supporting bands are excellent as well. Hey, we're all aging, even you three and four star critics. It is indeed rare to get blues and jazz from these masters in the first place, and all the live performances will preserve our blues and jazz heritage. If you love the blues and jazz, this DVD is pure and simply excellent.
0	not very useful I felt the author was showing off his skills but not teaching much. Other than the very basics, you will not learn much about rythms and technique from this DVD.

I share the dismay of other reviewers about the unconscionable decision on Disney's part to release, in 2005, the wonderful Hayley Mills movies in fullscreen format instead of in their original aspect ratio, and in slapdash form in general. I have eagerly awaited the DVD release of this film, The Moonspinners and That Darn Cat, and am bitterly disappointed. What a waste! I encourage all fans of these films to visit http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/ and complain to them directly, as I have
1	Beautifully filmed noir piece I really like this film. First of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at. Tahoe and water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed. The story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children. Intense, often suspensful and sometimes creepy, this is a keeper. Swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve. SHe is amazing to watch. The rest of the cast is fine their roles, whether shady, clueless or sympathetic. Well worth a view
0	Unworthy Sequel In 1978, when film critic Roger Ebert interviewed Irwin Allen, the mega-producer suggested a potential story idea for a planned sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure"...The survivors of the Poseidon disaster would be rescued and taken to land in Italy where they would be placed on a train which would go through a tunnel in the Alps. The tunnel would collapse and everyone would be trapped under the mountain. Ebert thought it was an excellent idea. And as it turns out Mr. Allen should have went with it. Because the movie he wound up making is an idiotic waste of time; ranks among the worst sequels ever made; and marked the beginning of the end of Allen's reign as the "Master of Disaster." Side note: Allen directed this mess and, as "Beyond TPA" star Michael Caine said in his autobiography, good ol' Irwin should have stuck to producing! Worth a look for "Poseidon" fans, but that's about it.
1	Not to be missed If you have not seen this little gem based on E.M Forster's first published novel then you are in for a treat. An excellent story adapted to fit the screen perfectly with sublime performances from Rupert Graves and Judy Davis. A very fine series of moments. Go ahead treat yourself to a bit of class
0	One of the worst movies ever made!!!! This movie is very gross. This movie is horrible. The movie is a disgrace to the movie industry. I am so glad that I had got this cheap. I will be getting rid of it. It would be an insult to my dvd collection for me to keep this video. This movie is a waste of everything used to make this movie. It was also a big waste of my time. "Howard the Duck" was better than this. This movie was just flat out horrible.!!!! I used to collect GPK stickers I thought they were cool. To see this movie I am just apalled I didn't know there was a movie out there so horrible.

1	#25: ANOTHER EXCELLENT ZATOICHI EPISODE The 25th episode of Zatoichi finds the ever humble blind masseur on his way to his hometown. It has been years since Zatoichi has visited his family; and with a toss of a coin, the protagonist finds himself back to a different village that he left many years before. One of the changes Zatoichi finds is that he has a sister who was raised by the same woman who raised him. Only the old woman is now deceased: Zatoichi has been away far too long. Also, Zatoichi meets a man who grew up with him as a young boy. This man is now a corrupt government official. When Zatoichi is giving this friend a massage, the official says that he does not know Zatoichi, yet ichi knows that the official is lying. Ichi relates what they did as children, and still the official rebuffs him. The official is not only corrupt, but he has no honor and decency. The official is attempting to claim the village's quarry, which is the main source of income for the people who live there. And this angers Zatoichi. One of the greatest actors in cinema history also makes his appearance in the film. Takashi Shimura--of the famed "SEVEN SAMURAI" and "IKIRU" by Akira Kurosawa, portrays the old man who is watching over the new-found sister of Zatoichi. Takeshi Shimura has always been my favorite actor, and it was wonderful to see him in this episode of Zatoichi. The conclusion of the film is a strange one, which I do not wish to give away. However, Zatoichi confronts his old childhood friend. And as he does he struggles with the problem of whether or not to kill him. This is an excellent Zatoichi episode. The cinematography is great, and the character actors in the film--especially the corrupt official--are great. I highly recommend this great episode of "Zatocihi's Conspiracy" to all viewers.
1	A fine Jimmy Stewart western The American frontier shifts north to Alaska in this tightly paced Anthony Mann western, starring Jimmy Stewart as a hard-bitten, cynical cowboy loner who finds himself caught up in the Klondike gold rush, and with it, the struggle between lawless injustice and the budding new civility. Walter Brennan gets a choice role as Stewart's stammering, old-timer sidekick; John McIntyre is delicious as the unrepentant villain, Judge Gannon of the border town called Skagway, who runs the place as his own personal company town. Stewart plays his antihero to the hilt, and the on-location cinematography is impressive... A nice, taut, enjoyable film

0	Deconstructing Annie Hall -- One of Woody Allen's Least Memorable Films `Anything Else' reminds me of Woody Allen's earlier masterpiece `Annie Hall' in more than one way - a love romance in New York City, an aspiring comic writer, funny one-liners, jazz songs, and most of all, the choice of the hero/heroine who might or might not leave the city. The difference is that `Anything Else' doesn't achieve the level of humor and pathos of `Annie Hall.' Perhaps the film's soulless touch might reflect Allen's own feelings about the city and filmmaking itself these days, and also explain this strangely weariness of the film that is very disappointing. Jason Biggs plays Allen's alter ego, young comedy writer Jerry who really wants to write a serious novel. He struggles to make his dream come true for all this incompetent agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) and his frigid girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci) who refuses to sleep with him (for six months). Perhaps some viewers would find these characters unlikely or worse, unlikable - and Jerry and Amanda are all living in a nice, clean room together in New York City, and afford to hear Diane Krall singing and stay in a hotel (single room, $200) - well while we are watching these annoying and implausible characters, another irritating person arrives. It is Amanda's mom Paula (Stockard Channing), who 'tries' something new (here white powder) ... like in 'Annie Hall.' This formula of vintage Woody Allen comedy with eccentric characters might have worked in the 70s and 80s. Actually, there are some funny jokes from Allen himself, playing Jerry's mentor David Dobel, but the film itself, especially the first part, is slow and boring. Fast and snappy dialogues are not to be found, and the character of Ricci, who fails to show the charm of a real coquette, is only irritating. Actually, the casting itself is the real problem. Jason Biggs is not convincing as struggling Jewish writer, and neither is Ricci as whimsical heroine. I know it is too much to expect from them the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton, and what is more embarrassing is that Ricci is seen prowling in her underwear, as if compensate the lack of that credibility of romance. `Anything Else' is definitely not meant for those who are going to watch Woody Allen films for the first time - in that case, he or she would never come back again -- nor for his devoted fans, who prefer his films with romance, humor, wit, and insightful observation about life. It took nearly three years for the film to be released in Japan where I watched it, and now I know the reason for the delayed release
0	Lover's Lane......another horrible wannabe slasher movie to add to the pile Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the "Hook Man" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns arent even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous

1	The World's Greatest Dance Show All I can say is that if there is anyone who doesn't love this show after seeing it than we don't live on the same planet. This show inspired me to take Irish dancing. Now I've worked my way up to going to the world championships next year! In other words, it's a masterpeice. Personally I would give this 10 stars. There just is no comparison
0	Slapstick & boring Too slapstick, silly & boring. I couldn't suffer through the first episode of this one
1	A Must See Movie Ioan Gruffud IS Horatio Hornblower, to a fault-even as a lean, mean sea captain. His shocking good looks make him an instant HIT. But blimey! He marries his landlady's daughter Maria? I half expected the bloke to marry a demure lovely Keira Knightley type. His ladylove is at least 8 years his senior, and perhaps this explains his desperation to return to the briny deep! Besides Ioan, another hero in this movie is GREG WISE-- as a French turncoat his acting was STUPENDOUS. Good job Greg
1	saljac Finally, a sophisticated adult movie without the mindless violence and language prevailent in most current movies. The interplay between the main characters is a joy, and, accompanied with a sharp dialogue. I wish they would make more movies like this. If you like this movie, checkout "Roughcut".
0	Bad hair day Mel? I chose this film thinking it would be Mel Gibson when he was still good. Yes, he was good, but I'd seen it many years ago, when I was still at school, and didn't remember. Until I was watching the film and thinking that I'd already seen this before. I had an inkling that I'd already seen it, when the girl jumped off the building (I think I had a moan about why she had to be almost topless the first time round) and then Mel gets out of bed. I definitely remember that scene! Damn. The thing about watching Lethal Weapon now, is that it's been either spoofed too many times or it's been copied so many times. Almost every 80s cop movie is like this. Good cop, bad cop. Neither wants a partner. Then they realise they can't work without each other. And it spawns some mediocre sequels. In the case of the spoofing, see Loaded Weapon, with Emilio Estevez and Samuel L Jackson. There was nothing particularly stand out about this film - apart from Mel's hair, which was just awful - I liked the pairing of Mel & Danny, and I liked the albino Gary Busey, playing a bad guy, who doesn't even flinch at his arm getting burnt with a lighter. Ouch. The guy about to commit suicide from the top of the building and then having Mel's character handcuffed to him was the stand out scene for me, not including the opening scene. The reason I'm only giving this 2 stars (which isn't going to go down to well with some reviewers) is because if I'd seen it when it originally came out, I probably could have given a higher rating. But we've seen it all before these days, and yes, it may have been a brilliant movie then, but not so much for me. For me, I would like to see another sequel to this. Maybe Mel could grow his hair again? I mean, there is another Indiana Jones on the way, and another Die Hard. Lets revive Lethal Weapon shall we? You're never too old, as Harrison Ford is proving and Mel and Danny are both younger. They could still do it. Couldn't they? Maybe Mel could save his reputation. Most reviewers consider this a classic, but in my case, it was worthy of a watch, but I don't remember being that impressed by it the first time round. (So much so that I didn't realise I'd already seen it!) If you saw it the first time, relive the happy memories, and watch it on HD, cos it amazing. (Bearing in mind I did see it on VIDEO, so anything is better than that.
0	Truth? If you would like some factual information underlying the glitz and glamour portayed in this video, please contact an organization on comercial sexual exploitation. We can tell you about the whipping with coat hangers combined with salt water baths, or curling iron burns all over the body followed by hot curling irons (...). Sound glamorous? All because you didnt finish up your whole box of condoms. If you believe these con-artists (gamers), you are very naive. Dont be ignorant, get the facts. But be prepared to deal with changing your views about the women involved in this lifestyle when you do. The only good thing artistically these films do is to evoke dynamic discussion on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And no, legalizing it wont make it go away
1	This movies looks awesome on blu-ray!!! Superman Returns is a must have if you just recently bought a blu-ray player. I heard many negative comments about blu-ray as compared to hddvd before I bought my PS3. I still have not seen an hddvd so I am not going to say anything negative about it, but as far as blu-ray every movie I have seen has blown me away. Not only is the picture amazing, but the sound on my surround system is also much better. Like I said this movie looks particularly awesome. I also recommend Invincible on blu-ray
1	One of the better sequils! This is actually a well plotted, scary horror film. The opening credits of children singing while a camera roles through a dark corn field tells you that your in for a treat. It starts out when a group of foster parents are found badly decayed in a celler. Now, the cult of evil children are up for addoption! With satanic plans on there minds, they must be stopped soon before another massacre of adults befalls the isollated town. When elders who know of the evil inside the children speak up the children go on a mission to convert any new child in the area, and kill any adults who get in their path. Can a boy and his father stop them before they reach their goal? Featuring great effects and scary suspence.
1	Hot and Greasy, but well worth it. I saw this documentary last weekend at the River Run Film Festival in Winston Salem and it was a smash hit. George Motz did a superb job of uncovering one of our most treasured cultural icons in an entertaining and hillarious way, and that is saying a lot coming from a vegetarian. This guy has definitely got a great career ahead of him
0	Some little gnostic ideas with lots of unpleasant music! Well, I must say that the DVD has many aspects: 1. Most of the music is absolutely annoying and horrible for a topic such as gnosticism. Furthermore, the volume of the music itself sometimes does not allow us to listen clearly to the words of the narrator. 2. Everything in reduced to this: GNOSIS is an alectromagnetic experience with the quantum universe that lies within the self. Hence, to be illuminated by Christ or to be a Buddha is just to achieve an electromagnetic condition offered by the union with the Universal Mind and the kundalini in us. 3. The narratror fails to expose a very important and key idea: there are TWO types of kundalini and two main centers in the human body. He never speaks of the Kundalini of the Heart. He speaks only of the lower kindalini, the one responsible for the human sexuality. 4. Anyway, it is worth to watch the DVD once. But be prepare to endure a very disgusting and annoying music that hides the most important thing: the words of the narrator! Too much especualtion, at the end. It is sad that there is not yet in the market a good DVD on GNOSIS or Gnosticism, made with ellegance, fair scientifical research and seriousness, without any music at all as the background. This DVD is an excellent example of how annoying can music be!
0	Shallow characters, bizarre story That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating! On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it
0	Pretty Lame I rented this movie on VHS because that was teh only formate they had. I think its pretty FReaking Lame. The Sport Sequeces are cool, but aside from that it was very boring. Basicly i Think this movie was yet another example of Hollywood Movie Trash

1	"Are You A Fish? Are You A Man? Are you Melkur?" ~ Beware Taxicab Drivers With Boney Sticks David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a well respected lawyer and family man living and practicing in Sydney, Australia. Of Occidental origin and Anglican faith, David has never been one overly concerned with the intangible, unexplainable mysteries of life. However his predictable, concrete world has recently been disrupted by a series of vivid and disturbing dreams that have called into question the very nature of reality. Unable to sleep for fear of more night visions he buries himself in his work. His Stepfather, Reverend Burton (Frederick Parslow), notices the change in David's demeanor during a weekend visit with the family and questions his Stepson on the matter. David confides in him with the statement, "I'm having bad dreams." As a conversation ensues David is reminded of a series of repetitive nightmares he had as a child. He would awaken in the morning to tell his parents that taxicab drivers came to him in dreams and took him on long drives during the night. That's why he was always tired in the morning. Despite the ongoing dreams and a serious lack of sleep life must go on. He is assigned his first homicide case, he is to defend a group of aborigines in what appears to be a tribal ritual murder. The night before he is to meet his new clients he is visited by a young aborigine in another vivid dream. The unidentified man is holding a triangular rock containing some cryptic carvings and symbols. He stretches out his arm towards David as though offering him the stone. This dream unexpectedly and dramatically takes human form the next day when he meets Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), one of the murder suspects. Chris just happens to be the aborigine in his dream. David invites the young man to his home for dinner in an attempt to discover the truth not only about the murder case, but the meaning of dreams. When Chris arrives for dinner that evening he is not alone. He has brought Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula), an aborginal "clever man" or shaman (who earns a living in the city as a taxicab driver). Thus is the beginning of a journey into a reality that Western Civilization has all but forgotten about. This is the "The Dreamtime" a separate but equally valid stream of consciousness existing alongside our waking world. David is soon to discover that his dreams are inexplicably connected to this archaic world and he is about to play an important role in either the continuation or destruction of both worlds. In my estimation this is without question director Peter Weirs' signature film. He has captured on film something I wouldn't have thought possible, giving us a brief but illuminating firsthand glimpse into the very heart of aboriginal shamanism. The conversation concerning the 'nature of dreams' between David, Chris and Charlie is one of the most fascinating and mesmerizing mystical moments in cinematic history. Richard Chamberlain is perfect in the role of David Burton. His ability to express his inner turmoil and fear of the unknown with the absolute minimal amount of dialogue or gesture attests to just how accomplished an actor he is. David Gulpilil (Walkabout, Crocodile Dundee & Rabbit-Proof Fence) is also the undisputed best choice for the part of Chris, providing a most striking contrast with Richard Chamberlain in both worldview and physical appearance. However the real star of the film is Nandjiwarra Amagula. This of course is the ultimate in typecasting because Nandjiwarra is in fact an authentic aboriginal shaman. Truly a man of immense spiritual and physical magnetism, his mere presence on camera is capable of evoking the Dreamtime experience. If you have ever had the desire to pursue the shamanic path look deeply into the countenance of Nandjiwarra before you decide. Those eyes will tell you everything you need to know
0	Subtitles cut off If you speak french this dvd is probably fine - but for me there are better dvd's that focus on a dancer's life in a ballet company. The subtitles were cut off at the bottom and on the sides so you either looked at the dvd without knowing what was being said or you struggled to figure out the subtitles since they were only partially shown.
0	The Movie Is Just As Bad AsThe Book I'm looking at reviews and people are saying, "The movie is awful! Read the book." It's true that the movie is one of the worse films you will ever see, butI advise you NOT to read the book. It's too difficult to read and it leaves you with a headache. If you're in school and you're required to read this book, I suggest you just watch the movie (get the 2 hours and 52 minutes out the way) and get Cliff Notes. For real, don't watch the movie or read the book unless you have no choice
1	I Spit On Your Shoe I spit on your grave is a fun film for fans of Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" and other "Rape/Revenge" classics, There are some elements of this film that are genuinely gruesome, and others that are practically laughable, either way, it's not a bad way to spend 100 minutes of your life, not if your like me anyway. Joe Bob Brigg's commentary on this film is a great treat for anyone who has heard about this picture because of it's controversy, because he does a great job of explaining all of that, and also if your just a big movie buff and want to hear interesting facts about the movie, because that track is chock full of info that is a great addition and Joe bob is pretty entertaining anyway, Meir Zarchi also has a commentary track on this DVD witch is interesting because i had heard that he had kept pretty quiet about this picture since making it, but frankly i was ready to fall asleep about 40 seconds into his track so i can't really say i found it that interesting, all in all "I spit on your grave" is a fun midnight movie for hardcore buffs, and curious horror fans alike
0	only pricks like this film This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!
1	Jazz Messengers Live in '58 A stunning discovery in Belgian archives of a concert in Brussels in 1958 with the famous line-up with Benny Golson (tenor) and Lee Morgan (trumpet) that lasted only 6 months. Benny Golson's now famous compositions like 'I Remember Clifford' and Whisper Not' are still fresh, and it is incredible to actually see 20-years old Lee Morgan and hear how mature his playing was. The only visual document of a live performance of a legendary group. And excellent quality
0	Long and tedious, although realistic The movie tracks Mr. Lazarescu on his last night as he travels in and out of emergency rooms in search of assistance. The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long. Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life. The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about. The editorial comment that one can visualize how "suffocatingly slow time must seem" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that "suffocatingly slow" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out
1	Good, Cheesy Fun First of all, this review is based on the original (subtitled) version, not this Disney-edited DVD. Don't watch this movie expecting something of the caliber of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; you'll be disappointed. An obvious take-off of stories like The Three Musketeers and with a mood similar to the Batman movies, this film is often confusing and melodramatic, at times simply absurd. That said, the acting is decent and the fight scenes engaging, making for an enjoyable film. It's entertaining, if not earth-moving
1	or 1??? It m a y depend on your mood. If u r a highbrow critic and only embrace "La Strada", Bergman, Fellini, Minnelli, "Cabaret" and so forth u may be the 1 giving this film only 1 point... But IF u have a sense of humour, satire and respect for ageing superstars NOT past their prime - this is the 1 for u... Naturally, Miss Mae delivers her most famous lines and there are moments of embarresment - but on the whole - she still is magnetic and of amazing vitality being at the age of 86.... The supporting cast is god(Dom DeLuise a REAL TREAT) but so is Timothy, Ringo and Tony... Yup, the musical sequences are below average, but as I pointed out, is done with an awareness of humour... Many a spectator would wish Mae West had`n done this, but I must say, she does NOT come badly out of it...
0	Bad Horror = Mimic 2 This movie takes the cool concepts of Mimic, and then abuses, burns and trashes all the scary moments the first movie brought us. This movie is slightly worse than watching an ant hill in the summer. if that is your idea of fun - then enjoy

1	Character and Honor Top notch acting through a difficult subject. The loss of hope through capture, torture and betrayal in the face of brutal circumstances is the crucible in which true honor and self sacrifice rise to the surface. This prisoner of war movie, slated to release too close to 9/11, finally reached the public without fan fare and is one of the most powerful depictions of honor and true humility available today. When some of the prisoners are inspired to teach and study and redeem the time by sharing their gifts and talents, hope finds its way into the hearts of the prisoners once again. They now have something to live for, to look forward to at the end of the work day, and their "awakening" causes their captors to permit expansion (espeacially since their productivity increases). Ultimately, their honorable ways are admired (even if privately) by their enemies, who lack the compassion necessary to be truly honorable themselves
1	Wonderful. Das Experiment (Oliver Hirshbiegel, 2001) Hirschbiegel, who stunned the world a few years back with Der Untergang, always had the chops to make tense, scary movies, and Das Experiment proves it. Also based on a true story, this is a film about a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong, as twenty volunteers are put into a prison situation, with eight "guards" and twelve "prisoners," for two weeks. By the second day, the guards are acting like guards, and the prisoners are acting like prisoners, with the exception of Tarek Fahd (Munich's Moritz Bleibtreu), ostensibly a cab driver, but actually an undercover reporter (while the revelation of this in the film is wonderfully done, the DVD box spoils this little surprise, so I have no qualms about mentioning it here) who's covering the experiment for his paper. Things go horribly wrong in an astonishingly short amount of time, and while one of the doctors, Jutta Grimm (Andrea Sawatzki) begins to question the ethics of continuing the experiment, project leader Thon (Edgar Selge) is enthusiastic about the speed with which everything's going to pot. Needless to say, things get out of control, and everyone involved, including the viewer, quickly becomes aware that no matter what happens, there is no way this is going to end well. Hirschbiegel is a fantastic director, and here as in Der Untergang he's got a solid stable of actors and a terrific script to back up his native talent. If you've seen Der Untergang (and even if you haven't), check this out. It's well worth your time. ***
0	lousy script with nothing but.....???? either drinking, cursing, and laughing in the pub, or replaying the messy home life style. what is this? you call this 'one of the year's top 10 movies!', 'two thumbs up!', 'one of the year's funniest!'?????????? this is one of the most terrible movies with bore-to-death storylines i've ever seen. acting maybe acceptable but, with such a lousy script and a bunch of ugly young female actors, i have to pass. wasted my money was fine, but wasted 95 minutes watching this silly movie? well, absolutely not! rejected the dvd out of the player after about 15 minutes. thanks for nothing
0	... horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at al
0	On the HD-DVD relase This release doesnt play on Toshiba HD-DVD players. So if you have a Tosh better wait until they release an firmware update (I have no hope that they will be releasing one in 2-3 months). There are many other HD-DVD titles that wont play on Toshiba players, better check out before ordering one
1	Good show about a great fighter plane in World War II This DVD has been taken from a early-forties era documentary film made with Stateside audiences in mind. It was probably shown in theaters before the main shows during the war years. One of the big pluses is that the film is in color, and that the color is strikingly good for a combat film. Directed by Academy Award winner William Wyler (best known for 'Ben-Hur' and the original documentary of 'The Memphis Belle'), the film depicts life--and death--in a P-47 Thunderbolt squadron based in Italy. It gives the viewer a good look at Italy, not just the base itself. The strafing runs are excellent, taken by a camera mounted in the planes on actual missions. For a wartime propaganda film, it is quite honest and deals with the suffering of noncombatants, showing bombed-out buildings, children playing near a burned corpse, and haggard, war-weary men and women. The aerial footage is excellent, the dialogue is good, and the quality of the picture is also good. The film also shows the tragic results of a Thunderbolt crash quite graphically, as if to remind the viewer that war is a dangerous game and that there is never any guarantee that the pilots will return from their missions. This color film runs around 45 minutes. It is well worth the price
0	Read on..... You know a film is bad when you can't even finish watching it. 1. Russians don't fly F-16s or Northrop Tigersharks 2. Used airial combat scenes from Top Gun, Navy Seals and Iron Eagle. 3. Used ground explosions from Iron Eagle 4. SpecOp Forces don't manuever around like they are playing on a paintball range. 5. Editing was horrid (Airial cut scenes from films that take place in the middle eastern desert then jumps to what look like Pennsylvania woods) 6. Acting was so bad I started to chuckle at the cheesey lines and delivery. 7. Plot would be better suited for a computer game. 8. Captain of the 'USS Oakla'(no such ships exists) has a hat with SSN depicting his CARRIER's Class; well SSN means the hull classification symbol used by the United States Navy for an attack submarine that is propelled by nuclear energy, such as the Los Angeles-class of attack SUBMARINES. This was as far as I got, about 50 minutes into the film. I'm no critic and can enjoy a film for what it is but this was the most slapped together garbage I have ever seen
0	A pale imitation of an innovator I saw the show on stage. I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this. Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse. Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute. The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own. As a tribute to Fosse this is inaccurate. Therefore, for Fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works. Also, there is a too big reliance on his concept musical "Dancin'". The one good thing in this is the addition of another Fosse creation Ben Vereen. He shows why he can still pack a house. My suggestion is to rent Fosse films like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz. You'll get to see the real Fosse
1	Great Shavian comedy George Bernard Shaw wrote the screenplay based on his own very successful stage play of 1913, and he even took an Academy Award for it - and deservedly so. It's a crackerjack production, his best on screen. Leslie Howard plays the overbearing Professor Higgins and Wendy Hiller is the Cockney flower girl transformed into a "lady." Both are perfect, and the whole thing is a lot better than the musical it became (MY FAIR LADY). It sparkles throughout, and the Shavian jabs at middle class society ("Marriage - it's the proper thing, but it's not natural") are wonderful and are just icing on an already rich cake. Definitely worth a watch
1	George Bernard Shaw, ingeniously... George Bernard Shaw was simply ingenious when he wrote Pygmalion, and when the story was brought to the silver screen it did Shaw justice. Pygmalion is a socioeconomic drama where the distinguished Dr. Higgins (Leslie Howard) takes the a flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller) under his wing in order to set a bet with Colonel George Pickering (Scott Sunderland). The bet consists of transforming the poor flower girl into a lady of class, but this also means changing Eliza's manner of speaking. Asquith and Howard illustrate several different topics such as tolerance and understanding using a familiar approach that the audience can recognize as Eliza undergoes the change. In the end, Pygmalion offers an exceptional cinematic experience
1	Amusing Caper "The Assassination Bureau" has an amusing premise and for the most part executes it ably enough. Oliver Reed stars as the head of a consortium of international assassins who takes on an interesting assignment. Crusading reporter Diana Rigg contracts his organization to kill him. Reed takes up this proposal because he feels that it will enable him to weed out the weaknesses in the organization. Assistant Chairman Telly Savalas has other ideas, however. The film starts off well enough, has kind of a clunky midsection. This portion of the film feels more slapsticky than darkly comic. The film recovers and delivers a slam-bang ending. Oliver Reed is charismatically suave as Ivan, the head of the Bureau. Savalas and Curt Jurgens as a German associate are sublimely villainous. Diana Rigg, however, isn't given much to do as Miss Winters. The high point for her in this film is a scene where she is required to walk around in a bath towel. Not classic comedy but not a bad way to wile away a few hours
1	Very Erotic NUDITY!!!We get three different nude french chicks. All show bush. The film wasn't full of sex but it had this underlying erotic feel that just makes you horny. So when you did get to see some hot nude chick you were ready to go. The beast thing was strange but very erotic the way he kept getting harder and harder and the girl kept accidently getting him of as he spued gallons of semen everywhere. Nice full frontal and I found it very erotic. CAREFUL at the begining is some real horse sex. Gaint horse penis and throbbing femal horse vigina, I couldn't even watch it, very nasty, be ready to fast forward. What was the director thinking
0	Old Nick Shows Whatever happened to Hey Dude or Salute Your Shorts? THOSE, for sure, should be on DVD. Not the shows that are still on air
0	Wack Christmas Ok, first things first, I never seen the original, so I went into this flick with a clear, open mind. Bad move. BOOOORINGGGG as the day is long, about as scary as an episode of Home Improvement, suspenseful as an Applebee's commercial. Maybe the ending was good, seeing as I only made it through about 57 minutes before I had to take it out of my DVD player and sent it spinning frisbee-like across the room. If this was your idea of scary, "Dirty Dancing" must have REALLY freaked you out. Ho Ho Ho
0	This movie makes a 70's geology documentary look good Geez, with all the remakes of old horror flicks these days, I'm losing faith in horror films altogether. This movie goes to prove a point that horror movie creativity is headed south. The plot sucked, the acting was predictable and the pulse was about as dull as the script itself. I'm a fan of the Blair Witch mainly because it struck a chord of truth despite it's overly abundant attempt to be true, but the brothers who made that film wasted their budget on this junk. There are no doubt kids in grade school that can conjour up better ideas, create more realistic suspense and drive you insane with terror. But these days, horror directors fall back on old ideas, stale scripts with added gore and one or two decent actors, in hopes that their ship might sail, bringing in a budget that will carry them over until a newer, fresher idea surfaces. Give me your budget, throw in the towel and let me scare the s#$t out of you, because if movies like these are all you have to offer up, then the genre of horror has a fate sealed in doom
1	Maybe Eduardo Sanchez has a future in horror! Picked this dvd up on a whim. I personally hadn't heard anything about it, but I saw it was directed by one of the guys who co-wrote and co-directed (whatever that means) The Blair Witch Project. That's not great, but it was something to go on. In the very least it promised that the storyline might be innovative. I thought Altered was really good! It's a pretty simple plot: three hicks, who have been hunting aliens for seven years, finally catch one and take it to their friend's house. The friend, Wyatt, has had contact with the aliens before, having been abducted nearly fifteen years ago. Most of the hijinks involves these four guys Wyatt's girlfriend and the abducted alien. The story is sort of derivative, combining elements from Night of the Living Dead, the original Alien and maybe a dash of Signs. But this managed to take those pieces and still make a highly suspenseful film! The characters were fleshed out just enough where you cared what happened to them. Honestly Adam Kaufman's Wyatt stole the show. The man has charisma. As for the rest, in this day and age where every horror character is a sassy b*tch, it was nice to see dialog that was restrained and functional. They still managed to sneak a few jokes in, but they were so subtle and/or situational that it worked pretty well. The only one who comes across as an amateur is the girlfriend. I've seen oak trees that were less wooden than her delivery. Still, considering this was a nobody, no publicity, nothing, straight to video indie flick I'm surprised at how good she was in comparison to other similar projects. The special effects were pretty good. Everything was hand made special effects, so you don't have any of that fakey CGI smeared around. Movies ten times the budget haven't learned that lesson yet. The character design for the alien was pretty good. It sported an animatronic face and probably a small, athletic bloke in a rubber suit with the result being some of the best monster realism since Aliens. The best part was the disembowel scene; realistic without being disgusting, a chuckling that's-gotta-hurt moment if I ever saw one. Really, this was a pleasant surprise, given where the sequel to the Blair Witch went. Maybe Eduardo Sanchez has a future in horror after all
0	so bad that you wanted to watch it This movie was so bad that one would want to watch it through to see how could anybody even think of making such a movie. ok it was not an expensive movie to make, but would be very interested to know if this was the end for the producers and director of this movie in this profession
0	Not worth even the 1 star. Wow, i was shocked at this dvd release. i read a review of this dvd on amazon and i though its going to be amazing. but i was trully dissapointed. Derric Green is not a good vocalist for sepultura and he doesnt play good guitar which is needed for the old song from max's era. andreas cant play solos while playing old tunes because the drums and bass dont keep up and u dont even know what song they are playing at times its so bad. and as a stage performance by Green its terrible. he dont even know how to move on stage. the guest apperancec what the high lite on this dvd. the documentary is so lame i wouldnt even call it a documentary. its just a bad dvd but with a nice cover thats it. sorry sepultura, time for a change in the front office. aka Green Giant. sorry
1	A suprising delight We rented this movie and watched it a dozen times with my kids (ages 4-6). We kept it well past the return date and now we will end up buying it on amazon. The kids are talented little actors and this was a nice movie for the family. I can't count the number of times that little chimp made my 4 year old twins giggle and cheer. Great job
0	Eric is way to tense on this one Well this is going to be hard to say, because I like Eric, and I HIGHLY say these DVD's below are some of the best I have for Music. Eric Clapton - Sessions for Robert Johnson (2004) DVD Cream Reunion DVD Also, this DVD is closed captioned, which is great! we need more of this! But that's about it. Eric is so tense in this, you can just read it in him from the get go. I thought well maybe it will work out in the show, as many shows start off less that killer. But this show never got off. Sound is not that great either, its "ok" on sound, but something is not right, not sure what it is, older tech? This is going to be hard to say in here but what are you people smoking that write great reviews? Have you ever even been to a concert? I have been to over 300 in 20 years. That's not to brag, but geez peeps, this show is not even close to cool. Maybe it's me and my 6th sense, people always tell me I can read people pretty good. Well, I tried, and I wanted! to like it! But sold it and without even letting anyone see it, that's how off this DVD is. Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear.
0	He's no Robert Redford After reading the novel The Great Gatsby for school I went out and rented the 1974 version of the movie. I absolutely adored it. It showed the characters personalities as they were in the book. After that we watched the 2001 version in school and I found it to be almost unbearable. The acting was poor exspecially on the part of Toby Stephens (Gatsby). He seemed like more of a mix of Joey from friends and Boy George than a love struck man. While the hit and run scene did prove to be rather entertaining, over all I feel that this movie is just a waste of time and you would be much better off watching the 1974 version
0	Zombie baby is too much I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much. All taboos have been broken there is nothing left. Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore
0	Hornblower was not a defiant jerk.... As a Hornblower fan for many decades, I am very disappointed in this movie. Ioan Gruffud portrays a Hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public HS to show he is "cool" or a "big man". Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a "Question Authority" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, "cool" is the same as "cute"). Perhaps the other ones with this Ioan Gruffud are better, but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others
1	Why ALL of ANWR needs FULL Nat'l Wildlife Refuge protection or MORE; filmed with a touch of humor Unfortunately, the 1002 Lands at the northwest corner of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge don't have this protection from possible oil drilling, in an area estimated to have oil reserves equal to less than six months of current needs. More unfortunately, the Porcupine caribou herd doesn't recognize that it is in potential huge danger by coming here to calve every year, as the cows have for time immemorial from this large herd. Husband-and-wife Heuer and Allison gave themselves a belated honeymoon -- follow the herd from its winter grounds to calving area and back, all while documenting it. Heuer has worked in national parks programs in Canada and South Africa and already done yeoman environmental work by hiking the entire Yellowstone-to-Yukon or Y2Y corridor to popularize the need for extended wildlife area protections for large mammals. The humor? The movie starts with clips of George H.W. Bush, followed by George W. Bush, both saying that they can't see the need for caribou protection. So, Heuer packs a "W" doll with him for the entire journey, so he can see just why the herd needs its calving grounds protected. An incredible journey through rugged land, fighting off cold and variety of incredibly ferocious flying insects, this is a fantastic wildlife effort. Pair it with Heuer's book of the same name, and you'll fall in love with the herd too
0	could ANYBODY resist a taina elg musical? george cukor only ventured into musicals on rare occasions. two of those ("a star is born" and "my fair lady") are classics; "les girls" is assuredly not. this was gene kellys last mgm musical, and cole porters penultimate score of any kind, and neither master is at his peak; as a matter of fact theyre both pretty close to their nadirs. kellys attempt at parodying marlon brando in "the wild one" (already a passe reference by the time this was filmed) is downright embarrassing, and the supporting "girls" (when mitzi gaynor is the biggest star among them) just kinda sit there like a lump. if thats entertainment ...
0	Dont be deceived I thought this would be a fun. light evening - something to take my mind off my troubles - I am on ublic assistance so it is very hard to scrape together the money to rent a movie - I had free passes from Chirstmas so I go this with those. I remeber loviing to dance when I was a litle girl - I tapped and did some jazz dancing - nothing like these ladies - who do almost nude dancing in this "family" film. This story was about EMOTIONAL ABUSE - women suffering becasue some man has treated them like garbage. I was abused my whole liffe until one day I took a walk to a store (my husband had hidden the keys from me - I looked for them but at the time I was drugging - hooked on meth) and found a book on emotional abuse that changed my life. They shoudl remake this movie and the women should get revenge on the men for all the abuse. No one will ever hurt me again
1	Very enjoyable! I showed this to my middle school dance class and they loved it. I did too! If you love musicals from this era, it's a must-see
1	magic a lovely romantic movie just to enjoy for what it is. lovely scenes of magical food preparations! ideal for all foodies
0	Cheese. With cornbread. "All The King's Men" is a total mess and a spectacular misfire, a movie so poorly crafted by writer-director Steven Zaillian - who's directed some decent films - that it's not even fun to skewer. The acting is so arch and absurd, the story is so rootless and confusing and endless, droning, awful music is so melodramatic, that it mostly earns, mostly, our pity. Based on Robert Penn Warren's novel - itself based on the life of Louisiana politician Huey P Long - the movie uses narrator journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) to follow a backwoods orator named Willie Stark (Sean Penn) from county official to powerful governor. Stark is a populist, relying on his "hick" voters to give him carte blanche to redistribute government funds to public works projects - roads, schools, hospitals. As "All The King's Men" opens, Stark is about to be impeached by the state legislature. For what? It's never made clear. Zaillian treats Stark like Jay Gatsby - nobody's quite sure of the truth. Instead of details, we get allusions and random subplots involving Jack's childhood friends (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo) and surrogate father (Anthony Hopkins). All three play a role in Stark's fate, but their characters are ciphers. None of the performances are memorable. As Stark, Penn has two speeds. He's either a screamin bleeder, his voice breaking and his face ready to pop, or he's sleepily drawlin like he just ate a pan of cornbread. Stark speaks almost entirely in homilies, even in private moments. Penn's talent, which is turning the emotions of a role inside out, doesn't fit the role. He's bought too far into the myth of the guy.
1	I gotta catch my breath! What a fun show! We saw this when it was first released and had such a good time rocking away. We always loved the artistry and staging. But it is the music that sells the project. So thrilled to find it on Amazon in DVD format! After so many years, it's still a great show
1	Caution Advised, But Still Great! This 2nd chapter takes place almost immediately after "Zombie Island" concludes. While I don't consider this 2nd chapter quite as good as "Zombie Island," this 2nd chapter nails down the formula for a good sequel. It brings back enough familiar elements (the gang), but it offers a different adventure. While this 2nd chapter is not quite as intense as "Zombie Island," it would probably still be a good idea for parents to screen it before they give it to their children. Scooby and the gang solve a mystery (at least in part) at a museum and meet the writer Ben Ravencroft. He invites the gang to visit his 'quiet' home in Massachusetts. For an animated movie, the scenery is actually quite impressive. Well, Ben and the gang discover that the town is anything but quiet due to the publicity over the possible presence of a witch's ghost. (The Mayor and the T Shirt guy bear a striking resemblance to Boss Hogg and Sheriff Roscoe.) Naturally, our favorite gang gets curious but Scooby and Shaggy are more interested in food. (Big surprise.) There is a hilarious scene where they go to a restaurant that is too good even for them. Well, Ben and our gang meet the Hex Girls who play good music and at the same time draw some suspicion. This is a difficult movie not to ruin, but I'll try. The misleads make sense upon discovery, and just when we think the movie is over, we find out that the real horror is yet to come. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch of "Zombie Island," the climax is really well done and surprisingly scarey. Again, this movie may be a little too much for young children, but older children and even some adults are bound to enjoy this.
1	One of the best films ever made. I remember seeing this film as a young girl, and its impact has never left me. This is one of those films that is not well known so naturally it gets overlooked. This movie is truly scary in the sense that it plays with your emotions. Sure Friday the Thirteenth, Halloween, etc. are scary, but they rely on superficial violence and gore to lure their viewers. This film touches the human psyche; it brings out a realization that not all people are good and that there is pure evil in all places. When a film can touch a person deep inside, that makes it an unforgettable classic. I would recommend anyone, expect very young children, to view this jewel of a film.
1	We love it! This is one of our favorite movies (mine and my husband's). The end is a little confusing the first time you see it, but the movie is excellent. In 2004, I watched it three times in one weekend while writing a paper for a Lit class, and still loved it on Monday. The deadpan delivery of Kevin Spacey is perfection. When he catches his wife cheating and says "...you don't get to tell me what to do--ever again." He could not have said it better. Kevin Spacey portrays perfectly the average suburban man who is BORED with his life and is at the point at which he doesn't care who knows it. See this movie
1	MARIE WINDSOR-THE KILLING-WOW! Director Stanley Kubrick's first "major" film was this vastly entertaining noir,"The Killing",dealing with the robbery of a Northern California race track engineered by ex-con Sterling Hayden.(great!)His "gang" includes such character actor stan-outs as Jay C.Fliipen,Joe Sawyer,Ted deCorsia,as a dishonest cop,Timothy Carey(as a sniper),and the noir immortal Elisha Cook,Jr.(The Maltese Falcon,The Big Sleep)and as Cook's ultra-sexy and heart not made of gold wife Marie Windsor.Miss Windsor could play roles such as these with her eyes closed,but you will NEVER close your eyes while Marie is on screen,mainly in her beautifully alluring lingerie,which she wares most spectacularly. Marie is great as Cook's disguisted wife,who pours out her vemomous insults toward's her little Georgie non stop and without remorse.Naturally,she is not (sexually and otherwise)satisified with George so she has a younger boyfriend on the side,played by a youthful Vince Edwards.The plans for the heist are all hush/hush,but George in order in impress Sherry(MW) spills some of the details of the planned robbery.Sherry, who desperately wants out of her dead end marriage has a little surprise for Georgie and the gang after the robbery is completed but she needs her boyfriend's help,needless to say one seductive glance by Marie and Edwards is hooked.So when part of the gang meets to split the heist money,Hayden is late,the surprise will take place.The robbery goes OK,but the afterword is where all hell breaks lose! Kubrick's direction is swift and the story told mainly in flashbacks moves right along,at a fast pace.The film is only eighty minutes.Sterling Hayden,who at one time I could not stand as an actor (I was a kid when I thought that way)gives his greatest performance to date,only to be topped by his role in Dr.Strangelove(also directed by Kubrick),and in the first Godfather film,as a dishonest Irish Police Inspector.Coleen Gray as Hayden's loyal girlfriend is fine,I believe here career should have been more productive,as she should have been given better roles.She her In Red River,as Wayne's girlfriend,and as Ty Power's naive wife in the noir classic "Nightmare Alley".But this is MARIE WINDSOR'S show and she runs away with it!If you love noir you will LOVE this film!

1	It Only Gets Better From Here St. Elsewhere remains my absolute favorite TV show, and it even ranks high among all of the other forms of entertainment that I enjoy, like movies, music and books. It's the first show I remember watching that achieved a certain level of realism with its characters, and that had continuing storylines without being a soap opera. You could watch each episode without having seen previous ones, but you were definitely rewarded if you watched each week. It was also the first show I remember that wasn't afraid to take risks with its many characters- they weren't perfect people, and sometimes very bad things happened to them. St. Elsewhere was intelligent but highly entertaining TV, and it (and Hill Street Blues) paved the way for some excellent shows today that maintain similar standards. And so I've waited for a long time for St. Elsewhere to be on DVD. I'm not disappointed, but the first season is definitely different from later years. I don't remember much of the first two seasons, but it seems to me that the show hit its stride in year two and peaked in it third and fourth seasons. The first season is very good, but the characters haven't been developed quite as well as they would later, and its hard to be invested in some of them knowing that they would disappear after the first season with no explanation. Also, some of the storylines (especially those involving the psychiatric wing of the hospital) seem silly and unrealistic- almost more like something out of a sitcom than from a serious drama. Still, though, this is where it all started and it's clear that the groundwork was being laid for a great show. Minor details mentioned here will become major storylines later on, and events that impact characters now will play even bigger roles later. There are many genuinely emotional and dramatic moments, as well as interesting and well-written stories about medical cases and, more importantly, about the personal lives of the employees at St. Eligius. It would have been nice to have more extras, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I'm glad that the first season is fully intact (although it seems like they did substitute some of the songs- that is definitely not Bruce Springsteen singing "Born to Run" in the first episode). It's frustrating that there is no word yet on future seasons, but hopefully sales will be enough that we'll get the complete show in a relatively short period of time.
1	Excellent Pilates DVD !!!! This is the best instructional pilates DVD! I really like the fact that Sarah has a section that shows you the basic moves and principles before you start the exercises. As a beginner, this allowed me to go back and make sure I was doing things correctly. It is a great work out and I know this is a DVD I will continue to use
0	DISAPPOINTED Short, sweet, and to the point, I was extremely disappointed in this version of THE MIKADO. I guess I should have known it would be a poor production when a NEW copy is selling for $1.62. I learned a valuable, albiet inexpensive, lesson though. From now on I will read the reviews before making a purchase
0	I've wanted to see this movie forever... I've wanted to see I Am Curious - Yellow for what, 35 years now? It made headlines back in the 1960's when it was banned for having too much sex. Now I wonder what all the fuss was about. There was a little bit of sex, a little bit of nudity - but only slightly more than Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. Only the government could get worked up over this movie. The other 98% of the movie had to do with commentary on excessive militarism (this movie was made during the Vietnam era - the 1960's version of Iraq), Western support for Spanish dictator Franco, and social justice in Sweden. It might have been relevant at the time - and a small portion of it still is - but many of the ideas shown then seem quaint today. The movie (as well as the Blue version) might be good for historical purposes, but it just doesn't seem entertaining these days. I would have enjoyed it more in 1968.
0	Awful The Call is set to Carnival music and is simply irritating. The scenes are disturbing (for example a fly eating someone's head). It is also dull. I was neither entertained nor inspired by this. I wouldn't watch the video again if someone paid me to view it. It is a shame to get a video and immediately throw it away
1	So funny! Very funny, but there aren't any special features. I find that a little problematic considering how many of the cast went on to do other things, especially recently. Also, seems like it could be remastered a little bit, but it wasn't a big deal
0	Promises much, delivers practically nothing To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie! To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.
0	A let down I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull
0	Sorry, but no. So, before the other reviewers jump all over me and accuse me of all manner of personal deficiencies, let me state for the record that I am over 40, remember the Cold War very clearly, am not a PC leftist, and am perfectly capable of enjoying wacky farce. That said, this movie just didn't work for me. The premise was good, but the jokes were only occasionally funny - most of them were lazy and feeble and just fell flat. And except for Cagney, the actors were too shrill and strident. Everyone was straining SO HARD to get it across that "Hey, folks, this is REALLY FUNNY STUFF here, can't you see us sweat?" Comedy needs to appear effortless. This movie is wearisome. Okay, let the motive-sniffing and ad hominem remarks begin
1	Goldfinger is Gold Bond Perhaps teething just a tad over the top, Goldfinger, unlike its two predecessors brought to the screen a polished, gourmet spy in James Bond. No other cinematic spy comes close to Sean Connery's James Bond as portrayed in Goldfinger. This movie has everything, beautiful and sexy women, cool cars, villainous villains, gadgets-gadgets-gadgets, surprises, and Sean Connery. The plot became the standard in Bond formulas, much to all of our chagrins, but the story is pretty close to the original novel released by Ian Fleming in 1959. This is easily the best secret-agent spy movie ever made, and for many reasons. It is cinematically beautiful. It has much daring-do for Bond to get in and out of. The music is incredibly on target and set the stage for all Bond movies to follow. The women are incredible. The level of acting is top notch, from all performers. In fact, one of the great things about this film is that Gerte Frobe, who plays Goldfinger, didn't speak of word of English, and his lines are dubbed in, but you would never know it by watching the movie. Such an incredible flick. Highly recommended. That is, if there is a single person out there over the age of 18 who has not yet seen this masterpiece
0	wouldn't recommend it Love Felcity Kendal in Good Neighbors, but this mystery stuff doesn't cut it plot wis
0	Utter Trash (Worst Slasher film ever created) I saw this movie on on demand and I would have to say it is the worst slasher film I had ever seen. The characters are really bad in this movie. The killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl. The way she kills people is so weak. She beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak. It does not even look like it would hurt you. And he some how dies. The movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone. Most of them did nothing. Don't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad. And it is not even scary at all. It takes place for the most part in the day time. And the killer is the main character making no suspense at all. I would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost. It is so stupid. I really don't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about. All I can say is it is UTTER TRASH!!!!
1	Joy Ride Talk about movies for guys who like movies, this is one joy ride for sure!!! David Hess deserves the Best Actor Oscar for this completely ridiculous performance that makes you laugh one second, then become slack-jawed the next. For the fellas, we get bush, nice boobs and some good action.....for the chicks, you might want to rent another flick...haha.....ENJOY!!
0	Draco would not approve of this. I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart
0	not the best episode The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends. Their mission is to save "Friendship Day" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped. It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken. And what's more, the plot is really boring. Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid. The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY. Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun. Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different. It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice. Dora sounds older. There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them
1	One of the Best Adpatations Of A Novel To A Film &quot;Mother NIght&quot; in not one of my favorite Vonnegut novels, but the film adaptation is superb. This is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen from page to screen, and extremely thought provoking. I give it my highest recommendation
1	A Really Cute DVD - a review of "Bob the Builder - Dig! Lift! Haul!" This is a cute BTB DVD that has not only the regulars (Bob, Wendy, Spud, and the Crew) but many of the other favorite characters including Farmer Pickles, Mr. Beasley, and that tea making Mrs. Potts. There is also Scruffty the dog, and some adorable mice and bunnies! In the first story, "Scruffty's Big Dig", Scruffty the dog manages to fall into a bunny hole and get stuck. Muck passes by and gets spooked by Scruffty's howling, but it all works out in the end when Bob and the crew solve the mystery and save Scruffty. The second story, "Bob's Boots", has Bob breaking in new boots. The boots squeak and attract mice, which as we all know Lofty does not like. Lofty ends up running for home, followed by Bob, followed by the mice -- which Bob doesn't realize are there. Bob thinks Lofty is imagining that there are mice. All of this in interweaved with a sub-plot wherein Spud takes Bob's lunch by accident. The mice end up chasing Spud because he gave them some crumbs. In the third story, "Mr. Beasley's Do-It-Yourself Disaster", Bob is hired to build a garden shed, while Wendy is busy painting Mrs. Pott's fence. Chaos ensues when Bob gets diverted from the shed work to do a quick roof repair for Mr. Dixon. Bob and Wendy keep missing one another; and Mr. Beasley begins the project himself, working under the misguided notion that he can use tools. Wendy shows up to wonder what is wrong with Bob that the structure looks so crooked. She repairs it and it's actually pretty funny when Bob and Mr. Beasley actually think Mr. B did the work. The fourth story, "Spud Lends A Hand", is about the installation of a sprinkler system for Farmer Pickles. Everything goes fine until Spud 'lends a hand' and advises the crew on how to finish the installation of a rain-tank. Chaos results when Spud ends up giving advice to the Lofty and the guys. The tank breaks loose and not only rolls down hill, but destroys Wendy's gift which is a sailboat. Bob ends up saving the day when he takes the remains of Wendy's sail boat and turns it into a motor boat. The final story is "Dizzy's Crazy Paving". It's my favorite because it has Wendy in a 'if you have lemons, make lemonade' kind of situation. Mrs. Pott's wants a new sidewalk and everything starts out fine until too much fooling around leaves the square pavers that they were going to use, broken up. Wendy solves the problem by making a sort of crazy quilt sidewalk with the colorful tiles. The stories are linked by the mischief, humor, and creativity. Five Stars (for a Bob the Builder DVD). Five classic Bob stories on this one. My son loves this DVD and can watch it over and over. Sometimes he will focus on what Bob is doing, and other times the equipment, and yet other times the little animals that in the stories: bunnies, dog, cat, bird, mice. Great fair for rainy days
1	Good and Underrated This movie features John Wayne not as a cowboy but as a football coach. It is not one of his most famous ones probably because it is not the genre of what most fans think of when they think of John Wayne, comedy. It is a good movie though. When I first watched it I was amazed. Everyone (from Wayne to the actress that plays his daughter) does an excellent job. John Wayne's first role was in a silent in which he played a football player, and he also played football at USC for a couple of years with Ward Bond. So it is a subject he knows well. Overall, it gives light to a new side of the Duke, the comical side (which isn't bad). It isn't one of the best, I grant you, but it is great because it shows Duke's acting talents with a great script and cast
1	The Funnier Side of Vietnam Although the subject matter itself isn't amusing the characters in the film are. They seem to make light of a bad situation, the likes of which aren't seen anywhere else that I know of with the exception of Good Morning Vietnam. I enjoyed the action scene in this film almost as much as I enjoyed the comic releif, but not as much as I liked the music
0	I expect erotism and I get porn scenes This movie is a hoax. I expect to see a good erotic drama with Laura Gemser, and I get porn scenes...
0	Four Dances? You get three. This DVD claims to teach you four dances: The waltz, foxtrot, social quickstep, and the tango. What they fail to mention however is that the instruction for the foxtrot and the social quickstep are exactly the same. The only difference between the two is the speed of the music playing in the background. The dances are very thoroughly taught, until you get to the tango. The waltz, which is probably the second hardest dance to learn, takes the most time to learn with it taking up probably forty-five minutes of the DVDs total play time. The quickstep and foxtrot, both the easiest dance to learn, take up about a half-hour each, and the tango, the hardest to learn, they zoom through in about fifteen minutes, as if they were afraid of running out of time on the dvd. The video is relatively low quality, and after a time, the voices of the instructors tend to get on your nerves. Pick this one up if you want to learn the basic steps, but that's about all you're going to get, and remember that it's three dances, not four. Once you've learned the foxtrot, you know the social quickstep
0	83 minutes of my life wasted. What a waste of time this movie was. I could not wait for it to end. To call this an amateur film is an insult to amateurs. While I was watching it, the power in my house went off. I kinda hoped it would stay off. What I liked about it was the cover, thats it. I think they should just sell the case without the DVD. Or throw a blank DVD in the case. Here is the movie in a nutshell: horrendous acting, garbage script, filmed on what appeared to be a $50 video camera. AVOID THIS TRASH! The 1971 Zodiak Killer was bad too, but it was the kind of bad that was worth watching. Not this movie
0	Dreadful When it comes to cheap productions, this awful little mess should rank near the top of the (garbage) heap. Script, acting, and production values are nil, and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera; however, it is far less entertaining than the average home video. It is an utterly pointless waste of time and money, and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia. When compared with the bozos who made this film, Ed Wood looks like Cecil B. DeMille, and that is a notable accomplishment indeed. The size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film; however, when coupled with a dull and pointless script, sleepwalking actors, and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director, the low budget doesn't exactly recommend it. Admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it. The debate over this film is rather like the story, "The Emperor's New Clothes", in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it, whether it exists or not. This sorry mess isn't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it. Personally, I find this film to be an abject waste, so number me among the numbskulls.
0	Greatly disappointed Well I loved the book by Joseph Heller even though it can be hard to follow at times. The movie, however, was a huge let down. I did not expect it to be as good as the book, nothing ever is, but this was just bad. The cast sounds great, but the acting too over the top if you ask me. Especially Arkin as Yossarian, he just annoyed me. There were many characters I came to like while reading, but this movie doesn't give you a chance to like any of them. So much of the book is left out, which is to be expected, but it doesn't make any sense if you haven't read it. The anti-war commentary is almost completely lost and it has basically been turned into a comedy. Overall this was a terrible movie, especially considering how good the book was. It gets two starts simply for being associated with the book. Don't waste your money, just read the book
0	Absolutely Horrible As a sequel to a mega-hit movie this was a stinker. The thing I loved about the original was how it captured the late 50's with music, custumes, and attitudes and yet this sequel seemed to fall flat on it's face in all those categories. The songs are so out of place with lots of 80's ish themes being played during certain scenes. The producer couldn't even focus on one time period with the music which ranged from 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's metal at one point. The mood and feel of the movie was wrecked by this alone, without including the fact that the songs themselves were utterly boring. One or two songs were ok, like "Reproduction" and the biker song by Michelle Pfeiffer. If you buy this thinking it's a real sequel to Grease you are sadly mistaken. There's not alot in common at all with the first movie other then a few characters and the "T-birds" and "Pink Ladies". The plot is totally cheesy also. I'm not sure what I hated worst, the fact that some of the hairstyles and music reminded me more of the 80's or the predictable plot of the movie. "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" , "The Breakfast Club" & "Sixteen Candles" are so much better movies at representing the 80's if you are looking for a movie like that. The last thing I wish to see is a movie suposedly set in 1961 is for it to coming off in all respects to be 1982. When I watch movies like this, I like to be transported back to a place in time and feel the period completely. Unfortunately Grease 2 leaves me wondering exactly what time period it was supposed to represent. The only saving grace of this movie is watching a young Michelle Pfeiffer with brown eyes instead of her usual and what I thought was her natural blue eyes
0	Worst of the Worst I can't believe I spent my $25 Amazon coupon on this drivel. After reading the reviews I thought this might be a good addition to our growing collection of DVDs. NOT!!!! My dh and I have voted this the WORST movie of all time. "The Night of the Lupus" was our old worst. How can I return this disaster
1	Favorite Film Eighteen years ago we left California's Central Coast to live in Wisconsin where we've endured many a frozen winter evening with a bowl of popcorn and a movie or two. Of the many movies this means we've seen, I'd have to say The Lady Vanishes ranks as pretty much my all time favorite. I love the tension of the plot against the innocence of the time. This is a time we don't well know today - a time of gentle courtesy and concern for others; wrongness of bad things happening is simply obvious. This slice of a different day shows us life before electronic entertainment - the vaudvillian dancing, the whistling, the intricacies of human interaction and friendship - the respect shown automatically by the lady and her friends for each person. This is also before actors needed to be 'flawless' and shallow. Cruel enemies - both nationally and personally - slash this quiet, peace filled world. There is something valuable and instructive in this window to the past. A bit of accidental history that portrays wholesome times under international threat and prevailing open human goodness. It may be an odd reason to like a film so much, but there it is. This great plot, action, tension against the backdrop of a kinder and very real day, provide the kind of cultural fresh air that can give both perspective and direction
0	Zombie baby is too much I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much. All taboos have been broken there is nothing left. Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore
0	Made-for-cable schlock &quot;Random Encounter&quot; tries to make Elizabeth Berkeley look like a good actress but it cant be done, sorry. the story is so-so, and very by-the-book
1	One of the best nazi films ever made The best part of the movie was when the sentances were carried out. The men who did the atrocities to the jews deserved so much more but got what they deserved in the long run. I absolutly love this movie and the book.
1	Too bad no language options... Everything about this DVD was perfect... except they don't have the original Japanese version as an option in it. I know lots of people who like to switch it to Japanese and put on the English subtitles instead of watching Funimation's version of the show. This DVD has no language or subtitle options, so as long as you don't mind watching only the American version, it's a great dvd. I gave the dvd five stars anyway though, because Yu Yu Hakusho is too great a show to deserve any less. This DVD is the first of the Dark Tournament Saga, it is the next dvd after "Rescue Yukina" and is the dvd before "Deathmatch". I don't have to state the episodes since someone already has prior to me. Enjoy the show
1	A great film In spite of minor issues related to censorship of nudity, which do not affect the plot, the cinematographic version of the play is excellent. Both the acting and the recreation of the atmosphere of the Spanish Barroque are major achievements of this film.
0	Not enough info from Amazon Nowhere on the product description did it mention the content enclosed in the gift set, leading me to believe it was new or unique material. Unfortunately, it is 4 DVDs, one for each comic, 2 of which I already owned. Enlosed is White:Tater Salad Cable Guy:Git-r-Done Foxworthy-Redneck Engvall:Here's your sig
0	A total Let Down Sorry People but this dvd sucks, and I love Rick.. But this is like watching a root canal take place. it falls flat in every way you can imagine. I wish I had kept my money..
0	Evel Knievel deserved better then this flop. This movie was on TNT and the dvd will not make it any better. This might be worse then Viva Knievel from 1977. While I thought George Eads was a good choice I didn't think so after watching it. The book by Steve Mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script . You never find out why Evel started to jump for a living. They never show the showman part of Evel. Instead they show really stupid things like Evel going to the bathroom twice in the movie.
0	Great movie...VERY disappointing DVD release... This is one of my favorite comedies. It's not for everyone, as you must understand Martin's unique style of humor. That having been said, the DVD is awful. The transfer is decent, although could have been cleaned up more. Luckily, it's at least anamorphic widescreen. The sound, while hardly sounding like 5.1, still sounds decent, as i doubt surround sound was on the mind of film makers in 1979. Seriously, it's not Star Wars. Extras? Fugetaboudit! NO commentary. NO making-of. NO interviews. Just one delected scene, trailer, and a dumb ukelele lesson. The WORST part! There are scenes missing! Perhaps this version of the film is exactly as it was released in the theaters, but i'm too young to know. However, every time i've seen it on television, there were scenes not present in this release...such as the several different people requesting donations from the rich Navin Johnson. In this, you only get the Mexican priest. Where's the guy who needs new seat covers on his plane? That scene was classic! You know, this is the SECOND release of this film on DVD, and they call it an "Anniversary Edition." If they're going to give it a name like that, they could at least include the cut of the movie with extra scenes added back in. Maybe the commentary and a simple 15-minute making-of is asking too much, but at least give us the material that's already in the can
0	DON'T BUY THIS! They cut major scenes out of this film, which makes no sense to me. This movie needs to be released in its original format. They could have took out the pointless special features and used the full movie. It really makes no sense when the movie comes on TV it is the full version -- very sad
0	Disappointed in this DVD I thoroughly enjoy salsa, and enjoy learning from DVD's and tapes. The title and reviews of this product suggest one will learn great things about this lovely dance. Unfortunately, it is not clearly stated that this is for salsa rueda, not salon style or club salsa. Although the moves are nifty and presented in a reasonable fashion, rueda requires the expected step to be called out, somewhat in the latin version of square dancing. So if you are looking to turn your date around the floor in your own style, leading with non verbal ques, this is not your DVD.
0	My friend has a better title: "Glimpses of Bob" I'm giving this one star because "zero stars" isn't an option. There's not a whole lot of Dylan in this, and the "home movies" are just what you'd expect from the days of 8mm film: grainy, blurry, black and white films from the tour...not "of the tour", just from the tour. Tourist kind of stuff, with a lot of the back of Dylan's head, and every once in awhile he'll turn around - which is why my friend has retitled this DVD "Glimpses of Bob". And listening to Mickey Jones reminisce about his glory days of 40 years ago is kind of tedious; Mickey's looking like he's seen better days. Save your money up and get "No Direction Home", much more entertaining and informative
1	Very good dark Jackie movie. Seriously, he is in a dark movie! Wow did this one catch me by surprise. I thought for sure I was getting another goofy Jackie movie. NOT EVEN CLOSE! The movie starts out with Jackie as a drunken cop. After showing him in some disgusting drunken moments, we get to see why he became like this. There is a group of kids going around terrorizing the police. They will do a standard bank job or something like that and then wait for the cops. Having serious firepower, skills that will relate to the x games later in the movie, and already being rich, the cops certainly have theri hands full. So the cops have serious problems and they finally get Jackie in a deadly game of 'can you do this to keep your fellow officers alive'? Needless to say he doesn't and becomes a drunk. When the band of x-games teens are causing trouble again a young cop tries to get Jackie to help out. I know you have probably heard this type fo a cop story before but this movie is seriously one of the best looking movies I have seen in a while. All of the locations and buidings they are in are great to look at. If you have seen Jackie Chan's Who am I?, Rumble in the Bronx, or even the well done First Strike, then get ready for a change. New Police Story has very high production values and it is not cheesy. Might not be what you are used to in a Jackie movie, but it was a very nice change to see this. The movie gets between a 3.5 and a 4 but could have gotten a 5. Rongguang Yu(the Iron Monkey) is in this movie and him and Jackie do not fight. That dissapointed me just a bit, but they still had some really good scenes together. The special features are pretty good with behind the scenes, behind the dubbing of Jackie doing his voiceover and a commentary for 2 scenes. Also the picture is widscreened but the picture quality needs to be commented on. It seemed like I was watching a high definition TV. Very nice
0	kung-pletely disappointing! I love Jackie Chan. I love his stunts, his martial arts and the honor and humor that envelope his movies. This movie, put simply, dissapointed me. Granted I watched half an hour of this movie and ended it there. The movie lacked the usual enthusiasm and honor of a Jackie Chan movie. I was put off by the cops hanging suspended in the air gasping for breath, the gory blood and the constant reliance on violence to get it's point across. Many Jackie Chan movies get their point across without senseless, over-the-top and disgusting violence. The movie is poor quality, low budget, which I generally like being a fan of all things swordplay fantasy kung fu and martial arts across the board and through china and flowing into korea and japan. This movie, however, lacked anything redeeming...atleast the part of the movie I watched.
0	First season was brilliant but second season is a huge disappointment I was thrilled by the first season's creative and compelling representation of characters. The opening titles, music, dramatizations, editing, as well as, subtle humor of the first season, was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people, regardless of sexual orientation, could relate. I was immediately disappointed by the second season, however, as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp. I hope that the third and fourth season doesn't make the same mistake.
1	Masque of the Red Death Masques of the Red Death does not follow the storyline of Poe's story enough for me to use in the classroom. However, the tension and suspense is great
0	Go with the editor's review!! After reading the editor's review I was ready to dismiss this movie even as a huge Buffy / Angel / Bones fan. Then I read all the other reviews and reconsidered. Editors often pan movies I end up liking, so I thought I'd try it. I'm actually somewhat surprised that I didn't just give up halfway through. This movie was terrible. The plot was idiotic, the three girls annoying, and it wasn't worth watching even to just see David on the screen. Go with the editor's review and stay away - especially if your a Boreanaz fan! What bet did he lose to be forced to do this role?!?
1	At he top of her game Before she became so outrageous, she was really a good entertainer. This is her at her very best, and includes all of her most popular hits. Don't really like her now, but loved her then. Lots of memories. A great show, very enjoyable
1	One of the First and still best television docu-dramas! In the fall of 1974 I gathered with others at a friends house with the intention of going out for the evening. By chance, a commercial announced that "The Missiles of October", one of television's first attempts at a docu-drama (the other being The Andersonville Trial) was about to come on. We decided to wait 'a few minutes' to see some of it. Three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on. Silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of "you are there" that kept us riveted to the story. Looking back now I realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average American, namely, what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of October of 1962, when the world was on the edge of nuclear Armageddon. This work is very intellectual, superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes. It is important to remember that this was shown during an era of STRONG anti-military feeling. The country was winding down from Vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in '62 from when we were only children reminded us of what America CAN accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict. There is a LOT of good acting. The scenes are cleverly done, shifting between Washington and Moscow with tid-bits of B&W 'events in the world' film thrown in. We get to see "inside" the exec committees of both the White House and Kremlin and how they plot strategy. Attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably. "Pueblo" in 1976 did not capture the tension and mystique and television has simply never been able to repeat what I now believe was a dramatic miracle of production on screen. WELL RECOMMENDED.
0	Would have been better had they not called it DnD Basically I'm a fan of B-Movie fantasy films as well as a long time DnD player. I can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and I'd easily say that its not the worst B-Grade fantasy film ever made. However as a DnD movie it blows. I'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject. I can fully understand the need to change some things. This is a movie and unlike some purists I understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different. However this film bore almost NO resemblance to DnD. Fortunately when the sequel (Wrath of the Dragon God) was made this was fixed. Basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie. If you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok B fantasy movie that it is.
1	Carmen Jones I first saw this film when it premiered back in the mid-fifties. I remember wondering why there were no white people in it. I was very young at the time and not living in the US and was not privee to the political climate here. I waited to see this film a second time and saw a 'cut up' version on TV in the 60's. Despite its condition and the breaks for mindless commercials, the film was still entertaining and Carmen was dazzling. The film seemed to 'disappear' after that until the 1980's when I saw a showing at the Public Theatre in New York City - bless Mr. Papp for screeing it. Over the years, I have seen many operas and now know how 'grand opera' is presented. Still, I think that this is a valant effort and is worth seeing. The lyrics are great and worthy of the music. Ms Dainbridge remains excellent as Carmen and was certainly was sexy, as Carmen should be - unlike so many that have played the part in grand opera! One can sympathize with the young soldier going AWAL. The one oddity is hearing someone else's voice coming from Harry Belefonte's mouth. This film is definitely worth seeing
0	Adrien Paul , the only reason to watch The Breed. I rented this movie because i love adrien paul in highlander and well the premise that he is a vampire makes it all the sweeter. Unfortunatly he alone could not carry the film. The movie is set in an skewed alternate version of the reality we all know. The version we get is a neo nazi like world in a bleak black and blue hue. The funny thing right off is the human police station is littered with propaganda messages and posters. Why the filmakers put that in this movie is beyond me. I guess their trying to convey the surrealism of this world. Vampires in this "reality" exist and recently exposed themsleves to humans at a risk of being demonized. Then when the process is at its critical stage, a serial killer emerges from the shadows and starts picking off young college girls. We find out that the killer is a vampire and has a political agenda. Which is to stop the vampires assimilation into humanity. A great premise which is killed at the very begining.The acting at best was a classic b-film. The actors look as though they know that the script sucks but they try to make it seem as if it doesn't. Adrien Paul is very convincing in his role as vampire cop Aaron. He is the only bright spot in the film. Bai Ling is a eccentric female vampire who falls for Bookem Woodbine's character. I forget his characters name because he was as wooden as you can be. He doesn't fit the whole "tough cop in a bad situation trying to make the most of it" kinda guy. The scenes in themselves seem ridiculous. At one point in the film Adrien Paul's character is shooting at human cops because they attacked first i guess. He does this spinning in the air thing and you can obviously tell that he's spinning on wires. The sex scene reminded me of well a soft core porno because the music in that scene sounded just like the chessy music in such a film. Minus the nudity. You see them bumping and grinding but it never really goes anywhere. And they like showing a pillar apparently in the "bedroom" with ivy and water pouring down it. Maybe that is an innuendo. The nudity that is in the film is downright ridiculous and makes the audience feel embarrased to watch it. Over all i think it could have been done better and i only watch it to see adrien paul in all his sexy vampire glory. I'd let him bite me anytime
1	I liked it. Worth the $$$ to me After reading the many lukewarm reviews here, I didn't have very high expectations for this DVD of a 1998 documentary produced in part to hype the Lost In Space motion picture released around that time. But after hearing that there was one last scene on here with the 1960s Dr. Smith and Will Robinson in character circa 1998, I knew I HAD to have this. Turned out the documentary itself wasn't half as bad as I had been dreading. In fact I'd say overall it's pretty decent. Yeah, so John Laroquette is irrelevant to LIS, but I've seen many other documentaries hosted by people equally unrelated to their subject matter (--hell, Bill Mumy himself sometimes acts as host of Biography). At least Laroquette wasn't particularly irritating here like he could have been. Maybe if you're a hardcore LIS fan who has read every book and article available on the subject, then there probably won't be much new here for you. But as someone who always enjoyed the show but hasn't really gotten into the fandom side of things, this documentary was just right for me and I picked up many a new fact here and there (eg.: John "Star Wars" Williams did the music for LIS too? I did not know that. And the guy who did the robot's voice was a completely different person from the one inside the suit? I did not know that either.) It was great seeing the remaining cast members as they looked in 1998 and finding out what they had been doing during all the years since. I also found this documentary very useful when trying to educate friends brand new to the classic LIS with more background info on the show. It really helps to show them how important this show is to many people (yes, I am NOT a freak for liking this!), and why. After watching this, they are not quite so dismissive of the show and are more willing to try and give it a chance. Bonus material includes the original network promo presentation for potential advertisers (now also available on one of the LIS TV show DVDs), some SFX footage they shot of the giant cyclops for the show's pilot (I was surprised it was in colour. Did they shoot all the B & W shows in colour first?), and Guy Williams' screen test for Irwin Allen to get the part of Prof. John Robinson (my squeaky-clean image of Prof. Robinson is forever destroyed thanks to a moment when Williams seems intent on revealing to Irwin Allen the tender young age he lost his virginity at. Gah!) But the real highlight here is of course the scene with Will and Dr. Smith. Both actors deliver their lines as convincingly as if they had just walked off the 60s set, and the Jupiter II mock-up they are in looks quite authentic too. The scene is over in a brief couple of minutes and the ending is a little silly, but I have to say it was really great just to get one final glimpse of them. It will be the last, unfortunately, due to the death of Jonathan Harris just months after. I really wish they had done more like this and sooner, but I guess something is better than nothing.... So for me, this disc was the perfect way to complete my LIS DVD collection. Just like the extra disc included especially for the fans in the Space 1999 DVD Megaset, it adds that last little something extra that's really nice to have. I think that this is one of those obscure titles that will be highly sought-after by fans after it goes out of print, so grab it while you can. (--And for any people reading this from the DVD-making biz, howsabout releasing the episode of the 80s gameshow "Family Feud" that they mention in this documentary, where the cast of LIS were guests? I'd buy that!
0	Junk, the whole movie should've ended up on the cutting room floor I didn't read the book; I purchased it based on the actors, that was a huge mistake. Had I paid attention to the people who rated this with one star I could have spared myself the anguish of watching it. I have 24 movies with Bruce Willis in them and its goes without saying I now have 23 this went in the trash. I wouldn't think of even giving it away for fear someone found out I actually paid money for this garbage. I have a collection pushing 1800 DVDs and this is the first time I have had to write a negative review
0	EURO SLASHER ANATOMY reminded me of some of those European horror flicks of the seventies like TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE or SUSPIRIA. Franka Potente (who gained American notice in the two BOURNE movies) plays a brilliant medical student who stumbles upon a covert medical society which actually goes against the Hippocratic oath. This society has a renegade faction that is performing autopsies on patients who aren't dead! The movie moves a little too slowly for my tastes, and its dubbing takes somewhat away from the movie in that most of the voices all sound alike. The identity of the villain(s) is pretty easy to identify and once the movie establishes their identity, it just turns into one of those chase the heroine around in the dark films that culminates in a shoddy ending, and with sequel written all over it. (ANATOMY 2 was made a couple years later). It's comparable to our teen slashers, but because of the foreign aspects, it seems a little cheesier
1	not too serious, but definitely fun Wow, the reviews here are pretty high strung, like they're expecting this to be some kind of serious avant garde film, critiquing the early 80s, the art/fashion scene rebellion against the dullness of suburbia, sexuality, etc. I suppose you could try to load all of that into this, but I saw it as a parody that pokes fun at these types of pretention more than anything else. You get some of the atmosphere from that time, the characters and acting are pretty good, and it hangs together as scifi. There are some fun mind games in it as well, which are surprising to some viewers, but I do not want to reveal the hilarious plot twists. That is about it, no big deal, nothing all that deep. If you look at it as, well, entertainment, you can allow yourself to enjoy it for the fairly simple thing that it is. Recommended. Warmly
0	Yet Another Bad Career Choice for Colin Firth Whose Excellent Acting Is the Only Merit of This Messy Film Nothing is wrong with `Trauma' as far as the actors and technical aspects are concerned. Colin Firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident, and John Mathieson's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting. Except that, however, `Trauma' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll. As for the film itself, it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery, drama, character study, or whatever that is worth spending my time. Colin Firth plays Ben, who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris, '28 Days Later'). In spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named Charlotte (Mena Suvari), Ben's mental condition gets worse and worse, and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares. In addition to the premise that is no longer original, the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress (or singer ... sorry I forgot which) that does not convince me at all. And the most surprising thing is, Ben might be the prime suspect of the murder! But how? and why? The script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things I pointed out above, Ben must meet a seer (played by Brenda Fricker) who says something very predictable, and his estranged sister who is just forgettable. There are also big red ants crawling all over, paintings that imply nothing special, and the CCTV surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in UK. All these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students. The difference is, probably they know what they are doing better. I simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking (which it is not), and sincerely wish that Mena Suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days
1	Dull romance capped by effective suspense. Like many Hitchcock films, the first half of Notorious is more romance than suspense, but the second half pure noir. Cary Grant recruits Ingrid Bergman, daughter of a former Nazi spy, to spy for his agency. They apparently fall in love before ever starting an assignment. Grant and Bergman were two of the most attractive people of the 20th century, but for me, unfortunately together they almost bored me. I guess the chemistry just wasn't there; that's my opinion, maybe you'll disagree. However the suspenseful part of the plot picks up when he assigns her to spy on Claude Rains (The Invisible Man, Lawrence of Arabia). The best way she can find to get close to Rains, who knew her father, is to let him romance her, eventually resulting in a marriage proposal. Some of the most suspenseful sequences of any Hitchcock film occur as she's trying to get information from Rains, exploring his big mansion in South America. The suspense builds to a satisfying climax, making Notorious at least a 4-star movie, perhaps one of Hitchcock's top five, but not as good as North By Northwest or The Man Who Knew Too Much
1	Hard Core HK Action This is a hard core action film that keeps you on the toes. It potrays friendship and betrayal. Here we get to see the magic of Chow Yun Fat in action. His charactor Jeff is no Mr. Debonair-Distinguished-Gentleman but a gangster with a mission. Determined to payback the betrayal dished out to him in a robbery gone awry Jeff goes up against an equally dangerous gangster who happens to be gay and attracted to him. This is where the comedy comes in and Simon Yam does a good job of portraying the gay gangster. This is a must have for fans of Chow Yun Fat and Hong Kong cinema
1	Great Film - fox lorber version.... at least it's cheap Ophuls is a master film maker and watching Lola Montes is to watch what movies at their best are capable of. That said, I am interested to know what happened to the missing segments of this film - you always hear about it being cut callously - but I am not sure whether the original film still exists... Anyway, see the movie despite inferior versions
0	Great setting and premise but fails badly at delivering any substance... I took a shot on this movie figuring that the concept was relatively fresh and I have been into thrillers lately. So, I tried it. The scenery was terrific, the setup had lots of promise, and the cinematography was eerie. So, what went wrong? Easy.... the plot was empty and as others have stated, nothing ever really came of anything. There were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing. Again, great camera work and the building was truly creepy.... but thats not what makes a great thriller. You have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply werent any. And the characters....Uggggh! The film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them I would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow, painful way. Go ahead and try it if you'd like but I suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices. Ultimately, it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters. Its not the worst I've seen but it let me down as the expectations were pretty high after the first half hour. Not recommended
1	Magnificent 2nd time around The dvd was just as good as I remembered the tv show to be. The show is both funny and serious with some of the best characters in it played by highly underrated actors. Even if you don't like 'westerns' have no fear this is not a western. It is a fun show for all ages
0	stupid and unrealistic Rodney Dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon(Church of Jesus Christ) but this movie didn't get any fact right. the church is never mentioned by name for a reason. polygamy. look like Amish. a collection plate? this movie stinks and i'm very offended
1	Pure Stoke. I own a lot of surf DVD's, long board,short board,mix of both.What makes Singlefin special from the others is that it really is a surf "movie" with a story. Shot on film with great care. ANY surfer will love the pure stoke which moves through out this film. A must for surf DVD collectors who love the life of surfing.
0	Complete butchering of a good story I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned. Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad. Turns out, the word bad is an understatement. Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc. But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat. I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away. The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included. Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown. Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing. I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply "everybody must die!". Period. That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to. I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie. Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked. What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film? Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours. Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles? Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire. I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc. Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence "revealing" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place. I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me. Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time. But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie
0	With Friends like this... Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, I guess because people think he does a decent Irish accent. Nevertheless while under the drink mixing tutelage of "Obi-wan" Coughlin (Brown) he gets involved with Coral (Gina Gershon) later telling Coughlin of their bedroom exploits. To ensure that Flanagan sees the light, Coughlin sleeps with Coral to try to show Flanagan she was no good for him. Why Coral would sleep with Coughlin just because Flanagan said they were making nikki-nikki is a mystery (she's seen sleeping over at the apartment and all cuddily with Tom's character for God's sake). Anyway, what a pal, nice to see Coughlin really cares. Later, actually just a brief dissolve to ocean shores & islands, despite this friendship-ending dastardly deed Flanagan befriend's Coughlin while working in Jamaica. Now that (Brown) has found "true" happiness (Lynch), you'd think he'd want the same for (Tom), right? Wrong. Despite Flanagan's seriously developing affinity for Jordan (Shue), he dares (Tom) to bed the mature, rich and connected Bonnie (Lisa Banes). Of course, this destroys Cruise & Shue's chance for romance, despite his explanation that it's okay because "when a guy lays down a dare, you just got to." What kind of logic is that? Still later trying to make up with her, he claims he got spooked by Jordan, so which one is it? Finally, how nice for Hollywood to wrap everything up with death, attempted seduction, pregnancy, attempted bribery, and Flanagan striking out on his own in one of the riskiest businesses around a "Theme" bar. Although, cute at times, one has to wonder the next time someone dares Tom's character
1	Peter, Paul, & Mary Excellent overview of their whole careers. Good selection of songs and locations. Fun for fans. Also a good summary for those who have never heard them or seen them before. Recommend it for all ages
1	Enjoyable And Entertaining: A Fun Watch! "Shinobi-Heart Under Blade," is a fun and entertaining film. Suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for the film; and if you have viewed Azumi 1 & 2, or Takeshi Kitano's film "The Blindswordman Zatoichi," then you will enjoy this film. I was given this film by a friend as a Christmas present, and just recently viewed it; and I must write that I found it highly enjoyable. There is CGI in the film, but it did not bother me, considering the abilities of the various ninja's depicted in the film would more or less require its use. Also, the story itself is based from Japanese manga, called "Basilisk." And although I have not had a chance to look at these, I might someday. Just thought that I would pass this along. The film is set in 17th-century Japan. In the film there are two Shinobi ninja tribes whose villages have been at war for hundreds of years. The two tribes are called the IGA and the KOUGA. They have been forced to obey a decree by the Shogun who has unified Japan, and therefore has outlawed these two factions from fighting. Two of the ninja's from the different tribal clans have fallen in love: They are Oboro (Yukie Nakama) and Gennosuke (Jo Odagiri) however, both must keep it a secret. The Shogun however, sees the danger that these two warring ninja clans are to him, and decides that a tournament be held. Five ninja warriors from each of the two clans must face off in a battle to the death. These different ninja characters are extremely colorful. Each possess an ability in fighting that makes this film interesting. As I wrote in the beginning, this is not an Akira Kurosawa type film, such as "Seven Samurai," therefore, suspension of disbelief is necessary. Moreover, you will not find the depth of character development in this film that you would in a Kurosawa film: so what! the film is a fun watch anyway. I would have liked to have seen more a bit more depth in the characters in the film, however, I can live with this, as the film was entertaining enough for me to enjoy. However, the acting in the film is very good. Since the film comes from comic and anime origins, the characters do not dissapoint the viewer. The film seems a bit comic-book at times, but that is one of the reasons I think I enjoyed the film so much more. And besides, the visuals I believe were done incredibly great. Also, while not like your typical Japanese film, in terms of swordplay, the film is still enjoyable: remember this does derive from Manga. In the film these two ninja clans that send their ninjas understand the implications of their fight: the winners will serve the Shogunate, the loser will be vanquished. All of the fights take place while enroute to the capital, while the leader of one of the clans tries to persuade the emperor to change his mind. (Jo Odagiri) and (Yukie Nakama) give good acting perfomances in the film, which in turn makes this a better film. Once can see clearly that this film is adapted from 'Romeo and Juliet,' to some degree. Once again, this is an enjoyable Japanese film, not to be taken seriously, or on par with some of the great Samurai epics of the past, just an enjoyably entertaining film. Also, I thought some of the characters' powers, such as one ninja being able to slow down time were interesting, as it departs so much from much of Japanese cinema, in contrast to Chinese cinema, where this is so prevalent. All in all, a delightful and fun film. Enjoy it, and don't take it too seriously. [Stars: 4.5
0	This Movie Has Disturbing Situations... I bought these movies based on reviews and was puzzled when I noticed my 3 year old son was afraid of the green choo choo train. I couldn't imagine why until I replayed the movie and saw the scene where the green train was headed toward a woman stranded, yes, stranded!, in her vehicle on the train tracks. As she waved her arms in panic and stares at the oncoming train, she screams stop! I cannot imagine how this fosters a safe feeling for children unless you are into the scare tactic approach to teaching. I was really upset and offended that this was put into a kid friendly show. Sadly, I do not recommend this DVD. The idea of it is great, but the delivery was more than poor. I will return the others I purchased

0	Missed potential and lame music There is some really great computer animation from this era, a.k.a some of the Mind's Eye series and the like. But this one was, basically, a bore. First, the music was completely uninteresting and showed little or no connection to the animation. It sounded like half-baked baroque or classical done on a good-quality Casio. I could live with that, though, if the animation really grabbed me. Or, even better, if they seemed to have anything to do with each other. But the animation was, as my title implies, a tease. There were many, many brief moments were something truly interesting appeared only to be immediately abandoned for yet another kaleidoscope sequence. There was a lot of those. No, way too many of those. And I'm sorry, but I can pick one up at the dollar store if I want to see that. Also, if you hate having things flashed at you, there were a lot of those annoying instances where they transition from one image to the next with a bright flash. Very obnoxious. For really good animation and music, in favor of this I'd highly recomment Televoid (music by a mix of Queensryche and Kansas members) and The Gate to the Mind's Eye (Thomas Dolby). Both these have much more interesting animation and really great music. As for this, if you already have any 90's animation that you really like, you'll be missing absolutely nothing by skipping this one
0	What is the point of this film? ...I mean,other than making a profit for the studio(which,I understand,did not happen yet)...Whoever wrote the script for this doofus movie ought to be re-trained,and put to work doing street-cleaning,or garbage pick-up,or something that he/she can't screw up...Better yet,re-train the actors and actresses involved because obviously they did this turkey for the paycheck alone and gave no thought whatsoever to the audiences that would have to sit through this drivel... The premise of this film had potential,but someone,or,more probably,some committee decided ,Hey,we don't want to make anything that is actually good...Heavens no...what we want is a made-for-teevee spook story with a made-in Hollywood big budget...Where did"White Noise"go wrong?Almost from the begining...So apparently some lower level employee of the Michael Keaton charecter is some sort of nutcase serial killer who just may be in the control of some trio of disembodied demons...or something...Keaton's pretty,pregnant second wife goes out for a drive and never returns..Did she slip,fall,and get carried away in the river?...apparently not...apparently the afore-mentioned nutcase serial killer tortured and murdered her,maybe at the instigation of the demons(or maybe just because he is a nutcase serial killer...who can be sure?)...Anyway,one day some over-weight EVP practioner comes along and tells the Keaton charecter that the dead wife is contacting him"from beyond"...Spooky?No,not really,as the overweight guy seems almost a buffon..Later we meet another pretty blonde who believes that chubby-cheeks has made contact with her dead boyfriend..Keaton hears a tape that MAY contain his wife's static-filled voice,and he's hooked..Later he sees tragic episodes before they happen(and claim lives),and finds out that,MAYBE his dead wife is directing him to the scenes of local accidents ,deaths,and worse(again,we are never sure what exactly is going on)..Then the big guy winds up dead,but not before telling the Keaton charecter that there"are a lot of bad people out there"(sort of like in real life)..Keaton fails to prevent the blonde whose boyfriend may have contacted her"from beyond" from falling out of a high-rise apartment(which would have killed you or I but didn't kill her),he goes to an uncompleted high-rise where some missing housewife is being tortured by his employee,is maybe attacked by demons and dies...Oh,sure,there is more to this loopy script,but why bother telling it?I can write a better scarefest than this...Probably so can you..

0	I liked it...alright 2 and 1/2 stars Let me first start off by saying that Richard Gere is in my opinion a very so, so actor and in this movie, his crazy irish accent bugged me.and seemed forced. But, still, it's a descent movie thanks to Bruce Willis, perfect for the vilain in this movie. Jack Black also makes a short cameo but Bruce makes sure he doesn't stay alive for long. The movie is basically about a prisoner released from prison to track down a man that only him and his girlfriend can identify. And then, comes a very average move with some good scenes. all resulting around Bruce Willis. The problem for me is that at times, I wasn't cheering Richard Gere on whatsoever. That could have to do with his acting. On the other hand, Willis is great and very effective and also..very cool. But, what looks like it's going to be a good suspense movie ends out being like all action movies. and that my friend is something I seriously am tired of. Now, that I think of it, I own this movie. You know what that means. Hello Blockbuster
1	Pirates of the Caribbean, review by SL. I was sceptical about this movie at first, but I was supricesed how good this movie was. We have sword fighting, romance, pirates, kiddnapping and funny skelletons! It is absolutely a great movie and I truly reconmand it for both young and old. An amazing great and funny movie with exitmant
0	Terrible I could not sit through this movie. The acting and screenplay are terrible. This film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best. I ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before I reached the end. I couldn't take it anymore. This movie is one of the worst I've attempted to watch in a long time. Not recommended.

1	The best dark comedy out there This is simply the best dark comedy out there. The slow dissolve of the Rose's marriage into all out nuclear war is both hilarious and sad to watch. DeVito is brilliant as the narrator and in a secondary part in this movie. There is a continuity error in the movie at the end. When Gavin arrives at the Rose residence it is clearly night, when he comes back with the ladder it is obviously morning
0	"Well, I don't like this at all...computers and corpses are a bad mixture." I really had little idea the cinematic pain train I was boarding as I watched Rats - Night of Terror (1983) aka Rats - Notte di terrore last night. Oh sure, I read the reviews and what not, but to really get a true understanding of the film's utterly rotten essence, you must watch it, and experience it, for yourself. I've seen a hell of a lot of bad movies in my time, but I have to say, this fetid, moldering bit if Italian produced flotsam buried the needle on my Suck-O-Meter, something that hasn't happened since I watched Red Serpent (2002), with Michael Paré and Roy Scheider. Written and directed by Bruno Mattei, the man who gave us such wonders as S.S. Extermination Love Camp (1977) and the ode to the usage of stock footage Hell of the Living Dead (1980), the film features Ottaviano Dell'Acqua (Zombi 3), Geretta Geretta (Demons), Massimo Vanni (Escape from the Bronx), Ann-Gisel Glass (Deadly Eyes), Henry Luciani, and Fausto Lombardi (Don't Look in the Attic). The film started off well enough, with some displayed text telling us about how a great, nuclear holocaust drove those humans left alive under the ground, where they developed sophisticated societies. After some years, some (fool) hearty individuals decided on returning to the surface, to enjoy the toxic wonderment I suppose, and became viewed as primitives by those who remained down below. The story picks up in the year 225 A.B. (After the Bomb) as we see a motorcycle gang tooling around the wasteland (looks like an old rock quarry to me). As I was wondering just where in the heck they got the gas to run their machines, they boogie on into a dilapidated city, deciding this might be a good place to set up camp...and this is about the time the, as the boys from MST3k would say, the `deep hurting' began as the characters started to actually talk. Anyway, the find a deserted research facility, complete with canned food, plants (fresh vegetables and fruit), and fresh water, littered with gnawed on corpses...well, it's not completely deserted, as there's the rats, and plenty of them. They clear out the dead bodies, move into their new digs, and soon enough the mutated, furry, super rodents begin picking off the gang one by one. Not only that, but the verminous mongrels have eaten up the tires on the vehicles, preventing those who haven't become all ate up from leaving. As tensions rise, more annoying characters die (thankfully), and leadership of the gang comes into question, but there's little time for debate as the hairy horde begin their relentless onslaught (apparently grungy bikers are good eatin'...who knew?) challenging man's long standing position on the top of the food chain... Seems pretty straightforward, right? Well, perhaps, but essentially what I did was put a nice sheen on a stanky (stank goes well beyond stink) turd, and believe me, that was not an easy task...really, the absolute worst aspect of this film is the writing. Here's an example, once the rats begin killing off the characters, one woman spits out this little gem of brilliance, "The idea of being killed right now really frightens me." And here's another, as the leader of the gang prepares to flash fry a whole mess of rats with his flamethrower, "I'm going to warm their whiskers." Oh criminey...the film is filled with completely unnatural dialog, pointless interactions, accompanied by atrocious, awe inspiringly overblown performances. I swear, the actors chewed up more scenery than the rats themselves. As far as the characters go, a more irritating bunch you'll rarely see. One can't help but root for the voracious rodentia. And get the names of some of these a-holes...Duke, Video, Lucifer, Chocolate...there was one character that was particularly loathsome in that of Myrna, a leather clad woman who spent a great deal of time losing her marbles and screeching incoherently throughout the film. Here's another juicy line of idiocy, as one mook finds a bottle of booze and begins sucking it down..."Hey, what an incredible drink!"...yeah, drink up boyo, as your time is gonna come. I think the absolute worst scene for me was near the beginning, when the group found all the food and began celebrating by dumping sugar and flour all over each other, dancing about like mental deficients. The black woman, named Chocolate (nice), ends up covered in flour, and starts shouting how she's white, while doing a very loose interpretation of an Irish jig. The effects throughout weren't too bad, but mostly featured people off screen either throwing, or dumping rats onto the performers. There were a few gruesome bits, like the rat in the sleeping bag gag, and the exploding corpse piñata filled with rodents, so fans of the visceral will find something to enjoy. Now I've read where some think the awful aspects of the film are intentional in a comedic sense, and even the back of the DVD case makes statements along these lines, but I honestly believe the original intent was to try and make a serious, scary film, and once the finished product was out there, everyone assumed it to be a joke, so Mattei went along with this rather than cop to the fact he's a lousy writer....hell, that's what I would have done, if I were in his Italian loafers...I suppose it doesn't make a difference one way or another, as if you're an aficionado of rotten, sleazy, awful cinema, this one's right up your alley. As far as the directing, apparently Mattei, who started working on this film right after completing a project with Jess Franco, keeps things moving along, disjointedly, but seems to have thankfully taken few cues from that Spanish hack (seriously, ever seen Oasis of the Zombies? If so, you know what I'm talking about). Hey, at least there's a decent nekkid chick in the movie, which is nearly spoiled by a nekkid man and the appearance of his wang dang doodle. As far as the ending, I did see it coming, and despite the fact it was completely ridiculous, it was suitable for this story. Anchor Bay Entertainment provides on this DVD a very good-looking, widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic print, along with mediocre Dolby Digital 2.0 audio (some of it was really soft, in terms of the dialog, but perhaps that was for the best given the script). Special features include a lengthy theatrical trailer, a Bruno Mattei bio, an interview with Mattei titled `Hell Rats of the Living Dead' (9 minutes), and a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art included on an insert, the flipside listing the chapter stops. Cookieman108 By the way, I think plenty of rats were harmed in the making of this film...also, if you're interested in buying this DVD, I'd suggest doing what I did and buying the Anchor Bay DVD Fright Pack: Man's Worst Friends, which features six films including Parasite (1982), Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat (1989), Slugs: The Movie (1988), Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror (1984), Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), and Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971). It's available here on the Amazon website, at a really good price, and cheaper than buying the individual releases.
0	Terrible, but still fun OK, this movie stinks! Now that we have cleared that up, let's take a look at why this movie should be watched. Our story is about a post-apocalyptic world, in which the human race is forced to live undewrground; in order to avoid contact with the radation that has killed life. As time goes on, two groups of survivors formed and did not get along. So, group 1 up and left and made for the Earth's surface again. This is where our movie starts. The group is a bunch of bikers and look like they came straight out of LA, CA 1980. As they are settling in, the discover that there is some sort of ultra-smart, ultra-fast, ultra-carnivous species of Rats on Earth and there are large numbers of them. Very cheesey and not worth more that $9.50 or $10, but definatly worth watching. And, to all those weiners about these being real rats, get over it! There is this perfectly legal profession in the UNited States that I'm sure you would call for assistance if you had a rat problem.....We call them exterminators.....what's the difference?
0	Horrible Audio! I could not really enjoy the film. I purchased it recently on VHS and the audio quality was horrendous. I don't think anything was ever done to remaster the audio, and it is very annoying to follow. Don't waste $19.95 on it. Watch it on TCM; even there the audio is distorted. I only got it because it is a very early Irene Dunne movie, and I was curious to watch it
0	Did I ever tell you about the time I invented snowboarding? Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous "raunch" button to be successful. It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement. While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold. Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably. One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try. Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture. Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise. That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity. Why do we, as audience members, do that? Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor? While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters. I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed. I have to get this first one out in the open. Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film? The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish. Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre. Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like "This movie is just like Out Cold". This makes me so angry. If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, "Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca", instead of the other way around. Casablanca needs to come first. With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters. Were there any? Great question! I didn't see any. Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations. There were no definitions to anyone. Sure, one could argue that there were some "characters" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clichés, not characters. Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest. Nothing of the sort happened here. Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois. Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off. Again, there was nothing of value. Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film. If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth. He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers. He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead. Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience. As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter. The entire "King of the Mountain" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners. Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain. The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk. The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face. It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short. Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom. Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public. I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it. It is as if most directors are just using the "cut & paste" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring. Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular. I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again. Grade: ** out of ****
1	A great help WOW what a great DVD! I liked the show segmets the best and it was a big help planing our vacation, I never knew that there was so much to do in Las Vegas now. I thought the program flowed well and had a really good chaper index to quickly review the parts we wanted to see again. This looked just like someting you would see on the travel channel
0	hardly the noir classic id been led to believe poor ray milland gets caught up in a wacko murder plot and illicit love affair in this overrated film noir from director john farrow, who is best remembered for directing second-rate movies and siring a second-rate actress. even charles laughton is dull here!
1	Great Show This is one of the shows I watched when I was younger, its so good to be able to see them again, the bad thing is that it doesnt come with spanish audio
1	THIS IS NOT THE MGM VERSION REVIEWED BELOW! This "Robobox" is not the MGM version reviewed below. It doesn't have any of the extras, it's just the movies. Still great movies, though
0	Another sequel..... Not much really needs to be said but, I'm sure you are all asking the same question as I am...When is Michael going to die! I love the original Halloween movies but come on kill him already and end this series before you screw it up anymore. The same goes for Friday the 13th I mean Jason X with Jason...in space?! Jason needs to die, Mike Myers needs to die and Freddy Krueger needs to die. We love the old movies but please stop reviving them somehow just let them die
1	Good... for what it is. Titan AE is a really good scifi movie. It has fantastic visuals, chases, and a good enough story to keep you interested. The voice acting is also pretty good. Unfortunately the movie suffers from what many movies, especially in this genre, suffer from. They don't commit to an adult or child-based audience, nor do that go after strictly a scifi audience or a more general audience. So what ends up happening is you get just enough of both, without fully focusing on one target audience, kind of sterile, but still good. If you are looking for mind blowing concepts and something other than 'standard scifi fare' this isn't where to look. If you want a good movie that keeps you entertained and that the kids can watch too, this is a great flick.
1	I'd Give It 100 Stars if i could! This film brought me to tears. Nights of Cabiria is the first film I've seen from this brilliant Italien director. Cabiria is such an enduring character that will always be remembered for her innocence, spunk, and most importantly, her defiant spirit after going through so much humiliation by scumbags who took advantage of her golden heart. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE.
0	Desperate Acts I won't give a long drawn out account on why this movie was bad for me, but one thing sticks out in my mind. The characters tried too hard to me. I love Sanna Latham, but it seems like she was forcing herself to convince us that she was really romantically involved with Wesley Snipes. With all the ups and downs of their relationship, I was praying that they just chalk the relationship up as a loss and move on. After awhile it just get tiring ,you know, like a real relationship. I much prefer the book. This movie doesn't hold a candle to the book. The book is as real as it gets. Pretty much how things are today
1	POWERFULLY COOL HIGH BUDGET OLD SCHOOL ACTION-PACKED Anime!!!!!!!!!!!! A COOL FANTASY ACTION THAT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!!!!!! Maybe not FAST as Dragon Ball but is SOO HIGH BUDGET!!! I mean... The animation is SUPERB ***** (the moves, destruction and fights were very realistic), the character desing is soo COLORFUL (just as seen in the cover), the graphics are pretty realistic, GOOD story but very simple, bad english dub but not THAT bad, COOL song at the ending credits and the camera moves were AWESOME!! I said that this anime is like Dragon Ball because there are to many "HADUKENS", jumps that make look like the characters are flying and the story about the bad guy that want the ultimate power to conquer the wolrd but the good guys also can have the ulmate power to protect the world. But this anime is not THAT similar to Dragon Ball. I like the concept of the characters... I mean... each character have a diferent power, one with a cool spirit sword, other with a power whip, other with "haduken" and the last one with the control of a giant power dragon!!! obiously this anime concentrate more on the action and not much with the story. I never saw the serie, so I don't care what people say about the comparison to the serie. P.S: This anime is like PG-13 style or a Saturday Morning Cartoon but don't worry!! you will be SOOO entertained that you won't care. Adios.
1	AWESOME!!!! I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS A OSCAR WINNER! NOTHING CHANGED BUT THE VOICES!BUT WHO CARES, THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED!I ALSO LOVE THE PLOT. EVEN THOUGH THE BEGINNING WAS BORING. BESIDE THE FACT THAT BOTAN GOT ZAPPED BY LIGHTING!ALSO THAT THEY ADDED MORE CHARACTERS,I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME!OVERALL IT WAS GREAT!!!!
1	wow i loved this movie it is great funny the animation war great great for every on
0	Jason Robards at his worst. One of the curiosities of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" is that the main character is not "Julius Caesar", who is killed early in the play, nor Marc Antony, who has by far the best and most famous speech - "Friends,Romans, countrymen, ...". The central character is Brutus, the "noblest Roman of them all", who must balance his his duty toward Rome against his loyalty to Caesar. Brutus is a follower of the Stoic philosophy and so tries to achieve virtue by using his reason to choose and follow noble goals, rather than being lead by his emotions. It seems that the director of this movie seeks to convey this idea by having Jason Robards, a highly skilled actor, deliver all Brutus's lines in a bored flat undertone. I wonder how they persuaded him to do it? "Don't act Jason. Trust us. Just read the lines off slowly like you never saw them before and you don't care a pin. It'll be great.!" To say this completely spoils the movie is an understatement. Mr. Spock has a wider emotional range. They would have done better and saved money by having Brutus played by a flashing blue light and the guy who did the voice of the HAL 9000. When Brutus is off screen the movie is fine. Heston is surprisingly good. Gielgud is great. It is sort of a pity that the movie is in color because it makes it harder to ignore the poor costumes, the cheap sets, the worst fake beard in the history of cinema. If you want to see a much better film version, there is the classic black and white version in whcih James Mason and Sir John Gielgud make a superb pair as Brutus and Casius, and Marlon Brando gives a chilling Antony. As for this one, if someone gives it to you as a present, by all means look at it first before you donate it to the public library
0	maybe now haters will appreciate "Darkness Falls" Hunky guys, pretty women, and even scream queen PJ Soles (who is strictly in here just for her name, because she's useless) can't save this one. Using the same exact legend of that was the basis for Darkness Falls, this film gets worse and worse as it moves along, after a really creepy intro. The acting is terrible, and the bottom line is, the "spirit" of tooth fairy goes around killing people using modern day power equipment, like wood chippers and nail guns. There's nothing scary or atmospheric about it. The only thing it has going for it is a couple of good gore scenes. Seriously, if you're going to steal an idea from a movie that was panned by critics and horror fans, seems like it would be a snap to make it tens times better. I'll stick to Darkness Falls and it's creepy atmosphere
1	Played more for laughs Unlike Sorcerer Hunters where the humor plays around the edges of the plot, this one seems like the gags were dreamed up first. My almost 12-yr-old wanted this one for months before I bought it. There's a lot of familiar voice actors(ADV studio-Andrew Klimko/Sorcerer Hunters-Gateau) & Kelly Manison/S.H.-Big Mama, Martian Successor Nadesico-Haruka, Excel-Great Will of the Macroverse. Japanese actors Tomokazu Seki/M.S.Nadesico-Gai Daigoji, Card Captor Sakura-Toya, X-Kamui & Kotono Mitsushi/Sailor Moon-Usagi, Excel Saga-Excel, Blue Seed-Kome. They even got DBZ's Bulma-Hiromi Tsuru on ep 12) so the whole thing comes off pretty well. I found the plot a bit thin--or maybe just a poor excuse to strip characters' clothes off almost every ep, but I did laugh quite a bit
1	Such an Interesting Documentary! John Cleese brings his signature brand of humor together with interesting and thought-provoking interviews to create such an interesting mini-series about the face - why is it beautiful (or not)? What do expressions mean? Do they mean the same thing to everyone? Who is the BEST at knowing if people tell the truth - or if they lie? What would life be like if you couldn't recognize the faces of friends? Why are facial deformities so "problematic" for societies - is it because of their elevated importance of beauty, or is there a different reason? This fascinating video will answer all these and more, leave you laughing... and actually make you SMARTER by the time its over. Support given by the undeniably beautiful and witty Elizabeth Hurley, funny man Michael Palin, and others round out the experience. I couldn't recommend this movie more
1	Good Hong Kong Police Film I would have preferred to have seen this film in it's original Mandarin language track but I do not feel it is necessary to knock this edition. I also take the unfashionable opinion that "Reservoir Dogs", Quentin Tarantino's homage(not rip-off) to "City on Fire", is the better of the two films. "Reservoir Dogs" beats this film in terms of style and characterization if not completely original. That said, this is a highly engaging film. It has a compelling central premise of a police undercover operative who not only has to fear the crooks he's infiltrating but his superiors who view him with contempt. There is action here for sure but it doesn't subvert the story. I recommend this film for any fan of Hong Kong action films but if a Mandarin edition becomes available check that out instead
1	The race begins I only began watching the Amazing Race a few years ago, in season six, I believe, so I never saw how the show got its start. This DVD gave me the chance to go back and look at where the Amazing Race began and how far the show has come in the last few years. The premise behind the Amazing Race is simple. Race around the world and the first team to cross the finish line wins one million dollars. Of course, with prize money like that, it won't be easy navigating your way around the world, but if you succeed, you get the cash. The race began (and ended) in New York City. Teams traveled through South Africa, China, India, Thailand, France and numerous other places before returning to the United States for the completion of the race. Along the way, eight teams of two were eliminated, leaving only three teams of two in the final leg. When the 11 teams of two left the starting line, they had no idea where they were going, or what they were doing. They got clues that led them to exotic destinations, places many of them had never been. It was fun to watch these Americans try to get along in another country without speaking the language. There were some great challenges in the first version of the Amazing Race. Contestants had to jump off a cliff in Africa, navigate a crowded market in India, hike a steep portion of the Great Wall of China, drive a team of dogs in Alaska, soar in a glider above Italy and more. As the years have gone on, the challenges have remained difficult, but I believe that some of the ones in the first season were among the toughest. Along the way, teams were met with Road Blocks, which were tasks that usually only one member of the team could complete, and Detours, which gave teams the chance to make a choice on which way they wanted to proceed. Often times choices made at Detours could make up valuable time or put a team behind their competitors. Teams also had the chance to use a Fast Forward. The first team to complete each Fast Forward, could skip all tasks on that leg of the race and go directly to the pit stop, which was located at the end of the leg. However, each team could only use one Fast Forward during the race and choosing when to use it was key. At the end of each leg, contestants would get a 12-hour break at the pit stop, where they could talk with other contestants and just relax and prepare for the next leg. The last team to check in at each leg was eliminated, with the exception of three legs that were non-elimination legs. In future editions, teams were penalized for coming in last at a non-elimination leg, but in the inaugural season, there were no such penalties. As the seasons have gone on, producers have tweaked the show to make it better. Some of the things in the first season that were changed included the introduction. Host Phil Keoghan would talk about what previously happened on the show and at the end, say 'who will be eliminated tonight.' However, if you listen to that intro, you can tell when nobody's going to be eliminated because he doesn't use those words but others. Now, on the intro, he says 'who will be eliminated next,' which is much better. Also, Phil would only greet the last team, which always was a tip-off to the last place finishers that they were indeed, last. Now, Phil greets every team and that makes it more dramatic for the teams. The teams in the first season were also much like the teams in every season I've watched. You have the requisite gay couple (Joe and Bill aka Team Guido), the spunky grandparents (Dave and Margaretta), the parent-child team (Nancy and the very cute Emily), the macho guy teams (Drew and Kevin, Rob and Brennan), the underdog two women teams (Pat and Brenda, Kim and Leslie) and a few young couples using the race as a gauge of their relationship (Paul and Amie, Matt and Ana, Lenny and Karen, Frank and Margarita). This formula has been used on most of the editions I have watched, though, I am not arguing with it. It seems to work. Team Guido was the team everybody loved to hate, thanks to their cockiness and sneakiness. It was tough to watch Frank and Margarita racing to the finish line, thinking they were first, when in reality, that was not the case. My favorite two teams were frat brothers Drew and Kevin and Nancy and Emily. Drew and Kevin were just a riot. They made me laugh at every turn, yelling at each other, but always managing to stay in the race until almost the end. Nancy and Emily made it farther than anyone expected them to, which is always nice to see. They fought through some difficult times, particularly in India, but came through stronger as a team. Plus, Emily was pretty darned cute. As far as extras go, this set has a lot, but the way they are set up is different. You can watch the episodes with a choice to go look at unaired footage, but you can't see the footage any other place. It would have been nice to package that another way, but it is still nice that it is included. There are four episodes of commentary, two from Rob and Brennan and Team Guido and two from Lenny and Karen and Drew and Kevin. There is also a look back at the first season with the aforementioned teams, Keoghan and the executive producers. There is a look inside the making of the first season and how difficult the logistics were. It is interesting to hear the producers talk about how they were often on the same plane as the contestants and barely steps ahead of them for much of the way. All told, this is a solid release of the very first season. It would be nice to see more seasons released. Season seven has also been released, but I would love to see seasons two through six as well
0	The Emerald Forest This movie was horrible. I am sorry I purchased it. It was like watching an old B movie with a low budget and bad acting. I got the feeling it was strictly a venue for the writer/director to view and film [...].
0	Not happy The Movie is great, but the used DVD is garbage. The DVD skips and stutters. I feel like I got taken to he cleaners
1	Another great performance by Mark Ruffalo. Overall, this movie was "ok"- it was enhanced by Mark Ruffalo's performance and while I wasn't so fond of the ending, it's still a movie worth your time to see
0	Awful I thought this movie was absolutely awful.It is one of the worst movie's I have seen in quite a while.You keep waiting for the movie to get interesting, but it never does.I don't recommend this movie, especially not to a guy, he would be bored out of his mind by this one
0	ITS OFFICIAL - BRAD PITT CANNOT ACT Ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a " cult classic" ( isnt that what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch? ) or "underated" (theres a reason it was underated -IT SUCKS). Brad Pitts performance was laughable. Watch any episode of Gunsmoke and tell me Early Grace wasnt a bad impersonation of Festus from start to finish. And that guy from the X Files ,David sumthin or other, mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film. This guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.And Juliet Lewis playing a yet another brain dead bimbo. Who woulda saw THAT one coming??? The only reason I gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat. I think its called " morbid fascination", like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away. If you want my advice ( and you probably dont) take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a Gunsmoke DVD. That way you get Festus AND you get to watch Matt Dillon beat the h*** outta somebody
0	The nostalgia is finer than the reality. I bought this out of a desire to reconnect with my childhood. Blackstar was one of those shows I warmly recall getting up early on saturday mornings to watch. Having watched the episodes again 25+ years later, I find them a little nostalgic...and more than a little annoying, to be honest. The music is ultra-cheesy, as are the sound effects, the dialogue, the animation, the characters, and the plot. On the upside, my five-year old son seems to like them, and there is a sense of satisfaction that he enjoys the same sort of thing I did when I was young. My advice, buy the DVD for children under the age of 10, but don't buy them for yourself....just cling, cling like mad to your fond childhood memories of the show
0	Amazing Cast-Weak Movie Secret Agent was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams, Bob Hoskins, Christian Bale, and Patricia Arquette among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of an Englishman, living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of London. Things, however, are not as they seem in 19th Century London, with spies, double agents, anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day... In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The movie has that Sherlock Holmes feel about it, but without the "magic," meaning that in the end you are left... numb, and wondering: "Was that it?" As for the rating, it could have been PG-13. Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really...
0	Heavy-Handed and Sluggish Conrad Adaptaion (See 'Sabotage') 'Secret Agent' (1996) stars very strong cast -- Bob Hoskins (also ex-producer), Patricia Arquatte, Christian Bale, Gerard Depardieu, Jim Broadbent, Eddie Izzard, and uncredited Robin Williams. The music score is Philip Glass, and the director is Christopher Hampton, who made 'Carrington' before this one. So the film should be better than average classic novel adaptaions, which it isn't. This Conrad adaptation is sluggish, not knowing what it really wants to show. One great disadventage is that we have seen the adaptation of this Joseph Conrad novel before -- Hitchcock's 'Sabotage' (1936) starring Sylvia Sydney. (Not to be confused with the same director's film named 'Secret Agent.') This version, not perfect to be sure, knows what it is doing, for the master of suspence turned it into a spy story with a thrilling sequence about a bomb hidden in a bag carried by an innocent boy. However, the new version, though it is more faithful to the original novel, and proud of its great cast, has no sense of what it really is doing. The film opens quite promisingly, with Bob Hoskins' Verloc, a shopkeeper in 1890s London, who actually is a spy in the pay of Russian embassy. He is summoned by the Russain ambassador (very good Eddie Izzard), who tells Verloc to demolish one symbolic building in Britain with a bomb, the building which represents 'time' (you know where). So far, interesting. But as if to imitate the original novelist's slow moving narrative, the film unwisely introduces many flashbacks that tell us the outcomes of the botched plans. Yes, Conrad uses (intentionally or not, I do not know) the confused narrative that seems to have lost the sense of coherent chronological order (read 'Nostromo'). Hampton not only employs this flashback method once, but twice (!) to show how Mrs. Verloc (miscast Arquatte) meets her fate. So irritating. The production designs are excellent, the acting is good all in all -- Jim Broadbent as police inspector and Robin Williams as The Professor around whose body a bomb is strapped are memorable among them -- and Philip Glass provides good socre. However, all is wasted or misused, and even Glass's music starts to sound repetitious. The film uses it when there is no need, and that is really annoying. I like the atmosphere, and I don't think Joseph Conrad is a difficult material to make a film out of it (see 'Victory' made the year before). But Christopher Hampton as director, though good as screenwriter, seems to have killed the material with heavy-handed direction. And its characters that should be more interesting with a smooth story, too.
0	Robbed my time Burglar is your typical D movie. It has more bads than goods. Actually, it has a ton of bads. When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't expect Oscar worthy material. But, I did expect something that would at least halfway amuse me or even keep my interest. I didn't get either of them. Yes, the acting was all right. Whoopie Goldberg is a great comedic actress, but she should really be a little choosier when it comes to picking what movies to be in. Burglar moved at a snails pace, and that is putting it lightly. There were way too many coincidences. There would just happen to be a bag with valuables in it laying around, or there would just by pure coincidence be a motorcycle with the keys in it parked in an alley practically yelling at you to be stolen. Also, the directing was terrible. The director did not explain things well at all. The only reason I stuck around to the end was because to see if my prediction of who the killer was right. And of course, I was right. The plot was paper-thin. I don't like a movie when I know the ending a quarter into the film. Overall, Burglar is a definite waste of time that now has the title of &quot;most predictable movie ever.&quot; 1 Sta
1	PANTSWETTINGLY FUNNY I gave "The Aristocrats" 1 star, as I thought it was just a pile of disgusting comments,words and images going nowhere. This Pamela Roast is a heap of disgusting comments, words and images DEFINATELY going somewhere - to your funnybone - because it is applied with wit! I don't want to spoil your fun by quoting jokes from the show, but let me just give you an example. Referring to the sextape of Pamela and Tommy, one of the roasters said :" I have not seen a p***y take such a pounding since Clay Aitken lost to Ruben Stuttard". I thought this was a hilarious ROAST, and I regularly show it to friends who then fall about laughing. I also thought Pamela handled it with grace and style, and I admire her immensely for that! If you like adult comedy, you can not go wrong with this DVD
1	Interesting Review Of Suppressed Information Commander X is the pseudonym used by a person who is reportedly a former U.S. Government intelligence agent from the NSA who worked in a remote viewing project. He has distributed a lot of information from alleged personal experiences and insider contacts to provide glimpses of what goes on behind the scenes with ETs, the Global Elite/NWO, mind control, secret technologies, and more. Probably the best part of this video is X's expressed view that we all are connected to the Creator and don't need any religion to intermediate. The video shows scenes of the speaker with his face blacked out, interspersed with a variety of video clips, photos, fractal and kaleidoscopic art, metaphysical drawings, and more. The voice is altered and it's almost a cliche that the speaker is upsetting folks in the government/NWO by sharing what he knows. Obviously, if information is classified then those who have taken an oath to serve government agencies can be dealt with in unpleasant ways for releasing what they have discovered. Thus, I think it is unusual for people like X to directly present their findings to the public unless it is being done openly as an approved leak or dissemination of confusing disinfo. The speaker here is disguised [though it would seem to me that it might not be too hard for the government to identify him and track him down]. He admits that he doesn't have all the answers and seems to be a bit more calm than some other people that have presented their ideas about ETs & NWO topics. Overall I thought this video was interesting, though I found the organization of images presented to be inadequate at times even while I really liked many of the computer generated fractal, kaleidoscopic, and hypnotic images. This video seems to present information in a more cogent and up-to-date manner than past Commander X books, so if you liked the books this video should interest you
1	"You ARE the weakest link..." This vanilla release concludes the final three episodes of the New Series of Doctor Who. Boom Town is not a fan favorite, but it does have some funny moments. While Bad Wolf and the Parting of the Ways ties the season together, starting by putting the Doctor, Rose and Capt Jack Harkness in Reality Programs in the future. The New Series looks and sounds great. Christopher eccleston makes a great Doctor, and Billie Piper is a surprisingly great fit for his Doc. 'tis a shame Eccly only wanted to do one season
1	My son loves this movie. My 5 year old son really enjoys this movie. It is perfect for his age group and even his 3 year old sister likes to watch with him.
1	Super movie for cat lovers DC is great, the neighbors are very nosey, wonderful family movie
0	Doesn't even deserve 1 Star The only resemblance Rise to Power has with the original Carlito's Way film is in name and producer Martin Bregman. The success of the original begs for a vivacious, guns-blazing Carlito Brigante prequel. Unfortunately, Martin Bregman decided to bankroll his son as the director. The result was a train wreck of a movie with horrible casting, acting, writing, directing; you name it, Michael Bregman did it... bad. Topping it all off, the plot fails to lead in to the original movie! The irony of this Michael Bregman is the similarity between him and a character in the movie - Reggie. Given the chance to inherit his older brother's powerful and profitable position, Reggie, at every turn, makes horrible decisions. At times, these decisions are made, seemingly without any sort of reason. In the same way, Michael Bregman's choices for the film are painfully disgraceful to the original Carlito's Way, and to his father... This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. For the love, stay away..
1	I had a farm in Africa..... This is one of my all time favorite movies, not just because it is a great romance, but because it is about a woman defining her own destiny, which is a theme I love. The set design and costume design perfectly capture the feeling of early twentieth century. I hate watching 'period' that are ruined by the costume,makeup, and set designers' attempt to make the antique look seem modern, Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightley is a perfect example. This is a great movie, wonderfully told. I cry every time I watch it. Recommended
0	Fake Family What do you have? A family sitting all the time in a perfectly clean house fully dressed and never, ever watching TV. They never have chores; they never have real problems, and everything is resolved in twenty minutes by a joking father. Can't stand it
0	Kingston trio reunion: a dissapointment I am a long time K.T. fan. I saw this show on PBS years ago so I bought the tape. The show was severly edited(about an hour) and the audio was poor. it is, however, the last chance to see Dave Guard and Roger Gamble, therefore it is a must
0	the way not to do a movie about a t.v. show first they cast a black man as an undercover agent in the wild west where he would never be able to help as they would never let him in most places. remember this was before political correctiness or civil rights. then they turn one of the best villins on t.v. into a racist man missing most of his body. then they add state of the art f/x and think they have a great movie. it's pure trash and gets one star because you can't give no stars. a waste and you should see the t.v. show if you want to see this concept really work well. just not good at all, a mess
1	Great Fun, Great Workout! My baby and I just love this DVD. The dances are simple to learn, but they really burn off the baby fat. There is a good variety of music which is nice if we're in a particular mood- no excuses for not exercising! I also like that there are so many songs, giving us something to build up to; my baby and I still can't quite make it through all the dances. This DVD really makes exercise challenging and fun while bonding with my new baby- exactly what every new mommy needs
0	More of the same... Rest Stop is a pretty bad straight to DVD horror flick. It's the same old "redneck rampage" style serial killer flick. But the plot is just in shambles and doesn't make much sense. Only about 20 minutes of this movie is worth seeing. By the way, you know a movie is bad when Joey Lawrence is the best actor in it. I'll give it this much... there are probably two very nasty/awesome gore scenes for the slasher fans out there
0	Could have been worse... Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006) Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks. Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on. Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. *
1	a great music video collection when prince formed NPG he took his music to another level this video expresses that!..the way each video is formed...the color, not that jumping from one scene 2 another each member gets his or her chance to show their stuff..if you are a true prince fan u got to get this video...don't be a jughead..add this one to your collection
0	Oxford is no Miracle Ok, the cover looks like a clone of Miracle with Kurt Russell and that is about the best thing this movie has going for it. West looks really young so this is probably a made for tv British film that has been repackage to ride the curtail of West recent critical acclaim on HBO's The Wire and on the success of Disney's Miracle. I didn't finish the movie because I honestly didn't care who won the boat race. Unlike Miracle which keeps you watching despite Russell's wardrobe and great looking toupee, this movie never draws you in and you just wish the boat would sink and drown the entire cast
0	Edward D Wood Jr. could make a better film $120 million this cost $120 million WITW??? Volcano is an absurd R list movie story that somehow got an A list budget and A list cast to star in it. The pitiful attempt to make a disaster movie is just a horrifying waste of talent and money. I wish this were a comedy instead of a serious movie; it's one of the funniest things I've seen all year. Where are Mike, Crow and Tom Servo when you need them? This is an MST3K movie if there ever was one. To make Volcano's boring predictable story a chimpanzee probably took the copies of screenplays of other bad disaster movies, cut out the worst scenes and then pasted them together to make the script for this movie. If there are people stupid enough to write this stuff up for real; I don't want to know about them. You must only need a room temperature IQ to be a screenwriter and make the big bucks. Schoolteachers who put in 12-15 hour days struggle to make a living and the writer of this screenplay drives a Bentley. Shows you how fair life is. According to this movie, there's a live volcano in the middle of Los Angeles. Fault lines the seismologists know about, but somehow they miss a Volcano in the middle of an ENTIRE CITY. Holding this wafer thin plot together are the cardstock disaster movie cliché characters who spout cliché lines. Tommy Lee Jones (Fresh off his Oscar win, shows you how many good roles those worthless gold statues get you.) is an overworked Los Angeles Fireman who wants to just go on vacation when the catastrophe starts. Yeah, there is one of these guys in every one of these disaster movies. The dialogue spouted in this movie will have you in stitches. Every line is a ridiculous cliché and sounds extremely ridiculous. Oh yeah Anne Hecht is the blonde pretty geologist who knows all about volcanoes and schools the audience. She also has an interest in Tommy Lee. Don Cheadle is the guy who sits in an office and banters with Jones over the radio. There's the teenage daughter who constantly is getting herself in the path of danger. Keith David is the cop who does get to go outside and bark orders. This film is a laugh riot. Badly computer generated lava threatens to destroy all those beautiful California landmarks. In one scene a guy is walking down a hot tunnel and his Nikes are melting; the poor guy gets engulfed in hundred thousand-degree lava and doesn't scream in agonizing pain. He's making a noble sacrifice saving lives. Everything leads up to the demolition of a brand-new office tower to cap the flow of the Volcano. Tommy Lee Jones goes to save the teenage girl from a collapsing building, that's UNDERNEATH THE LAVA and comes out alive. At the end of the movie enjoy the "Volcanic ash" that snows down in sunny California makes everyone look the same. Bleech. I read somewhere the studio spent $120 million on to make this dreck. Instead of spending all that money to make this movie, they should have paid the screenwriter twice that much to disappear and buried this screenplay deep under the La Brea Tar pits so it could never be made into a movie. But hiding this vile story there would probably lead to the tar pits vomiting up lava in the middle of LA. just like the movie. I've seen my share of bad movies and over the past ten years Hollywood somehow continues to make films WORSE than Edward D. Wood Jr could ever think of putting on celluloid in his lifetime. Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda had a more cohesive plot and better acting than Volcano. Unless you're looking for a movie to roast at your MST3K party at your house avoid this on-screen disaster.
0	Am I missing something? I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast
0	Not as good as it could be! This is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie. The main character's hair is short, then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long, then the next day it is short again. When one person gets buried in the graveyard, it is located downhill by the water. When another person gets buried in the same graveyard, it is up on top of a hill. It is very hard to concentrate on the plot, characters, etc. when this is happening all the time. But two stars for being a good story and having nice scenary
1	I have to go with an A for Effort. I've had this movie since it was first released and yes I laughed at various parts of the movie when the CGI just was so painfully obvious bad. And yes I could rip the movie apart just like you can rip any big budget Hollywood production apart, but here was a movie that did their best to stay true to Well's story. If you are a lover of the Book then I believe this is a must see movie, now if you can get over the movies flaws and enjoy it's content.... that I leave to you and I relly hope you can cuase they get an A for Effort from me.
0	Okay I was pleased to get the DVD as I have been trying to get it for teaching Greek Mythology, but I thought the actual packaging of the DVD rather poor especially for transferring to and from my class. The disc is not properly protected in my opinion
0	Worst concert DVD I own. I own about 40 various concert DVD's and must say this is about the worst of the lot. The reason - the concert footage is almost unwatchable. I can't for the life of me understand why they felt the need to change camera shots every 1 or 2 seconds (you get 3 seconds if your lucky) but that's they way they put this together. I actually counted the number of changes over the course of 1 minute during the performance of Jet and it was 51. 51 camera changes in 60 seconds of footage - you do the math on that. It's really a shame too because the concerts really seem to be excellent. Paul has a great backing band and the songs sound fresh and filled with energy. In the end it doesn't matter as it's not possible to sit down and enjoy watching it
1	More Than 5 Stars !!!!!! John Denver at his best. Every song from his heart. See John at the piano and a string section backing him up as he sings For You. I am a professional classical musician;however,this is my 'special' DVD for calm,peace and beauty. Sure miss that voice and smile. This would make a wonderful gift or add to your collection
0	borderline watchable. kinda bored...the script needs more sharpening and concentration. except the major role aidan quinn, other casts were a poor cast job expecially the cast of geoge washington. i failed to feel any emotion during the viewing and should blame the outcome to its screenplay writer
1	Jon-a-than, Jon-a-than, Jon-a-than............ The year is 2018 and there is no war and no crime. Corporations have taken the place of governments and the masses are entertained through a sport of modern-day gladiators on skates and speeding motorcycles where only the strongest may someday retire in peace. Though released in 1975, Rollerball has stood the test of time due to the forward-thinking of the writers within the sci-fi/sports realms and using the setting to describe the age-old conflict of the individual versus a corrupt society. Jonathan E - played by James Caan - is becoming bigger than the game and it is strongly suggested to him by Energy Corporation Executive Bartholomew - John Houseman - that he should retire. Jonathan E cannot bring himself to abandon his teammates & leave the game - a retirement party finds the superstar not following his script - which leads to a match that degenerates into a vicious life & death struggle to be the last player standing. The game is already brutal enough before the last game - played on a track, with the object to place a metal ball into a cylinder to score points - as teams named for major cities actually compete for corporations. The action sequences are brilliant and the drama of the last game is chilling. And that contest ultimately brings - on the track, at least - victory without a real winner.
0	This should have been a story of human triumph... The film is well crafted, but I do take issue with the racial tones of the storyline. Stop making 'race' an excuse. People get out of life what they put into it. This should have been a story of human triumph instead of some run of the mill sociopolitical statement. There is waay too much of this happening today. My appologies to the production crew, but 1 out of 5 stars is all this movie deserves.
0	Good start turns out to be a very poor slasher Only Michael Ironside performance is worth watching. Linda Purl and William Shatner plus the lead nurse should all have been fired for their telentless performances. This movie is a waste of a good premise, less bad mugging performances more gore and suspense would have made for a better slasher movie. Avoid unless you like wasting money, so many better slasher movies than Visiting Hours. Terminal Choice is a far better example of a hospital based slasher, why could'nt Anchor Bay release that instead
1	My fave equestrain movie I saw this move about 5 years ago for the first time. I bought it as soon as I saw it on DVD. IT is such a great story and it's content as far as the eventing world goes is almost entirely accurate. It really should be rated more of a pg13 b/c of the language and some sexual content. It still is so worth buying.
0	A colorful yet disappointing attempt to capture Doyle's idea The color and CGI's are excellent in this film. The location shots are great, and the attempt to capture the late 1880's successful. However, the female character is obnoxious and certainly un- becoming in attitude, language and appearance. While this might be the 90's, and women should be able to handle strong lead characters, this woman, who was the financial backer of the expedition, was disgusting. There have been several major cinematic attempts at this story, but this version leaves a lot to be desired
0	Do not buy this DVD I bought this supposed to be UNRATED version of this movie from "mediathrill" and I felt that they cheated. They have cut all good scenes from this movie. I contacted them and they just denied their responsibility. I had seen this movie earlier, so I was very much aware of all the scenes. Please do not buy this DVD...no matter what.
0	Done me wrong! I recently purchased this movie after seeing in the past on cinemax. I bought this after seeing it was listed as unrated and directors cut, which I thought was cool it sounded great. Now unless the director is a prude this is were I was done wrong. On cinemax they showed a hell of alot more than on this DVD. This had so much heavy editing that I felt so wronged in my purchase. If anyone else feels the same join the club. The movie had some hot scenes, but after watching this version I lost the interest real quick. The movie should have at least 3 to 4 stars for its sex and nudity, but I felt wronged. The only thing I could think of is that someone messed up and put the pg-13 version in my box
1	Brilliant; brilliant; brilliant. Where this ranks in the Woody Allen opus, according to those who know, I wouldn't care to say; but for me it's the tops, up with The Purple Rose of Cairo. This is an incredibly witty and delightful work, impeccably crafted in every direction. It is deeply subtle and philosophical: there is nothing shallow about its satire. It is also extremely funny. I laughed a lot, a very lot. Maybe that supremely flat, deadpan humour, sustained to the nth degree, particularly appeals to an English sensibility. The ingenuity and accuracy of the antique filming and acting styles, and the staging of the musical numbers is astounding. Incidentally, that wasn't really Hitler at the rally, with Zelig behind him, was it? I thought that was the Hollywood version of the Zelig life story: the versions merged --- the documentary became fiction, and vice versa. Eudora's mother stole the show.
1	effective gothic style horror(just my opinion) i thought this is a really creepy movie and very hard to watch.it is filled with an air of dread and depression,but i managed to get through it.the last time i tried to watch it,i had to stop watching after 15 minutes.Louise Fletcher is terrifying as the wicked and evil grandmother.i thought the movie was very effective in the horror dept.it doesn't go into as much depth as the book,but i think that would require at least a 2 part mini series.i wouldn't recommend it if you are feeling down.also,if you are a fan of the book,keep in mind that they left alot out of the movie.other than that,i would recommend it,especially if you like gothic style horror,which is what i think this movie is.for me,"Flowers in the attic gets a 3.5/
1	Kick Toguro's @$$!!!! In these final ephisodes of the Dark Tournament Heiya beats Bui. Kowabarra defeats ederly Toguro. Now Yusuke enraged at Toguro for killing Genkei faces off with the evil demon. The fight is intense and to our hope our young hero wins! Toguro is killed by Yusukes powerful SPIRIT GUN!! I love this show, it totally rocks, there is only one faul that i might add; why doesnt Heiya of Kurama get a girl? They should fall for SOMEBODY! I mean they are my two #1 characters. Yusuke gets kakoe so give Heiya and Kurama someone PLEASE!!!Gotta go bye
1	A riveting documentary I am not a fan of Russian culture or history, but when I saw this program on the History Channel, my fingers never picked up the remote control. I never channel-surfed once. There was more drama, intrigue, action, and violence in this documentary about REAL PEOPLE than in any soap opera drama. It reminded me that nothing imagined on TV or in the movies can compare with real people and events in history
0	Yet another gutter scraping lack of quality in lesbian film! Wake up lesbians: THIS IS NOTHING LIKE Brokeback Mountain!! To begin with, the differences between this and Brokeback Mountain are too many to list. Brokeback Mountain contained some of the best acting (by Heath Ledger especially) in many years; the acting in this movie was absolutely horrible. The cinematography was fantastic in BBM, this looked like it was done by children. The dialogue in BBM was utterly brilliant; this had to have been written by someone with no imagination or connection to effective or real communication. BBM was a beautiful, honest, real love story told with unequaled poignancy; this told the dark story of how lesbians find death a better answer than just living a happy, productive life like most of us do. Whoever thought this to be even remotely good is a victim of accepting the crap that is tossed out there rendering ridiculous depictions of lesbians and lesbian life. UGH, and suicide??? NEXT TOPIC! Just because a film has a low budget doesn't necessarily mean low quality! This is a far too typical stinker of a lesbian film made as an excuse to show girls kissing and show yet another SKEWED image of how we live.
1	The Batman I am going to give The Batman, Season 3, a rating of 4 stars, based primarily on the continuing improvement seen in seasons one and two with respect to certain aspects of the original Batman-The Animated Series, but downgraded from the five star seasons one and two, due to increasing reliance on Robin and Batgirl. Because of the obvious confusion in the series titles, I will refer to the Batman animated series from the 1990's as Batman-The Animated Series and I will refer to the current one as The Batman. I own and have viewed all four editions of the original 1990's animated classic, Batman--The Animated Series and like many, at first I was somewhat put off by The Batman's new animation style. Batman-The Animated Series was groundbreaking in many ways and had an original look and feel. Nevertheless, this new version grows on you and there is much of value here, indeed, some things here are even superior to Batman-The Animated Series. The animation style here has overtones of the Japanese anime style but nowhere near as much as has been incorporated into the Cartoon Network's Teen Titans, whose look I detest. In fact, given the tragedies of the look of the Teen Titans and the recent computer animations done of the Fantastic Four on the Cartoon Network, and Spider-man on MTV, The Batman looks traditional and sensational by comparison. Furthermore, for me, the Batman in Batman-The Animated Series was drawn too much with a brawny Space Ghost/Gothic look, inspired by Frank Miller and the first Batman movie from 1989. The costume in Batman-The Animated Series returned to the original Batman costume with all dark tones, from the 1940's. If you are in your 30's or 40's as I am, this is not what the Batman that we grew up with looked like. The 1970's Batman generally was leaner and more athletic looking, and had the costume that I prefer, with the round yellow bat insignia. The Batman retains this classic 1970's look. The premise of The Batman is that this is the Batman in his early years of crimefighting, and accounting for his youth, I believe that the overall look here is more consistent with the way Batman was drawn in the 70's by Adams, Giordano, Rogers and others, perhaps in order to fit more with the new Batman of the movie, Batman Begins. At least in the first two seasons of The Batman, this Batman is both a loner who works by himself, and a vigilante sought by the police. I find this more realistic than having, as in Batman-The Animated Series, the Police essentially deputize Batman and having Batman fight crime with child sidekicks--although Robin and Batgirl are to come in this series as well. The other thing that I am beginning to really like about this series is the fresh look at many of the villains that it is taking. The Joker is still recognizably the Joker--I asked my three-year-old sons to verify this--but he has a different and bizarre look. The same is truth for many of the other stalwarts: the Riddler, the Penguin, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, etc. Like its predecessor, The Batman continues with the annoying trait of far too many Joker episodes--really, can't they improve security at Arkham Asylum at all?--as well as too many of the other before-mentioned villains who are beginning to become a bit tired. I would prefer to see more of the lesser-used villains like Ras and the Scarecrow. It does, however, have some excellent episodes involving Killer Croc, Man-Bat, and Solomon Grundy and another involving the Bane defeat of Batman. Hopefully, we will continue to see more of these lesser known but more interesting opponents. One thing that I have never really understood about DC is their general refusal to use famous comic book story arcs in their movies and cartoons. When it is done, as with the Ras story from Batman-The Animated Series, the results can be excellent. Marvel does this much more often, to great success but DC seems to almost always try new and inferior stories. Overall, I find The Batman less stilted and more in line with the classic DC Comics Batman of the 70's, in terms of tone, darkness and style, compared with the more self-important, taciturn and somewhat bland Batman in Batman-The Animated Series. The reason that I only give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the creators are currently going down the same road as their predecessors at the Animated Series and that means that the episodes are incorporating more and more Robin, which is arguable on the merits, and more and more of Batgirl, which is not arguable on the merits and is apt to ruin the series. Batgirl was never an essential part of the Batman comic, unlike Robin and her inclusion here is lamentable. I have heard the DC creative talent say that anytime you do a Batman show, that you get two years to do it right and then the suits at Warner Brothers come over and start asking, "where's Robin?--where's Batgirl?--we need the youth market." The first two years I would give 5 stars to each. Time will tell where this series goes from here. In my opinion, the first two seasons of The Batman were the best comic book adaptation currently going, with the possible exception of the Justice League, which is now out of production. I am hoping that the future of The Batman has some more famous comic book story arcs involving Ras, Scarecrow, or Man-Bat, but I fear that lots of the Joker, Penguin and Batgirl are in the offing. Time will tell. If you are a traditional Batman fan, I wholeheartedly recommend seasons one and two and the third season, somewhat less
1	Extrodinary This is by far one of the best workouts I have ever done. I love it because its not too strenuous but you still get a good workout. There is no jumping around, you dont need a lot of space and Leslie has a good attitude and great energy. This is well worth the money!
0	One of the worse in a while-not enough camp to make it fun. If a movie is going to be really bad, it should have some camp value added in: i.e. real humor of some kind, some excitement and unexpected events, and some good hammy dialog. This groaner has almost none of these things, at least to my understanding. I did watch this two times over the years, once in the theatre, and another buying this tape for 99 cents. I really do like most science fiction films I've seen in the last 40 years, including many critical failures and campy low budget and high budget films. So I am qualified to submit an opinion. Lost is Space does have some entertainment value for kids. It is just OK, if you can turn down your IQ rather drastically and lower expectations also. I was able to do both a little the second time, and enjoyed it somewhat. In the theatre, I ended up walking out before the ending. This is the only time I have done this because of a movie. (One other time I did because of an audience laughing at some torture scenes, but that is another story.) Both times I saw this, the first part really seems like it is supposed to be a video game, and there is some expectation or question of when is the movie going to start? The problem is, it never does. Saying the story has not much revelance has become a cliche for movie reviewers who don't have enough to support their arguments, but in this case it is very true. Nearly every twist and turn of this story (there are a lot for such a bad movie), causes the story to worsen. So by the end, when the story has no ending, one really doesn't care at all. Knowing that a needed sequel never got made gives one a feeling of justice in the universe
0	Elizabeth Hurley topless is all this movie has going for it. The only reason why I think this "movie" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film. Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal. Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting. It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way. Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet
0	One for the garbage can... If you are a Blackmore fan stay away from this piece of crap because during the guitar solos all you will see is Gillan shaking his butt or "playing" the congas and everybody else except, of course, the guitar work. I couldn't bear it anymore in the middle of Child in Time and will certainly not check the rest of this mess. On another level, I am just appaled by the extremely poor musicianship of Jon Lord! This guy just Stinks so bad that even I could take him on the Hammond; I'm a guitarist by trade. Heck, even Blackmore is very ordinary from what I've se...heard. Can't say anything about Glover because you can't hear what he's playing. So the only high points of this video, as far as I could stand it, is Ian Paice's performance which is excellent as usual and Gillan's incredible voice. A very sad thing because DP was my favorite band and one of the major reasons I took up the guitar in '69. I can certainly live with the bad sound and picture considering the time that the show took place but absolutely not the crappy playing. This one is NO keeper and I simply threw it away, but if you really want to see DP at it's best go for the Concerto For Group and Orchestra DVD, with the Royal Symphony Orchestra, but there again you won't see much of Blackmore's work but the musicianship is way better
0	WHY? What were they trying to do? I mean c'mon either they were stupid and bought a crappy camera and got really really bad actors, and they try to remake some of the scenes, oh my god. This movie sucks its at the bottom of my movie list. I rather lick the seat of a toilet in a public bathroom than watch this movie again. It is nothing I repeat NOTHING compared to the awsome american hit classic movie Maximum Overdrive ***** 5 STARS, OH YEAH!!
0	Entertaining but not authoritative The two stars are for the entertainment value of this series. There's no doubt that Penn and Teller can put on a show. However, this series proves very little. They employ the same techniques they blast as B.S. to make their points: questionable "experts", misdirection, and even petty name calling. I have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are B.S., but to say that Penn and Teller "prove" them wrong is stretching it. If you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility, watch this series. If you want to see well thought-out, unbiased skepticism, this isn't it.
1	The Demonic Genius of the Artist Bruno Nuytten's film on the life and times of Camille Claudel (Isabelle Adjani) and her mentor/lover Auguste Rodin (Gerard Depardieu.) A well directed film that follows the female artist's humble beginnings as Rodin's assistant and lover to her later achievements as a great sculptress and artist. The film focuses on Camille's development as a character rather than being a shallow biographical film of her work. The film explores her relationship with Rodin and how his infidelities led her to feel used and abandoned. The film shows how her parting with Rodin opened the doors of her creativity and talent as a sculptress in her own right. The film closely associates her genius as an artist with her mental disintegration until she is confined to a mental asylum in the later part of her life. This is a great film and both Adjani and Depardieu play their roles very well. The film is a careful psychological study of both artists and what inspired their talents in making such great works of art. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in art, history, or just good drama
1	A very enjoyable performance of a lesser known opera Although there are no show stopping arias that the viewer will remember, the music is very pleasant and full of melody, and the performance is excellent. If you are looking to broaden your collection to include more than the standard operas such as Boheme, Aida, etc, this light comedy is a very good choice. Not only do the singers sing and act their parts well, but they also look their parts (which is frequently not the case in opera)
0	Comedic One Minute, Insulting the Next I never thought movie criminals could be dumber than the ones in "Dead Presidents," but the kidnapping-for-drug-money plan in this movie was absolutely worse. As soon as I saw where this movie was going, I just shook my head and watched the idiots go (I'm talking about the characters--not the REAL actors). This movie was pretty silly to me. Timberlake was an absolutely terrible thug, and two people had forewarned me of this, but I figured I'd see for myself. Every time I heard him curse and glanced at his tattoos, I laughed louder. His friends were even more entertaining; a bunch of suburban kids who thought being kidnapped was cool; a guy so high out of his mind that he didn't realize up from down; and the ransom kid who was so excited to be in a "criminal" scene that he completely seemed to forget he was in danger. I don't know where the movie stores will put this one when it comes out on sale, but it really should go into the comedy section. The scene where they go "buddy, buddy, buddy" made my stomach hurt from laughing at that goofiness. I'm sure that'll be copied off of in high schools everywhere. The thing is that the actual plot of the story (with different actors and without the druggies) would've been great; but the people who played the roles were absolutely so out of touch to the point where it looked like I was watching a Vanilla Ice video, or something close to it. I would've given it more stars if the movie was meant to be a parody on drug dealing, but from the previews, it sounds like the company was going for a drama. Cons: I could've gone without hearing the constant racial slurs in this movie. It annoys me when people of the culture say it; so it definitely annoyed the hell out of me to hear several characters use certain words. I didn't find that at all funny.
1	JEANNE CRAIN IS PINKY! While I would have preferred Dorothy Dandridge or Lena Horne to have payed the titled lead in this interracial romance,produced any released by Fox in 1949, Jeanne Crain does an excellent job of portraying "Pinky" Johnson,a Mississippi "colored" girl,who up north(boston) "passes" for white and falls in love with white doctor William Lundigan,who does a fine job,in a not realized role.3 Ethel Waters as Pinkys' granmother and Ethel Barrymore as a family friend do excellent work as do Frederick O' Neal,Nina Mae McKinney,in smaller, but important roles.3 Elia Kazen,not one of my favorites,for a number of reasons,directed after John Ford was taken ill(actually fired?) and had to leave the production,Kazen did not care for Jeannes' performance.Dudley Nichols(fired because he would not change his downbeat ending) and Phillip Dunne(How Green Was My Valley) wrote the screenplay. I don't like to use the term "colored",but thats' how Pinky is repeattedly referred to in the film.Maybe 4 and 1/2 stars is a better rating,also Jeanne and both Ethels received AA nominations
0	Bad Movie But DVD Is Improved This Batman movie is one of the worst Batman movies. Although The movie suffers from a super silly feel, I still think it might be better than the melodramatic Batman Begins. Val Kilmar is the worst Batman ever. Not bad special effects in this 90's movie. The Batman franchise died with this movie. The only two good batman movies are Batman and Batman Returns. Although this movie stinks, it has good special features. Music videos, making of docs, interviews, dleted scenes: it has all the works. I would pick it up only if you are a huge Batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise I would just save my money
1	For kids of all ages Don Knotts is a classic. As hokey as this movie may be, it is great for the whole family. It brought back some of my youth, (not a lot, but some).The use of the live action and animation was well done. The DVD quality was excellent.
0	Dont bother buying it If you like crummy productions with scarred and silicone filled breasts, buy it. If you want to see real yoga adepts doing real yoga - this aint it! The women couldn't do Tai Chi or yoga if their life depended on it. A real hilarious video, buy it if you feel depressed and want to laugh real hard..
1	Honor Blackman? No, the EXQUISITE Honor Blackman! Watching Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale makes one thing clear: I was born a half-century too late. Why can't I find a girl like that? Anyway, this set of early Avengers episodes is really most valuable (to me) because it's the genesis of the Cathy Gale years, which is where the Avengers begin for me. The episodes are certainly crude compared to later episodes during the Emma Peel years, but they nonetheless possess their own raw power that the more polished shows somehow lacked. The lack of retakes gives the acting a rough, natural edge that serves the more serious (by Avengers standards) scripts quite well. For fans of the later, more famous Avengers episodes, these early shows can serve as both an embellishment of the Avengers' quirky sense of adventure and a counterpoint to the more whimsical nature of latter years. Recommended
1	Great Movie I just love Thailand!!! I've been to all the locations the movie was shot at, which gives it that much more appeal and familiarity! A star gets taken away for the obvious movie mistakes. When will they learn machine guns DO NOT have unlimited rounds, and they are not double action and click multiple times after the rounds have finished. An M16 expends its 30rd mag in less than 2 secs at full auto - same for the AK-47. The amount of violence was superb
0	The best part is watching the cliches fight for dominance This movie goes way off the unintentional comedy scale. A rag-tag group of survivors, containing every possible patented Hollywood character, from the dignified elderly to the know-it-all WASP and the fiesty token minority, are subjected to a truly hilarious disaster that makes the Poseidon Adventure look like Citizen Kane. My favorite part of this film is the invincible dog. You can always tell a Hollywood hackjob by the invincible dog, which always survives everything and is, gosh, just so darn *cute* that you're supposed to get all weepy with relief when it survives through to the credits. A classic example is the golden retriever in Independence Day that, in an awe-inspiring display of poor blue screening, somehow jumps out of the way of a fireball that just destroyed Los Angeles..and of course just at the last moment. A cousin of that redoubtable pup is found here, where it actually disappears for half the movie and then suddenly comes paddling out of nowhere in a moment that is clearly intended to be triumphant, but is just flat out funny. It's long been known that people watching a movie react far more emotionally to injuries to dogs than to people, but you've stooped pretty darn low when you have to fall back on that as a plot device
1	woow coverdale and all the others... thank you so much... you took me back to 23 years ago when I was a student in the university... there were no compact disc those days... i used listen you guys my cassette player over and over and over.... the best concert song "ain`t no love in the heart of the city"...
0	Style over substance This DVD is the perfect example of misjudged style over substance. The concert is well shot in high definition, the direction is slick and the performance is very professional, but the overall experience leaves me absolutely cold. Compare this to something like the wonderful Deep Purple at the California Jam DVD, which has grainy video and sound from an original mono recording, and you will see that with all the fantastic technical advances in the world, style can never overcome substance. And ultimately, this particular Whitesnake incarnation seems to offer very little in the way of substance. The band members themselves are indisputably technically gifted musicians - but you just can't help feel that all they effectively are is a band of hired-hands who learned their craft from watching MTV in the early 80's. This is no doubt unfair and I am sure they are very nice chaps, but in this setting they just come across as extras supporting Coverdale, in the same way as Miss Kitaen and the Jag did in 1987. As for David Coverdale, this is painful...no...excruciating to watch. I have long been of the opinion that this man possesses the greatest voice in the whole of popular music - never mind just rock. When singing in the right register, David Coverdale has the most wonderfully rich, soulful and charismatic voice to ever grace a rock, blues or soul song. And to be fair to Coverdale, it's not as if he has lost that beautiful rich timbre, it can still be evidenced on his last solon album, Into The Light, and indeed sounds as good as ever in the setting of some of the mellower songs. The problem Coverdale has is that he cannot sing heavy rock any more....at least not in the high pitched manner he so often attempts on this DVD. He sounds absolutely dreadful I am sorry to say. It's very sad in a way that is similar to witnessing the sorry sight of someone who has lost a limb. In Coverdale's case, it is the voice that has been amputated, and it's just awful to witness his Donald Duck like efforts at out screeching Robert Plant. Unfortunately this seems to be the direction David feels he has to go in in order to maximize his earning potential. His moves back towards integrity, evidenced on Restless Heart and Into The Light, were not commercially successful and now he seems to believe that the hair metal brand of Whitesnake, born in the late `80's, is the way to go. Judging by the delirious fans on this DVD, he may be right - at least from a financial perspective. He sounds dreadful, and surrounds himself with a cloned band of metal heroes, but at least he's satisfying the dwindling band of supporters who once made his 1987 album a multimillion seller the world over. Integrity seems to be a bloody luxury Coverdale can no longer afford.
1	funny i don't understand a lot of the criticism of the yes men by other reviewers. i mean, all the right-wing reviews are to be expected ("flaming" is what amazon's user reviews are all about isn't it?!). so, obviously, that's a given. but all the 2 and 3 star people who were like "i didn't find it funny" and "too much talking" and what not, that's what i don't get. i found the movie terribly funny. even the benign banter whilst driving around or prepping i found funny. but the scene where they present in "the suit"... man, i was almost crying it was so funny. and as for the "what's the point!?" criticisms, all i can say is: by that logic, what's the point of anything? i mean, what do you want? it's a movie? the best it can hope for is to inspire the viewer. in this case either to act, or to possibly feel like there is a little bit of hope in the world since the only audience to challenge their right-wing, lassie fare, free-unmitigated-trade-to-the-max insanity are the college kids (aka the future policy makers), and because the one time they present the more positive ideas of the left, their audience of economists (who you'd expect to hate it) all express such joy at someone finally taking a stand for what they know to be right, but never get to talk about. if this is the gauge by which you judge success or failure of what a film should do, i think it succeeds admirably. in short, i thought the yes men was very funny. on netflix (where *accurate* star ratings are helpful, not silly ones, like in this venue), i gave it 4 stars. i gave it 5 here because i want to try to offset some of the 1 star people
0	Losers' Row It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a shambling, preoccupied air of sensitivity could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossally misguided effort, was able to get the job. Sarne was one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been on acid to agree to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless and painfully twee actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing traffic in a supermarket aisle never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. If the film looks horribly amateurish, that's because it is. If there is an historical marker indicating the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein: the debasement of culture. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years. Many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other, older (and better) films. Some actually liked these clunky "comments" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them pointless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself, any intrusion would have to be considered a welcome relief. In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was not a subversive and avant guard sensibility, but a paucity of invention, the clips were inserted in a last-ditch effort to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so artistically-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were virtually nonexistent, and screenwriter David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat in a corner of the set and `thought' for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the studio brass, the producers, and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brimming skull of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each fashioned from the dozens of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye, Baby, bye-bye. As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters and poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the Lilliputian abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality, and just plain competency when compared to even the cheesiest of them. The film was doomed the day he was hired, and a very funny and original book by Gore Vidal became the jerky, manic, and supremely unfunny (except when it wasn't trying to be) Myra Breckinridge, The Meltdown.

1	The Bar Song Enough has been said about this movie already, I think, considering its overall flimsiness. It really is "ironic" fun, as someone mentioned, and only for those who are tolerant enough to handle a bit of fluff and not have a coronary about it. I thought it was pretty amusing. It helps if you're into sailing and sunny ports. Be that as it may, I am surprised that no one has commented on the "theme" song. It features quite prominently in the beginning, introducing us to the two English lasses whiling away their evenings singing badly in a sleazy Gibraltar sailor dive; and towards the end of the film, it introduces the final twist... with a vengeance. As it turned out to my delight, "You're leaving me" -- the title of aforementioned ditty -- was an almost direct translation of a song called "Porque te vas" by Jose Luis Perales, one of my favorite Spanish singer-songwriters. Great song, really! Silly performance, though. I'm almost a bit curious what JLP got out of it..
0	Another King Masterpiece Butchered I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one. Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original. This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come. That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book. Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural. Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters. They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder. Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film. Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better.

1	A Sultry Femme Fatale, Entertaining Plot, but No Depth. "Dead Reckoning" is a story told half in flashback by Captain Rip Murdock (Humphrey Bogart), a paratrooper just returned from combat in World War II. In the Southern town of Gulf City, Murdock is beaten up and on the run. Eluding his pursuers, he enters a church and tells his story to a priest so that, whatever may come, someone will know: A few days before, Murdock and a paratrooper under his command, Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince), were whisked home from Paris and put on a train to Washington, D.C., where Sgt. Drake was to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. But Drake took off while the train was stopped, and Murdock set out to find him. He followed Drake to Gulf City, where he discovered that Drake was a fugitive before he enlisted, having confessed to the murder of his girlfriend's husband. Murdock finds the girlfriend, Coral Chandler (Lizabeth Scott), in a nightclub owned by a man named Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky), who has a mysterious hold over Coral. "Dead Reckoning" is entertaining but not thematically sophisticated. The dialogue is fine, but not clever or sharp. The character writing is superficial. This isn't top-tier film noir, but it does have Humphrey Bogart's charisma and Lizabeth Scott's sultry voice and great looks. Coral Chandler is one of the most manipulative femme fatales in film noir. In fact, she is the center of the film's only discernible theme: You can't trust women. I've rarely seen a film with such an overt anti-female premise. Normally I find femme fatales to be a refreshingly unsentimental image of women. But Murdock is relentless in proclaiming women to be deceitful and castigating Coral. -And he falls under her spell anyway. So it's all very amusing. "Dead Reckoning" isn't a great film, but it's solid entertainment with high-power stars. The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2002): The print of the film is good, but not restored. There are some small white specks, but not enough to be distracting. Bonus features include "The Bogart Collection" (4 minutes), which is scrolling text about Bogart's career followed by some posters of his films. "Vintage Advertising" is 3 posters for the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean
0	Stinks to high heaven !!!!! This so called director should be sued. As a 30 something who loved the original every friday night from season 1 through 4 (before Coy and Vance).....Coy and Vance look like gods compared to the cast of blasphemous characters to a classic and timeless show. First off....why was Burt Reynolds and not Danny De Vito casted as Boss Hogg? Why not Chevy Chase instead of an overweight villain known for playing a violent middleaged nut in "Breakdown" and "Conair"...(MC Gainey)...MC... you are a very good actor in your niche...just not turning James Best's character upside down. I refused to see this in theaters and rented in (regrettably) even after hearing the derogatory reviews with an open mind.I can write a book about character mistakes and ruining the "originals"....but I'll end it by saying the following to quote "You took the name of a classic to sucker fans and boost ticket sales for what would have been a straight to video bomb if it was not titled "Dukes of Hazzard."
0	Pure Poppycock Single mom moves with her 2 daughters to an isolated property up in the mountains that she recently inherited. There, they encounter zombie kids killed off in a mining accident at the turn of the century. While the acting is somewhat decent (and the only feature of merit in this flick) everything else screams - GENERIC. Poorly paced, poorly written and completely derivative of several dozen movies you've seen before. Sadly, i've seen made -for-cable-tv cheeseball flicks on the Sci-fi channel with more appeal then this. Definitely feel free to skip this film in the After Dark collection
0	A fine cast of actors, wasted. After watching this extremely low-budget film of a tale based on the historical story of "Hamlet" it was easy to see where all the money went: to the cast members. The cast is loaded with potential. It includes Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren, Christian Bale, a youthful looking Kate Beckinsale (she has come a long, long way since this film), and a plethora of the kind of actors that make you ask, "What other movie did I see that actor in?" But the rest of the film fails to live up to this monumental promise. For much of the movie it looks and feels like a made-for-television romp through medieval times. It has a small cast of haggard-looking extras in peasant clothing, royalty that, if not for the crowns they wore, would be indistinguishable from the common herd, and some very predictable and flawed direction. The followers of the king, peasantry included, number about thirty in total and they all live in this small wooden village. The director makes the mistake of using a large amount of voice-over narration to propel the story, which by the end was whittled down to about 90 minutes of Masterpiece Theater shot in the countryside. One scene has Hamlet dashing from a buring hall, sword in hand, but when he rounds the corner of a building his sword is missing; cut to the following scene of Hamlet confronting the new king, his murderous uncle, and the sword reappears in his hand. That kind of blatantly poor film editing is unforgivable. The acting ranges from good to passable, but no amount of thespian zeal could have or did save this project from gradual diminishing returns. Except for the sighting of a schoolgirl version of Kate Beckinsale, prim and proper as all young lasses tend to be, this film is sadly a waste of time and money.
1	Highly Effective Low Budget Chiller With Great Atmosphere and Scary Zombie Characters The 1977 horror effort "Shock Waves", has been a film I have long wanted to see. After my first screening of it I can say it most definately proves the adage that a film need not necessarily have a big budget to be highly effective in creating great atmosphere with heaps of tension and sheer horror. It's story should prove irresistable to any horror lover with the visual image of sinister waterlogged Nazi Zombies rising out of their watery graves to terrorise unsuspecting holiday makers trapped on an island with a scarred former SS commander almost a guarantee of a tension filled viewing experience. I most certainly found it that way and was really surprised by just how effective this little effort was in creating just the right eerie effect. Hopping on the undead zombie bandwagon "Shock Waves", actually manages to rise above many of the cliches of this genrre which was so popular in the 1970's. Aided as it is by some truly superb under water photography, a creepy musical score which is highly effective in creating the great sense of unease and a really interesting cast including legendary horror greats Peter Cushing and John Carradine, and former child star Luke Halpin, "Shock Waves", has all the right ingredients for a highly enjoyable and at times quite disturbing horror story. Partially based on the novel "The Morning of the Magicians", the story opens with a dishevelled and disoriented young girl (Brooke Adams) being rescued from a dingy and it is her recollections of the horrific incidents she has just experienced told in flashback that make up the story. It seems she and a small group of holiday makers have taken a tour on a rundown old boat captained by a crusty old salt (John Carradine) a nd his young assistant Keith (Luke Halpin). After experiencing some strange weather changes and what appear like underwater disturbances the ship collides in the middle of the night with a strange vessel that literally appears out of nowhere and doesn't appear to have a crew. Sustaining damage the tour boat runs a ground just off the beach of a strange island. When the captain mysteriously disappears Keith takes the other passengers ashore in the dingy where they not only find the captain's body but also find that the island is deserted except for a mysterious German gentleman (Peter Cushing), who lives alone in an old hotel. It turns out he is a former SS Commander of the Nazi army who has fled to the island at the end of World War II and he warns the trespassers to leave the island immediately. As it turns out he has his own secret in that he was in charge of a daring experiemnt by the German High Command near the end of the war which saw the creation of a secret group of storm troopers called the Death Corps who were underwater breathing zombified killing machines designed to be unstoppable in battle and totally without mercy. Unfortunately the underwater disturbances have upset the death corps watery grave in the hull of the boat that the Commander had sunk them in after fleeing to the area at the end of the war and very soon they are coming ashore picking off one member of the group after another. The SS Commander himself becomes their victim and soon it is only Keith and Rose (Brooke Adams) who are left and attempt to make their escape from the sadistic zombie killers. Keith however doesn't make it after fighting off the death corp members as they attacked the dingy just as they thought they were clear of danger and then it is just Rose as the sole survivor who drifts away in the dingy awaiting to be rescued. "Shock Waves" which had a highly effective working title of "Death Corps", was the brain child of independant filmmaker Ken Wiederhorn who was also the film's writer/director and he along with producer Reuben Trane managed to work wonders on a very meagre budget of $300,000. Obtaining the services of horror greats John Carradine and Peter Cushing was a definite plus and gave this low budget effort a status it might not have otherwise enjoyed. Not much time is given towards deep character development as is usually the case in these type of efforts however both these acting greats make the most of their smallish parts. Peter Cushing in particular delivers his usual polished performance playing another variation on his Nazi characterisation complete with hideous scar right down his face. He manages in a very short screen time to really create interest in his character and as to how a Nazi SS Commander happened to end up on this island all alone. Performances by the rest of the cast are uniformily ok with younger members Luke Halpin who is still best remembered for his role in the highly successful television series "Flipper", and Brooke Adams in her major film debut being th emost prominent and doing good work in the face of the zombie onslaught. The really memorable participants in the story of course are the extremely sinister "death corps" or zombies that arise from the bottom of the ocean and begin an indiscriminate killing spree among those trapped on the island. Their horrid appearance once again is a bit of a miracle considering the films low budget and it's amazing how their google covered eyes, Nazi uniforms, and blank unfeeling expressions give them a truly frightening appearance. The scenes of them slowly emerging from the water and creeping up behind some of the cast members are truly inspired pieces of filmmaking and go a long way to increasing the fear element in the story. A major plus in "Shock Waves", considering that alot of the action takes place near water or actually in it, is the superb underwater photography by Irving Pare. His work here is excellent in firstly depicting the old submerged wreck that is home to the long dormant death corps and in the chilling shots of the zombies rising up and moving off along the ocean floor heading towards land . The location used in Florida for the site of the island despite only being a few miles from greater Miami has a suitably isolated feel to it and the sets used, whether they be the abandoned old hotel or the marshy swamps, possess a strange other worldly feel to them that really removes the story and the viewers from anything safe or identifiable. "Shock Waves", although certainly no great horror classic is a most interestign effort that is now a firm part of my horror film library. It probably would be impossible to create such a film as "Shock Waves", nowadays with such a low budget and be still able to include the performers, photgraphy and locations that it does. My only regret is that horror greats Peter Cushing and John Carradine who are both great favourites of mine didn't get to have a bigger involvement in the story and actually share some screen time together. Cushing's character in particular is a most interesting one which deserved to have been explored more however that is a minor qualm and the overall product is excellent and essential viewing for anyone who has a fascination for "zombie" oriented stories or horror efforts in general. Enjoy!
0	doesn't live up to the hype After seeing a preview in a theatre of this re-release, I was intrigued, mainly because it didn't have any of the usual '70s black action stars (Fred Williamson, Richard Roundtree, et al) in it. I though maybe this was The Great Lost Blaxploitation Film. I was wrong. It's just not that great. It's got a good plot and good intentions, but a mediocre script, some remarkably gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity (even for this genre) and atrocious acting by everybody except the two leads (who struggle valiantly but in vain) keep this on the level of a cheap made-for-TV movie. Sorry, folks, it just doesn't live up to the hype
1	Wonderful nostalgia trip I originally saw this movie when I was 10 years old and over the years remembered the wonderful dancing and songs. I was disappointed that it never seemed to turn up on TV and was delighted to be able to buy my own copy. When I saw it again recently it was even better than I had remembered it. Donald O'Connor's partnership with Vera-Ellen is enchanting - I've watched their dances over and over. And Ethel Merman lights up the screen every time she is on - her interpretation of the memorable Berlin songs, whether belted out or sweetly romantic - is, I believe, unbeatable. I now want to get all the other Merman movies. And what a shame that George Sanders' deep, rich baritone wasn't more widely heard.
0	Could've been great! I found this movie to be awful! The pace could've been kicked up, enabling the movie to flow together more cohesively. The scenes seemed to be disjointed, one minute here, the next minute there, but it didn't alleviate the drag of the story line. While it did capture the feel of the NFL, the uniforms, the people working on the sidelines, the coaches etc. the movie floundered when it attempted to get an important point across. This could've been put together so much better
1	A Differnt Bat This show just works. Solid character development and interaction, catchy tunes (the opener is fantastic), a new dark tech world of Gotham and it stays true to the history established in Batman: TAS. But what really works is how differnt it is from Batman in comics, movies, and the cartoons that began before it. Terry (the new Batman) who is still in high school becomes Batman though to Bruce he is still somewhat a sidekick like Robin or Batgirl. Really that comment doesn't describe the role Terry plays. I can best describe him as a cross between Batman, Robin, and Spider-Man (young high school version) he's dark and seeks revenge like Batman, young, adventurous and very intuitive like Robin and helpful, responsible but also often taking on too much as Spider-Man would. There is also the dynamic of family, nonexistant in previous Batman animated adventures, he has to hide what he is really doing as Batman from his friends, family and girlfriend, reminding me of Peter Parker's relationship with Mary and Aunt May. Villains are differnt too, I'm glad the creators didn't just rehash enemies from the other series, though a few carry over, we don't deal with a "Mad Hatter Beyond" or "Penguin Beyond", not that either are bad characters. Again this series works, I have been waiting for years for this show to appear on DVD. Nothing and No one can replace Batman, but Terry and this show provides a new hero that takes the name and theme of Batman with a differnt approach
1	Party Line Dances DVD This was a great video. In the past, I had bought some videos from other sources and also checked a bunch out from the library and most were not very good. They were out of date or did not have the kind of dancing we do around here. But Shawn's dance DVD was very up to date. It has the type of dancing that we often do in my location (Florida) and at the LDS church dances I attend.
1	Another Mel Brooks masterpiece I include this in my "must have" collection of comedies. Sure the humor is stupid, silly and not politically correct but it's just funnier than anything made since
0	Apathy For The Sake Of Apathy ***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** It's probably fun to make a movie about yourself -- or one that focuses closely on you -- and that is what director Solondz has done with STORYTELLING. Not only is the film divided into two nearly unintelligible segments, it is further broken down during the final section by portraying a down-on-his luck director (Paul Giamatti, THE ILLUSIONIST) who is obviously a doppelganger of Solondz himself. Overflowing with apathy, Storytelling has two distinct parts: "fiction" and "nonfiction." In fiction, which launches the film, we're introduced to Vi (Selma Blair, HELLBOY), a young New Jersey college student involved in a writing/literature class that concentrates on critique. Her boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, THE WIRE TV series) has cerebral palsy and it appears the only reason she's with him is because of her apathy toward college life and those that haunt its halls. The teacher of the class is a forbidding black man named Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom, also from THE WIRE), a Pulitzer Prize winner who's flat affect and bored demeanor heaves a heavy shadow over the class. But apathy attracts apathy in Solondz story, so Vi and Mr. Scott have a sexual encounter, if for no other reason than to slip out of their routines and into one another. There's actually some interesting dark sexual comedy here, but it quickly dissolves. Perhaps "fiction" was part nonfiction, too, as one could easily see Solondz sitting in a class, reading stories that get sledgehammer critiques. The second and final portion of Storytelling is "nonfiction." Here we find Toby Oxman (Giamatti), a man who can't seem to finish anything. But when he discovers a young kid named Scooby (Mark Webber, THE MEMORY THIEF) who mirrors Toby's own apathy toward life, the wannabe film maker believes he's found a new calling: to make a documentary about society. John Goodman (O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?) stars as Scooby's father, a big man that pushes his kids and family too hard to become his ideal nuclear family. His wife Fern (July Hagerty, AIRPLANE) is just as disinterested in life as the rest of the cast, but hides it behind a facade of smiles. The only empathetic character in the Webber household is the maid Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros, TORTILLA HEAVEN) who gets fired because she shows some interest in life. Toby Oxman films all of the Webber household people but keeps his focus on Scooby, whom he sees strictly as a character subject. That the film ends abruptly with the death of Scooby's family, and we still see no emotional response from him, only adds to the viewer's anger that there's no one in the film to care about. No protagonist that we can get behind. No angst from any of the characters. They are blobs of human flesh pooling around each other in uninteresting ways. Directing a movie about apathy has been done before; AMERICAN BEAUTY is probably the most notable of these. But the characters were multifaceted and you cared about them. Here in Storytelling, the premise seems to be filming a flick about apathy just for the sake of showing apathy
0	What a crap! Looks great but don't get trusted, this is the worst killer shark film ever! The shark looks so fake and during all the movie he only killed like 4 people and that's it. So please don't see this movie I'm warning you
1	Great fun Good heavens, where do they get these 'essential' Amazon reviews anyway? Sheesh. Nothing like a good dose of pomposity to motivate a reply. This movie isn't supposed to be taken remotely seriously, please. It's a goof--and a very skillful one. Sure, the plot's a mismash of twice-reheated devices, the baddies are about as subtle as week-old meat, and to watch at all requires you suspend enough disbelief to reconsider the Easter Bunny as gospel. So what? You don't go to movies like Lethal Weapon for the depth of characterization. Yes, a bit helps, but... not too much. Same holds true here. It's easy to ridicule--but it's easier to enjoy. Movies like Long Kiss Goodnight are made or broken by virtue of their scriptwriting, and the script for LKG can more than hold its head up alongside other genre staples. A good script determines how willing an audience is not only to watch a movie--but rewatch it. (And buy it, for that matter.) Long Kiss Goodnight offeres a lot of pleasure in this department, it's got more quoteable lines than Die Hard and--yeah, let's be frank: the lead's hotter. (A perhaps more up-to-date comparison for tone would be Speed.) The crux of the arguments over the film's virtues, however, is & I suspect will remain whether you buy--or want to buy into--the idea of doing this kind of film as a girl-thing in the first place. (Like anyone questions the validity of the premises behind James Bond movies? Come on. This is really very simple: if you enjoy films where women kick @**, you'll very likely enjoy this. If the mere idea makes your lips purse with disapproval, skip it & move on.) Not to mention--what better place to subvert expectations than at the movies? Though the script may be better than usual, what really sells the film is Davis & Jackson--they have killer chemistry. Their scenes are filled with some terrific lines, but more than that, it's about delivery; they parry quips and insults with a good-natured banter that goes beyond making even the implausible character of Samantha almost believable: it's just plain fun watching two actors at the top of their game play off each other. No reason to turn up one's nose at A-grade actors in B-grade movies; I seem to recall some truckers-in-space thing years ago... Alien, was it? The movie loses a bit of momentum towards the end when it makes a feeble pass at Message, but that's easy to shrug off--the editing's otherwise tight and the pace is just what it should be, fast with breathing spots. The special effects work. Because the film's pretty retro in terms of plot & setting it generally hasn't dated much, and the buddy-twist here is a much-needed change from the usual guyfests. Last, the soundtrack is excellent, I'm always amazed when a wise choice can bring something like She's Not There back from the dead. The only shame is that the album soundtrack lacks a lot of the best selections from the film, which demonstrates much taste in southern blues. Finally: Ok, yes. That thing with the shot glass? too cool
0	no draft dodger here! John Wayne was no draft dodger as one of the previous reviewer(moron) stated: As Wikipedia states: Wayne was 34 when the U.S. entered the war and was raising four children, and when he requested deferment he was granted a 3-A deferment for family reasons. Later in the war his deferment was changed to a 2-A deferment with the explanation that having him serve was not in the national interest. Despite not serving, Wayne did support the military through participation in USO shows for U.S. servicemen. I guess it would have been better if we had let the government take care of his children if he would have perished in WWII? My grandfather also didn't server in WWII because he had three children to raise including my father.
1	More Average Episodes From the Worst Season! The Birth of the Highlander! Having reached this stage of the 3rd and final season of Classic Trek, I find myself wishing someone would put this dying horse to sleep out of mercy. It was truly heart-wrenching for this fan of TOS to have to make myself watch through the entire 3rd season with its many ups and far too many more downs while remembering the great acting, scriptwriting and overall quality of the first two seasons and here in what would be the 3rd last volume of the 3rd season, we get two average quality episodes. For the first episode, "The Way to Eden", one has to put the episode and hence the story into the context of the times i.e. 1969. Obviously, taken in today's context the episode is ridiculously bad but for an audience in 1969, the plot has deep meaning what with the civil rights movement and the growing dissension against the Vietnam War, that audience could definitely relate to this parable of those very troubling events of their time. Viewed from that context, I think this is actually not too bad an episode which tries to show the points of view of the various parties involved: the demonstrators (Adam and the rest), the sympathisers (Spock) and the non-sympathisers (Scott and Kirk). I thought taken as an overall episode, this metaphor of the major civil demonstrations of the late 60's was very good. The moral is that one should fight for what is right but one should also beware of being made a tool for someone else's agenda who may not have as pure an intention as you. So why do I still rate this average? Because, I too didn't like the far too frequent outbreaks of pop ditties ala Love or The Zombies that Adam breaks into. Still, an average episode overall. For the second episode, there were some pluses and some minuses as well. The plot that sounds a lot like the idea from which the whole "Highlander" series came about is a good one but what I don't understand is why Daly's character becomes jealous of Kirk and an android! Also, just because a man is immortal why does that automatically make him have to be the greatest geniuses of history? This is why the "Highlander" series that this episode spawned is far more believable for me; that individual was just a normal immortal trying hard to suppress his immortality to avoid persecution and not Einstein or Newton or my Grandpa. Still, for giving us the whole "Highlander" premise, this makes it to the average category of me. Overall, this volume falls under the "nice to have but not essential" category if you are deciding which volumes to keep
1	Chilling documentary of corporations altering the foods we eat at the genetic level... Horrifying! It has never been legal or ethical to own forms of life by patent until corporations began altering the foods we eat at the genetic level. Chilling documentary. Unappetizing display of greed run amok
1	Love Ain't No Hepburn! Jennifer Love Hewitt is clearly not Audrey Hepburn, she doesn't even come close, but, I will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-TV-movie. It takes us from Audrey's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of Breakfast At Tiffany's. It really is a pleasant film to watch. Although the script can be slow at times, I feel that it honors Audrey's memory. Even her son approved of this biography. Ultimately, I'd like to say to those who bash Ms. Hewitt for starring in this bio-pic, I'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce Audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise. I give this movie four stars because of Emmy Rossum's incredible talents. I wish her and Ms. Hewitt many more successes
1	GEORGE REEVES STILL FLYING ABOVE THE REST THE 2ND INSTALLMENT OF THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE 1ST SEASON. IF YOU LIKE THE OLD DAYS WHEN LIFE WAS MUCH SIMPLER, START COLLECTING THIS ENTIRE SERIES. GREAT FEATURES, INTERVIEWS, CRISP, BRIGHT PICTURE IN GLORIOUS B&W
1	STUNNING! I will not go into a synopsis of the material as that is readily available but will comment on the series itself having viewed them all. This is a stunning collection of the early work of the `boys` and is presented from restored 35mm material much of which is taken from the original surviving negatives. Several of the titles in the series, have until fairly recently, been considered lost forever. Each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc (again recently discovered) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack. Even for those who don`t normally view `silent` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen. Each disc deserves five stars for content, quality and value.
0	Disappointing. Wasted Potential. I love Indy films and try to support them whenever I can. I heard about this film after it showed at an Indy fest in New York. The reviews I read were good, so when it was released on DVD I bought it. Now, I am selling it. This film was very disappointing as it raised provocative issues, but basically glossed over them. The racial issues in the restaurant weren't thoroughly explored. Also, the character development of the workers was lacking. Interesting characters were introduced but never fully developed. The director and writer seemed to be going for the sappy, PC slant and that ruined what could have been a thought provoking, honest view of the complexity of racial issues in modern society. Another thing worth noting is that several scenes and lines of dialogue were edited out [deleted] from the DVD version of this film. The extras include deleted scenes but not the specific scenes of which I am speaking. One of the main reasons I purchased the DVD was because of the scene between Chris [Brody] and Leslie [Hill], but several lines of that scene were deleted. The director's commentary even states that they wanted to make the theme more human and less black and white or racial. It is obvious that this was their intent and it ruined the film. The final scene is just plain lame. The director stated that ending a film is the hardest thing to do and he proved it! There were some scenes/lines, but too few to recommend this film
1	Sweet Romp &quot;Monkey Business&quot; looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later. The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined. The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout. Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here. She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation. Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth. His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks! Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth. If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings. Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game. Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO. Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films. This is a great little piece of cinematic history. Turn back the clock &amp; enjoy
1	Excellent series, horrible DVD I thuroughly enjoyed this series when it aired way back when, and it has, if anything, improved over the years. Outstanding acting and performances, as well as superb writing that the Hollywood can't seem to craft. I have nothing but praise for this series. The DVD authors, however, have much to answer for. Absolutely no effort has been made to clean up the video during transfer. Some of the footage is absolutely dirty (and that from someone who usually doesn't notice audio or video glitches). What imbecile put a 5-minute advertisement for the company's other DVD offerings and disables the "skip" and "menu" functions. THe only way to get past these advertisements is to play them at whatever fast-forward speed your DVD player has. Special features are not worth mentioning, and subtitles are non-existant

1	unique This movie has depictured afterlife in a realistic way, it was very helpful for me since I was looking for a movie to watch and relax when my father passed away, I felt very relaxed specialy in the first half of the filmwhen it was about r.williams' being transfered and living in other dimension
1	STOP THE HATIN REVIEWERS/Give it where its due I personally thought that Stomp the Yard was a great Movie Everything about it was great. It so sad to see that people can never give credit where it due. Stomp the Yard was a good movie i mean what more could you expect from the title. It did remind you of other movies like Drumline, You got Searved and Maybe even Step up but you cant look at those and expect to get the same thing out of it or even talk bad on because it wasnt what you WANTED to be. To me the movie touched in to a little bit of everything romance, talent history,college and being new to something and showing what you got and also made a point about learning lessons. As far as the comment from Betty Burks I disagree with everything that was said because all of it was negative My advice would be to grow up and get up to dated we are no longer living in the old days so there was no need to compare the movie to people you felt like have already done things that ewere done in the movie. And the statment about Violence come on where was that at I really missed that part and if I didnt and wasnt Violence in the movie to state that comment itjust showed how some kids with talent react to certain situations A nick name is something that sticks with you and matches your personality or appearance if you didnt have one.....that just explains you The dances were more of a updated version of the latest dances The Telescope comment wasnt called for amd and the noise you heard that was so loud was called Surround sound its located in practically all Movie theater Please Find Something positive out of it atleast I give the movie 10starts its a Must see film GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!! *********
0	(yawn) Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Not unlike watching the hundred hour previews before the Oscars or SuperBowl... lots of glitter, much pomp, much applause (especially for old favorites)and a couple of good bits. Best taken in small doses
1	His Short Brilliant Career This is the Hollywood biography of `Buddy Holly', Charles Hardin Holley of Lubbock Texas. The film opens on a roller skating rink in 1956. The band played "rockabilly" instead of the usual "country and western" music, reflecting the changing tastes. Then Buddy played "That'll Be the Day" (based on a character in the film "The Searchers"). Some complain. There is a funny scene where a minister denounces this music - in 1956. [Bill Haley and his Comets had a national hit in 1954, then came Elvis in 1955.] The radio station owner had to listen to his sponsors; certain sample records could not be played. A talent scout invited them to audition in Nashville. Buddy had arranged his music for a 3-man band, minimizing costs. But this seems novel, and his band did not meet the company's needs. New York is looking for "new sounds" that will attract customers. Buddy Holly's "Crickets" have that sound. A station in Buffalo NY played their record continuously. Teenagers bought his records for his new sound, a high-energy music that reflected 1950s America. Buddy Holly wanted to be the producer in charge, a change from the usual business practices. [There seems to be some kind of joke about the racial identity of this group, not true at the time.] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Fats Domino appealed to white audiences, a symbol of changing times. But legal actions put an end to some careers, and Elvis was drafted. But the toothpaste was out of the tube and nothing was the same afterwards. The film shows the overdubbing to create an echo effect, first pioneered by Les Paul for vocals [To recreate this for live audiences, another hidden singer was used.] Buddy said goodbye to Peggy Sue and hello to Maria Elena. It shows the Crickets at an Alan Freed "Rock and Roll" show in Brooklyn. Eddie Cochrane covered a song by Jerry Lee Lewis. [Eddie Cochrane died young in a 1959 car crash.] But Jesse and Ray Bob long to return to their home in Lubbock, even if they might miss the Ed Sullivan show. Buddy convinces them to stay and perform. After they leave, Buddy keeps his word and lets them keep the "Crickets" name. The manager explains the need to personally tour to sell records. A personal appearance sells more records, customers buy them like souvenirs. It would be a five week Winter Tour of the Mid-West. So the business needs win out. The ending has the show in Clear Lake Iowa. Disk jockey J.P. Richardson talks his famous "Chantilly Lace". Buddy sings to an adoring audience. His "True Love Ways" used violins and other instruments. Buddy's sudden death in February 1959 shocked teen-age America. Some admirers in England used an insect name for their group, but their talents were greater still. If Buddy had lived, he could be singing today in Branson or Las Vegas. Would he have moved on in the late 1960s, like the Beatles? Or died prematurely by misadventure like Elvis? "Of all the words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: it might have been."
1	Good Biopic Preety decent movie based on the life of Buddy Holly,don't know how much is true,there might be some exaggerations,but hey no biography is 100% fact.......what is fact is he put out a lot of catchy hits in the span of 2 years,before he got killed in a private plane crash at 22 years old that also claimed the lives of pop stars Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson in February 1959......good biopic,not sappy and stands the test of time
1	A Passover Sedar that's anything but ordinary You know it's going to be a bad day when you need two boxes of matzah on the night of the first seder. Sure enough, a family's biggest problems come to light during the Passover seder as they try to get through the "world's fastest Passover seder," which turns out anything but. Instead of rock 'n roll, prepare for sex, drugs and zany antics of the Jewish kind. Ira and Peggy Stuckman (Michael Lerner and Lesley Ann Warren) head the diverse blended family consisting of a son addicted to drugs and Dad thinks he cured him; a yuppie-turned-Hassidic son who won't work with Dad in his Christmas ornament business; a daughter who is a sex therapist and Dad knows it; a daughter who is a lesbian from Ira's first marriage; and an autistic son. Bring together a family like that, and you know it's not going to be an ordinary or speedy seder. Ira and his father Artur (Jack Klugman) lost most of their family during the Holocaust. Grandpa is still angry with Ira for not going into the family haberdasher business and makes him feel like the least favorite despite of being the only surviving child. Still, Ira urges his Hassidic son to go into the Christmas ornament business. Out of respect for her recently turned Hassidic son, Peggy hires Rafi, a tough-looking Israeli with an eye patch, to build the tent so the family can hold a seder like the old days complete with pillows and lamb roasting on a spit. Before the seder begins, the drug addict fetches antacid for Dad and adds Ecstasy to give him a different perspective. That's only the beginning of the family's journey as Dad starts seeing things including Moses and starts believing he, like Moses, must lead the family out of darkness into the promised land of acceptance and forgiveness. Though a spoof-style comedy, the story intertwines humanity and lessons without an overdose of sweetness. The family gathering can easily be seen as a Thanksgiving gathering, a Christmas dinner or any other family get-together where members clash over who they are and what they want others to be. When Do We Eat? rolls humor, quirkiness, Jewish traditions, inspiration, spirituality and a dysfunctional family into a 90-minute funfest. Don't expect it to be the funniest movie ever. If you're OK with Jewish and drug humor, prepare for a good time as the movie contains plenty of laugh-a-lot moments and plenty of witty and animated dialogue. Extras: not captioned or subtitled

0	I'm a Mamet fan, but this is probably his worst. I gave this movie every chance, but the story is slow, the acting is liveless (Ameche is the only one half-way decent), and the story turns out pointless. The ending doesn't really make any sense or have any impact, and the vagueness and indirection that is usually explained at some later point in Mamet's films is never clarified here. Only watch if you're a die-hard Mamet fan so you can say at a dinner party, "Yes, I saw that one, and I agree it was bad"
0	Insulting for people of faith, in my opinion First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake. Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm. That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?" This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism
1	Great Drama for Trekkies and non-believers alike Like the recent revival of the Ford Thunderbird, the Enterprise Season 3 DVD set is overpriced although the product within is beautiful. The video quality is fine, sound is rich, and the extras are good, but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series, like Freaks and Geeks, without the high price. (Through a series of fortunate events, I got my copy at a discount.) I don't consider myself a big Star Trek fan. Most of the shows set in the Trek universe work so hard to be "Star Trek" that much of the life is gone from them. My immediate attraction to Enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows-- for example, "comic relief" is blissfully absent here. The goofy humor of Star Trek: The Next Generation never appealed to me. Fox Mulder's dry wise cracking on The X Files? Funny stuff! Commander Data trying to be Sherlock Holmes? Not so much. Season 2 of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories. (Wow, there are aliens trying to destroy the Enterprise with a time bomb! Oh, it was only a dream.) Threatened with TV extinction, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman (who wrote many of season 2's episodes themselves) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging Trek formula. All kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored, characters gained dimension, and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in Enterprise's 22nd. In season 3 we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera (wowie zowie phasers, stunts, and great production design) and the ideas of real speculative fiction (cloning, dimensional shifts, and temporal manipulation). Ruminations on loneliness, loss, and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama. (Curiously, religion is absent.) At the same time, Archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of ER so compelling. Few big-budget action movies pack as much interest and emotion as "Star Trek: Enterprise-- the Complete Third Season.
0	"Best Show Ever"? ON WHAT PLANET? So now we have the female version of"OZ"..."OZ"of course was the american cable soap opera show about a bunch of notorious scum,which treated these losers in such a way as to make thier rotten lives,twisted morality and worthless goals palatable..Of course the"critics"loved this show,but then again the"critics"seem to love anything that is not decent,or made for the mainstream audience...This is why the"People's Choice"awards differ so greatly from the other "professionals-only"awards shows,like the oscars.."Bad girls"is merely an"OZ"retread,only this time around the losers are females...The plots are much the same..the same sort of bottom-feeder losers,only this time they have jiggle...The same sort of rotten lives,the same sort of twisted goals,the same worthlessness of charecter...Most of the charecters in both "OZ" and "Bad Girls"ought to be put to death rather than glorified on a teevee series.."Oz" and this garbage are poster examples of why there ought to be a death penalty that is universal and immediate upon conviction...One can only wonder what bottom of the barrel group our"entertainment"industry will glorify next?Maybe some enterprising,and perverted,mind out there is even now writing the pilot script for "A year with Adolf,Eva,Goebbels,Himmler,the concentration camps & you",in which the nazis are seen as just plain folks,misunderstood in thier race-baiting and thier mass exterminations...Why not?Every other bottom-feeder group seems to be getting a cable soap opera show that seeks to portray them in other than realistic terms,so why not the Nazis?And after the nazis,can the inquisition,or the Armenian genocide be far behind
1	What a movie!!! It is a long as same as excellent!!! If you like an action this one is for you!!!
1	Operation Thunderball After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be. The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target. What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. This film has always been a favourite with diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. I met a very young couple this summer at the beach club. I happened to mention James Bond. These two half my age immediately said, "Thunderball!" Do you like "Thunderball?" I replied, "Absolutely. And by the way I see you are drinking Red Stripe Beer. Did you know that when Bond tosses Quarrel into those corrugated cartons in DR. NO those are cases of Red Stripe Beer?" And so I met some new Bond fans. As for the DVD, I liked the fact that they re-mastered the film in stereo, but it somehow is too overbearing in spots. I also liked the end titles on the British version much better with the original music that Barry had scored for this sequence. All that being said, I still always liked this film.
0	Watch this if there's nothing good on tv I Love Trouble is a lightweight romantic comedy of helium-filled proportions. It is effectively a vehicle for everyone's favourite movie darling of the early 1990s, Julia Roberts, to have some fun and look lovely while getting one up on the dastardly male lead played by Nick Nolte. Nolte plays Peter Brackett, a veteran newspaper columnist for the respected Chicago Chronicle. Ever the ladies man, Brackett can do little wrong in the eyes of the bevy of woman he attracts, his loyal readers, and even his grumpy editor. He manages to fly by the seat of his pants with deadlines looming and get his stories filed on time, every time (even if it does mean plagiarising himself!). Having just released a novel, Brackett is about to hit the book tour circuit, and life is looking good for this charming, yet slightly sleazy bachelor. This is of course until journalistic competition, in the form of the lovely Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts), comes along with her quick wit, sharpened pencil, keen nose for a story, and obligatory short skirt. In the end, this film runs out of steam and the ludicrous and contrived ending is probably 30 minutes too late in arriving. The actual train crash plot becomes secondary to the romantic battle between the two leads, which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter and some clichéd one-liners. There are plenty of awfully large plot holes in the story, some wide enough to fit Julia Roberts' smile through sideways, and you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the contrived scenarios. If it was an effort to recapture some of the past glories from the screwball comedies of the late 1930s, it failed miserably.
0	A Misfire from the 60s Although bold for its time, this film is nothing more than a rather unimaginative 1964 politically charged western. Apart from the novel idea of using the generic gung-ho western style of the day to advance a civil rights theme, this film is simply plagued with an unimaginative screenplay, poor direction, a script full of cliches, and terrible acting. A small town of Yankees is angered by the return of former confederate Matt Weaver (George Segal) and decides to hire a gunman. Jules Gaspard d'Estaing (Brynner), a creole from Louisianna, is hired to do the job but he is soon found to be a man of conscience and principle. It so happens that the Yankees are the biggots and the southerner the victim with the colored man as the conscience of the film. A predictable love affair also springs up in a vain attempt to relieve the audience from its boredom. This is simply a terrible film with cliched dialogues and situations juxtaposed solely to make a blunt political statement as to diversity, equality, and justice. Yul Brynner is the only good actor in this film and even his performance suffers as a result of this simply atrocious production. This film hasn't aged well and its subtle attempts at addressing the prevalent social issues of its day are as novel and moving as a Sidney Poitier film. This film is just too antiquated and poorly conceived to be worth owning or even watching.

0	Watch your step! I too was misled by these reviews, and I too am puzzled by the apparently sincere expressions of enthusiasm for this movie. Maybe you have to be Italian or Lithuanian, but I watch a lot of real Italian movies (the ones with subtitles), and they are not like this. I think that Dreyfus's character was inconsistent. He acted like a sleaze, and then he acted like a great guy, totally sincere, etc. Then he acted like a sleaze, flattering people, snowing them with gifts, etc. I simply think the screenwriter was trying for something he couldn't bring off. Similarly with the movie as a whole. This is not simply a feel-good family, although obviously the screenwriter was trying to paint such a family. There needed to be more interaction than the stereotyped hugs and such. Something was missing. Also, the story went nowhere. There was no plot, and very little story, and it lasted a long, long time. And the movie had nothing else to offer a viewer. I would say, be very, very careful before buying this movie. I don't think it was overlooked. I think it was looked at and turned down.
0	Dreadful I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched. Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings. Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up. But it makes a nice coaster, though
0	Did It Backwards-Ordered Diva-Read Reviews-Canceled order Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon
1	Really grows on you I consider myself Goth, even though I generally have to keep it hidden. I only mention this because I expected to Really LOVE this immediately! I was disappointed when I didn't fall for it right off the bat, but I did myself a supreme favor by watching it again. This is a jewel and has a lot to offer, but the caveat is that it might not be instantly accessible. That's good, though, right?? Who wants the same rehashed stuff over and over? My initial disappointments were, first, that the music wasn't "belly dance traditional" and in some cases not even belly dance at all, but it was just an expectations problem. The music on this DVD ranges from modern Arabic percussion/synth/vocal and modern ethnic/ modern bellydance to modern urban/ modern urban bellydance and Techno. My second disappointment was that the dancers' movements were unexpectedly slow, so that after the first 2 or 3 pieces I was so bored that I started fast-forwarding and then gave up completely. It turned out I needed a bit of time to "recalibrate" myself! When I purchased this DVD, I had never seen Rachel Brice or Sharon Kihara perform yet, and did not know anything about the Tribal style or what to expect from Goth bellydancing. If you are looking for strictly bellydancing, you should know that I would label 10 of the 20 pieces such. I would label 6 as a blend of belly and modern, 3 as strictly modern, and 1 as a pretty worthless music video trashy piece. Some specifics: Ariellah is very engaging and talented, very enjoyable to watch, with excellent taste in costuming. Her pieces are my favorites. I also enjoyed Asharah's dances and costumes. She is talented and only slightly less engaging than Ariellah. Ayshe's work to me is heavy on atmospherics and drama, with more gymnastics, jazz, and ballet than bellydance. Blanca exudes confidence but her dancing ability was hard to gauge because most of what dancing there is reminds me of what would be done in a go-go cage. The piece, which cuts between 2 locations and outfits, is visually a pretty piece nonetheless. Jehan's piece is too overtly sexual and, frankly, silly to me. Her buttocks are barely hidden behind filmy fabric in some shots, and she writhes on the floor in others. More like a music video than anything else. Neon's piece "Deja Vu" at least has bellydancing in it, but is also very MTV. Her costume is very cool, as is her Nordic queen look and extensive tribal tattooing. There are 3 duets. One I have labeled "Goth Bellydance Meets Riverdance" with a touch of martial arts. It is very charmingly performed and entertaining, even funny at first, and the costumes are very pretty. This duet and one solo have knives in them, and one other duet begins as a mock execution with one of the women wielding a large sword. It took a couple views to begin warming up to that one. All this said, I strongly recommend this DVD. The women are mostly talented, many of the dances are creative and different, and the costuming is interesting and lovely in almost all cases. In addition, as someone herself learning bellydancing, I feel the camera work is very good. I was never annoyed by it, nor did I ever have trouble understanding what the dancers were doing. My only complaint is that I would wish to see the costumes in even greater detail because I am working on designing one or two for myself, but more light would, of course, have ruined the atmospherics. :) In summary, I'd venture that only the very jaded or very midwestern will be disappointed if you give this an honest chance. Blink your eyes. Rub them. Walk away. Come back another day and watch it again. This DVD seems glacially slow the first time you see it, compared to the usual, more frenetic belly dancing we've all seen. As inexpensive as it is, I strongly suggest taking a chance on it if you like Goth fashion/ colors/ atmospherics and various bellydance forms, such as the Tribal style and other modern styles. I'm very happy with it
1	One of her best works, it's almost as if she lives the part In my opinion, this is one of Elizabeth Taylors best works. The film starts out with her basicaly being held, without her will, in a mental hospital. She meets a doctor (montgomery clift) who comes to see if he can figure out what is wrong with her, if in fact anything is. After meeting her, he decides to take her to his fathers hospital and work on her there. He puts her in the nurses' courters, so as not to make her think that she is mentally challenged by putting her with the rest of the patients. To point out the major reason why she is in the hostpital, it is becase she is being held responsible for the death of a mothers son, but near the end of the movie you will find out that it truly wasn't her fault. Not only does she finally rid herself of the evil mother, but she falls in love with Monty and live happily ever after. The end
1	Cracker: Series 1 Love the series, very dramatic, acting awesome. Robbie Coltrane is fantastic as "Fitz". Amazon prices are great and delivery fast. Purchased all three seasons
1	Our favorite Barbie movie yet! This movie is great,both my daughter and I love it. We watch ALL the Barbie movies and this one is THE BEST!!!
1	A quirky classic of television comedy Wow, I'm a bit too young to remember the Addams Family in its original run on network television, but I love the Charles Addams cartoons, and have always liked John Astin, so I bought this dvd set. It is just wonderful. Nice clean prints of the episodes. Great writing, and a wonderful ensemble cast. And there really is a subtle message in these shows about being true to yourself and being kind. The more savage-appeal of the movies is absent here-these characters are quirky, but well-meaning, and I heartily recommend this set. The commentary with Steve Cox, Lisa Loring, Ken Weatherwax and Felix Silla is also terrific and fun and gives a bit of behind-the-scenes flavor that is very welcome
0	All censored I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version
1	So Funny!!! One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Loved it
1	Not too bad. While not the best care bears show it was funny. I also liked how they were trying hard to appeal to boys as well
0	How bad can things get ? I dont normally slate films but this one was asking for it so bad. OMG- It saddens me to think the director got paid for this. Please someone- write & direct a good film for Van Damme- he deserves better than this..
1	One of my all time favorites Can't believe it's been twenty years, but this movie is still just as funny today as when it came out. Great script-a perfect cast and more laugh out loud moments than should be allowed. How Steve Martin's character made it through this trip through hell (some times literally) without murdering his thrust upon companion is just beyond me. The whole "you're driving the wrong way" scene is truely a classic as well as the question: 'Where is your other hand?'. Absolutely a joy. Highly, highly recommended
0	Corny, clunky, a deserved turkey of the early 90s. The Rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-Deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around Los Angeles, particularly the Miracle Mile area. It's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that can't stand on its own two feet. The plotting of The Rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare. Unfortunately, the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious. Worse still is the execution of the material. Every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma. Bill Campbell -- ever hear of him anymore? He overacts every single scene. Timothy Dalton? Hammy. Jennifer Connelly is the only one to come out unscathed. The direction is beyond weak. When The Rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged, so cloyingly "goofy" that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening. Add to this foul mixture a horrendous James Horner score... you get the idea. Still, some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points.
0	HANGING UP DISCONNECTS While watching this film, I found myself irritated with the whining and bickering that goes on, and wondering how it could have been better. HANGING UP tells the tale of three sisters: Meg Ryan is Eve, the bulwark of the family, runs her own business; Diane Keaton as Georgia has her own self titled magazine; and Lisa Kudrow is Matty, the somewhat vapid soap opera actress. Their elderly father (Walter Matthau in his last movie role) is having memory problems, can't walk and is admitted to a hospital. He is going to die. Ryan is the daughter who is saddled with the responsibility of her father, while the other two are too self-centered to even care. All of this could have made for a compelling "dramedy" but director Keaton allows over emoting and all that conflict to override the gentler side of losing a parent. And Matthau is not all that likeable either. Cloris Leachman has a brief appearance as his ex-wife and Adam Arkin is Ryan's globetrotting husband. It's surprising that the most honest moment in the film comes in a brief sequence between Ryan and the mother of a doctor whose car she crashed into in the hospital parking garage. Ryan tries gamely to hold the movie together and although she is quite good, she can't really salvage the film. Keaton and Kudrow are both adequate, but no depth is observed. Matthau is more like Matthau than a true character and it's sad that his last role is so unlikeable. HANGING UP tries to tackle sensitive and real issues but it's so contrived it fails
1	hd dvd clerks 2 whats up with the first guy this is predictable come on any way for you hd dvd boys and girls its clear and clean nothing you would put in and go wow look at that donkey! and whats is that kid doning in hi def watching that donkey ? and the sound is not going to show off that 5.1 but if your a fan of hd and clerks then put it in your cart and enjoy animal erotica
1	Heartbreaking I love these types of movies, b/c all of the reviews on this page are very thoughtful and interesting. I agree with most everything, but the one thing that keeps popping up that I DO disagree with is the idea that the characters are totally unlikable. I personally find the characters EXTREMELY sympathetic. These people are ALL in incredible pain. They are miserable. Not one single character is happy. They are all trying to medicate their pain, oblivious to the fact that the love they are ALL seeking is within arms reach, yet they step on each other to "get theirs" to such an extent that by the end no one is happy. Yes, May is an incredibly bad mother, but she has been a shell of a person her entire life, with practically no joy whatsoever. Ditto for the others. How in the world are these NOT sympathetic characters? I have a lot of love in my life. Of course I sympathize with those who have none.
0	No English audio track Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me
1	Elvis Lives I'm a big Elvis fan and when I saw this on TV I thought it was great and had to have it. The way they produced this film was great. You felt like it was a live show with Elvis. The way they jelled the past with the present was fanstatic. A must have for any one who is a fan of Elvis, or someone just getting started.
0	Really bad, don't do this to yourself I bought this set because I was jonesing to watch some baseball history before the season started, and boy am I sorry I bought this. The narrator is bad, the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive, and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting. Even at six times the price I recommend buying Ken Burns' "Baseball" documentary, by far the best thing I've ever seen about baseball. But if an 18 hour documentary is too much for you to watch, then I would recommend the "When it was a Game" series. Anything but "Baseball's greatest Legends - Diamond Memories". This set is so bad that I was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and I haven't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it. Please, save yourselves the money and most importantly the time. Do not buy this
0	The "Plan 9 from Outer Space" of Art-House Films Unintentionally hilarious; so pretentious and poorly made that I was strangling with laughter several times. Jesus/God/Satan has sex with every member of a cartoonish bourgeois family and ruins their lives in various side-splitting ways. The maid becomes a saint who eats nettle soup, cures scarred children, and floats in the air. The wife bites the side of her finger, has sex with random strangers, and screams with all the authenticity of a teen in a slasher flick as Mozart's Requiem thunders in the background. The movie is technically inept and badly written. Any randomly chosen film of Bunuel or Almodovar will have more to say about sexual politics than this Pasolini fiasco. Recommended only for connoisseurs of the atrocious. Two stars for the "So bad it's good" factor.
0	overrated I didn't think Chicken Run was that great. Yes, I'm aware of the big numbers the movie drew on opening weekend at the movie theaters, and I'm aware of its overwhelming popularity, but the movie didn't do a whole lot for me. I think the main problem is that the chickens have an English accent, making it hard to understand them. The film was also very dark and hard to see what was happening (no, it wasn't my television). The claymation is nice, but that's the only thing the movie had going for it
0	Black Bike Week The DVD covers all of the bike week including cars, women, and bikes. You really dont hear the traffic sounds, or cars or people talking. The background sounds or people talking is over shadowed by continuous background tracks. When you do hear background sounds or people talking its hindered since the music audio is higher than the verbal or background tones. Watchable, but not worth a DVD collection
0	Halloween III This movie absolutely sucks, it has nothing to do with Halloween or Halloween II. They wasted their time on this one. What the hell are they thinking not involving Michael Meyers or at least his mask. Duh!
1	"That's what I'm talking about--surviving." I had heard phrases like "Stepford wife," "Stepford wife-ish," and so forth over the years. After seeing this movie, I can see what people were talking about. This 1975 chiller features Katherine Ross as Joanna Eberhart, a New York City wife, mother, and budding photographer who moves with her husband and kids to Stepford, a beautiful, seemingly perfect suburb. I say "seemingly perfect" because while Stepford IS beautiful, there's something peculiar going on, particularly with the women. They are beautiful, polite, soft-spoken, and seem to live only for being Betty Crockers. It doesn't take long for Joanna and her new friend, spirited, strong-minded Bobbi Markowe (Paula Prentiss), to notice that something is a little off about these women. As it turns out, something IS a little off--they're not human, they're robots. That is, robots who live only to cook, clean, and please their husbands 24/7. Were they always like this? No. Once upon a time, they were actually human beings, with minds, personalities, opinions, feelings, and talents all their own. So what happened? It seems they they've been turned into robots by husbands who decided that they needed quiet, smiling, and submissive wives who would do whatever--and I do mean WHATEVER, including have sex--they were told to do. Joanna and Bobby--and a third woman named Charmaine (Tina Louise)--are the only women who still have a sense of themselves. But not for long, for soon thereafter, Charmaine becomes one of them, and eventually, even Bobbi, and sadly, Joanna, become Stepford wives, too. Some of the reviewers have said that the ending--where the wives are seen strolling through supermarket aisles in their dresses and hats--was shocking. I didn't see it that way. To me, the ending was more sad than shocking--sad in that Joanna and the other wives were no longer themselves, no longer possessed the qualities that made them who they were. During the movie, Joanna talks to her husband about surviving--that is, surviving to stay true to herself even when the other women around her have literally become clones. When Joanna is turned into one of them, she has been killed--in more ways than one. That's what happened to the Stepford wives--in the end, none of them survived
1	the dialogue cracks me up Trekkies who are into the preservation of timeline and continuity probably had kittens when they watched this movie, but this movie worked because it highlighted the interplay of the cast - our favorite fictional characters. Any two bit sci-fi director can make a movie with spaceships and any bean counter can keep a timeline straight, but we don't watch Star Trek for these reasons, do we? We watch them because only Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly can play Kirk, Spock, and Bones. The scene where they're talking about Italian food in the pickup truck still makes me laugh today like the first time I saw it
0	Paxil or Percocet might have been better... This movie is not grand on a the memoirs scale of "Grande" to me...there are better. I can't really understand why these flicks of "female depression memoirs" are becoming so popular lately... I could pull my hair out watching the tension and angst of Anjolina Jolie and Brittany Murphy in "Girl Interrupted", but not in "Prozac Nation". For one, Christina Ricci does not do anything for me as an actress. Yes, she looks cool in that Moby video, but really...she is just a bug-eyed over-hyped former "goth actress" -she could star in "Memoirs of Winona from Beetlejuice". Anyway, that said, Ricci at least gets the roll right aesthetically-she has her pants tightly rolled at her ankles, dons the heavy black plastic bangles and rolls her eyes on cue. I can give her credit for these efforts. She brings out the worst of the 80's -enough shoulder padding to drive anyone to Prozac. What I really dislike is the idea that this book or movie captures a "new" idea. I think the DVD would be a better "after school special". It doesn't thrill me or make me feel moved to be a better person. I can't find anything in the script that says "I am different from most young women's lives at college". Plenty of talented, smart women make mistakes in college-many abuse drugs, sleep with all the wrong men, and hate their mothers-this one wrote a book and sold it to a publisher. Where is the taboo here? Where are the revelations so terrible I need to peek through my fingers just to absorb them slowly? Even "Prozac" isn't tied into the movie physically until the end. There really is nothing here-just a diary with so-so actors playing out the roles.
0	Kind of easy, pretty boring I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD. I like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser. I did it once, didn't sweat and was BORED! It has been gathering dust ever since.
0	Blu-ray screws us here! The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie
1	Classic Sci-Fi Movie - A Must See For True Sci-Fi Fans One of the most re-watchable Sci-Fi movies ever made. I can watch this move anytime, anyplace and get just as much enjoyment as the first time I saw it. Very cool and clever special effects that make the planet feel very "other-worldly." Awesomely done CGI creatures which we see more of little by little throughout the movie. Absolutely great scenes such as the creatures pulling Fry down the hole, Paris shooting fire with his liquor in the dark night and glimpsing the creatures hovering around him, what Riddick "sees" with his eyes, Riddick gutting one of the creatures after holding it's arms, Riddick staying in one of the creatures blind spots, and the overall cinematography and pace of the film and way the scenes cut from one to the next. The story is simple--survival--yet highly effective and entertaining with all the characters' pasts and secrets and the choices they have to make throughout the film mixed in with a unique environment and threat. If you like any type of Sci-Fi, you should enjoy this movie. Best Riddick Lines: "Did not know who he was *&#$ing with." "I absolutely believe in God. And I hate the #$%^er.
1	My Son LOVES this He loves his Eric Carle books, so when Is aw this DVD I had to buy it, and it is a success! My son (2 1/2) wants to watch it every night. We watch it together before bedtime. He loves it!!
1	Maurice Chevalier remembers it well Paris in the 1950's ... and one of the last great musical films from a golden era. You will remember this film well. The teenage Leslie Caron is stunning
1	Unexpected barbs of humor; great score; worth it I expected a hystrionic-filled movie, and was pleasantly surprised by wisecracker Oscar Levant. He makes the film. Of course, whenever you buy one of these Joan Crawford works, you're going to get her flashing, emotive persona, but the stiletto-sharp writing and the beautiful score keep you from cringing. It's a treat to be front row at one of the several Oscar Levant / James Garfield (really Isaac Stern) piano/violin duets. This film is worth the investment. You will want to revisit the musical performances.
1	"He took the bait." Gynecologist, Catherine (Fanny Ardant) discovers hard evidence that her husband, Bernard (Gerard Depardieu) is having an adulterous affair. She confronts him, and he reluctantly admits that he's "occasionally" unfaithful. The details he gives Catherine are vague and sketchy, and the lack of intimacy in their relationship increases with Bernard's admission. Instead of demanding details of the affairs, Catherine nurses the shock. In the aftermath of Catherine's new knowledge, she quietly reevaluates her marriage and Bernard. One evening, Catherine enters a bar. The bar is full of girls who host clients of both sexes in the rooms upstairs. One of the girls, Marlene (Emmanuelle Beart) approaches Catherine, and they strike up a conversation. Catherine employs Marlene to approach and seduce Bernard. Marlene posing as "Nathalie" is then to return to Catherine and give her the details. "Nathalie" is an interesting twist on the old adultery story. Catherine, the wronged wife, nurses her anguish, and then converts it into something peculiar. She selects a woman she finds extremely attractive, and then gives this woman the task of seducing Bernard. Is she motivated to get the details she just imagines? Is employing Nathalie an attempt to control her husband's sexuality? Is a warped revenge at the heart of Catherine's conduct or is Nathalie a surrogate? While the film is not for the easily offended, it's more an intellectual exercise in human sexuality--there are a couple of sex scenes, but sex is talked about more than actually committed. While the very best French films don't provide a definitive answer, Nathalie has a vagueness that leaves a certain lingering dissatisfaction. In spite of the fact that Emmanuelle Beart in lingerie is pivotal to the film's promotion, this is Fanny Ardant's film. "Nathalie" is ultimately a woman's film with adultery presented from the female viewpoint--make no mistake about that. If you enjoy this film, I'd also recommend another film from director Anne Fontaine, "Dry Cleaning". "Nathalie" is in French with English subtitles--displacedhuma
0	Discovery Institute Imitation This is the Discovery Institute's imitation of Emes "Powers of Ten" and "Cosmic Voyage," in another attempt to establish Intelligent Design as science. The Discovery Institute's key witnesses lied in the recent Kitzmiller case and even went so far as to include astrology as "science." The Discovery Institute has been thoroughly discredited and its products should be avoided. Get the genuine DVDs, avoid this DVD
0	Women in Prison sleaze Italian style This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura Gemser will find this one a total bore
1	Comments from a Ballet Student I think this DVD is GREAT! There are many ballet dictionaries available but to SEE how the steps are done is more useful and clear than mere words could describe. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the DVD quality to be fine. This DVD is an invaluable reference for any ballet student. Although I have been learning ballet for only 2 1/2 years as an ADULT ballet student with no ballet background at all, I now take 8-14 classes a week (with teenage students!) and have managed to reach Level 5 and even do Pointe work so I can say with the conviction of a serious ballet student that - This DVD is an EXCELLENT reference for anyone interested in learning ballet. I would recommend the DVD version instead of the VHS because it makes for easier and quicker selection of topics (imagine having to rewind and forward on VHS!). If you're thinking of getting this DVD, go for it
1	Larry does it again!!!!! As you already no larry the cable guys is an awesome comedian. So putting him in a movie s a brilliant idea! this movie is so funny!!! one of the best comedies ive ever see
0	Dear Walt Disney! Do you think we're fools??? First of all: I LOVE this movie!!! I give it five stars and more! But what is your problem with selling a perfect DVD to make your buyers happy? I saw the movie years ago in Germany in the original format and language. The beautiful Song: "When love is gone" was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in Widescreen format! So... what is your problem to release the DVD with these features. Do you want to make even more money, by saying in a couple of years: "Sorry, we made a mistake. But here's a new DVD with all of the features for ONLY xx.xx$? I'd recommend to all of the fans: "DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!" Don't play into the hands of these big corporations!!
1	My First Exposure To Tolkein: Enjoyable But Not Addictive Yet I for some reason was resistant to reading "The Hobbit" when a teen-ager. I was not resistant to seeing these movies; I just didn't take the time. To be honest, I found it hard to get into the movie. An hour into it, I could have given up on it. After seeing the first movie (I was a little disappointed to feel like I only saw an incomplete story), I am interested in seeing the sequel, but not so interested that I'm rushing to get it or where I'll feel I missed out if I never find out how the story ends (which I'm sure will be good being victorious over evil). I've just explained why I only gave this movie four stars. Now, let me tell you why it earned that many (in case you couldn't tell from the other 3000+ reviews). The special effects were great. But so was the acting. Very effective was Ian Holm, Ian McKellan, John Rhys-Davies (remember him from Raiders of the Lost Ark?), Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortenson, and Christopher Lee. Another thing I enjoyed about it is some philosophical insights, introduced by Gandalf the Grey, especially the advice he gave to Froddo on his decision to move forward
0	Poor Jayne, What A Waste! The Las Vegas Hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Buren and Ferlin Huskey. It appears to be a low budget film due to the photography, acting and settings. If you are a Jayne or Mamie fan, you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only. One highlight of the film is Ferlin Husky's dream sequence of Jayne singing "That Makes It." Air time of Jayne is very small. Trivia: the Siamese cat in the film, which Jayne is holding, belonged to Jayne's friend May Mann.
1	Kimi is the best!!! I love little baby Kimi!! I was so glad when she became one of the Rugrats at the end. She is so cute and so sweet, it would impossible not to like her. She looked really, really cute at the end in that weird robe, yeah
1	Teachers can use this Realize that no one said this is "real". It's a movie about the FUTURE people. That being said, I teach high school biology and environmental science and I find this to be an excellent and entertaining DVD series. I use it to reinforce principles like: Plate tectonics, Climate patterns, Adaptation, Desert formation, Biomes, Eusocial insect societies, and especially, Evolution. I could go on and on with the concepts that are applicable to this series. I have been using this series for 3 years now and I have yet to have a student complain about the series being boring or too "fake". I have had MANY students ask if this is real, to which I have to remind students that it is set in the future and therefore the animals can't be real but the concepts are real. Why is this applicable to teachers? The DVDs introduce fictional creaures, many of which are absolutely fantastic, and then procede to explain how the amazing things they have come up with are already around on Earth right now, just in different forms. So the series really is about present animals as much as future animals. I use it in high school, but it is just as useful for middle school. Please, if you are a science teacher, you owe it to yourself to see these DVDs. When you see how good a teaching tool they can be, you'll want to purchase these (or get your school media center to purchase them!).
1	Well produced, fun experience As with all the other HD IMAX titles, "Speed" is a fun ride. The WMV High Definition quality is excellent, the story is engaging, and the production quality is top notch
0	only a slight improvement above Kickboxer 4 Kickboxer and/or Mark Dacascos fans may want to look elsewhere. While Kickboxer 5 is a bit better than the fourth, that's about it. There are a few good fight scenes halfway through the movie but then it goes downhill from there. Kickboxer 5 starts off with David Sloan getting murdered by some crimeboss in South Africa. Mark's character declares vengence (what a surprise!) and he goes off to find the crimeboss responsible for David's death with the help of an escaped convict. The final fight scene with Mark Dacascos and the crimeboss is just as ridiculous as the final fight scene in Kickboxer 4. As most direct to video films go, this one doesn't deliver overall so if you are one who wants to see the Kickboxer series than just stick with the first three movies. Trust me on this one
0	An opportunity wasted... I saw the Amityville remake last night. I absolutely loved the original even if it didn't age well over time. I think what made the original so good was that the characters who played the leads really looked frightened e.g. James Brolin ,Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger really conveyed fear in their eyes. The newer version stars Ryan Reynolds, who is more renowned for comedy and Melissa George, an Australian actress who started her career in daytime soaps. Philip Baker Hall plays the priest Fr Callaway. It would be unfair to describe the acting as incompetent, it isn't. My main problem is with the plot and the way the film unravels. The opening sequence shows the massacre of the DeFoe family by Ronnie the son who goes mad. This is quite a creepy sequence and uses similar imagery to the film Se7en. It sets the scene nicely. Then we cut forward to the Lutz family who snap up the property and are told of the house's history. After initial reluctance, they decide to move in and give it a go. Then the weird things start to happen like the apparition to the Lutz daughter of Jody Defoe, the girl who was murdered by her brother a year before. There are one or two jump out of the seat moments after this but I consider the film to be a wasted opportunity overall The film turns into a budget version of The Shining , concentrating on the declining sanity of George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds. This insanity builds up until the end of the film where he comes to his senses and the family escape the house. In the original, the insanity of the Lutz father is only one of several episodes to befall the family in the house. Gone is the appearance of the demon pig, the secret room behind the fireplace painted in blood and other such episodes. Most disappointing was the brief appearance of Philip Baker Hall, an actor who is normally excellent at conveying distress (remember him as the dying quiz show host in Magnolia ?).I expected lots more from his appearance in the house than the swarm of flies attacking his face ? I suppose one of the main problem with the film is it's brevity. It clocks in at under 90 minutes in runtime. What starts out as a very eerie film ends up another shlock horror zombie film. It could have been so much better really.
0	Cardinal sin... Yah just don't go messing with a series' soundtrack. Especially on the original Japanese track! :
0	They Were Onto Something... This is definitely one of the strangest superhero movies I've ever seen. Daryl (Damon Wayans) and Kevin (David Alan Grier) are two brothers who grew up on watching "Batman"...and nothing else is explored with that opening scene. Kevin has grown up to be an writer for one crazed editor. Daryl, on the other hand, is an inventor who, of course, has dozens of ridiculous gadgets that will somehow pay off...or will they? Yes, his tools are creative, but they serve no purpose other than comic relief, which I didn't find funny except for Daryl's embarassment. Sadly, the two brothers' grandmother is killed because she works for a City Mayor nominee who ticked off a cliched mobster (Jon Polito). Daryl swears revenge by dressing up in a ridiculous costume and using those odd gadgets to fight crime and build a secret hideout (which I'm surprised nobody finds since it's at the end of a train track). Let me make this clear - there are some hysterical moments in this movie. The bickering between straight-laced Kevin and wannabe idealist Daryl is side-splitting. In fact, just about every scene with these two is very funny. The problem with this movie is that it has such a dark, dramatic tone in some scenes that just doesn't fit. For example, Blankman takes a reporter (Robin Givens, who's basically a black version of Lois Lane - that's not a racial slur) to this hideout, but there is some music that reminds me of a despressed version of Danny Elfman's score of "Edward Scissorhands," and some comedic actors trying to be serious about the world and love. That scene is absolutely disastrous. There's another scene when the Mayor is going to publicly open a bank and asks Blankman to be present for the dedication. But then Polito's mobster and several thugs chain him up and set off a time-bomb that kills the Mayor, and possibly other people. THIS IS NOT FUNNY! The movie is not trying to have a dark sense of humor at all, but instead goes for laughs that seem like they belong in "Don't Be A Menace In South Central..." The contrast of tones and themes don't work. Another case in point, Blankman fights crime on his first night out and confronts a pimp slapping a woman around, but then Blankman's genius idea is "Slap me around and call me Susan!" The scene is funny, if improbable...but seeing a woman slapped around and turned into comedic violence feels wrong to me. Maybe I'm taking this movie too seriously, but when I see some jabs at classic superheroism that make me laugh uncontrollably (Daryl's inability to face life seriously instead of as a TV show is priceless), and then see some drama that is not only misplaced, but also horribly filmed and acted, then the potential hides itself underneath a movie that's trying to be a superhero comedy "PLUS" an urban drama "PLUS" a hip-hop flick. This movie has a serious case of split-personality with no hope of control. I really want to like this movie, but it strikes so many wrong notes that I can't quite recommend it
1	Mel Gibson's lost kick-butt movie found The best action movie I've seen this year isn't in theaters. You may think you've seen it, but probably haven't. "Payback" is back, this time the way the director envisioned the film, not the suits. "You don't make pictures for the elite," producer/star Mel Gibson says today, explaining why Paramount and Warner Bros. took the noirish gangland movie away from freshman director Brian Helgeland. After 10 days of reshoots, a new final (third) act was tacked on, voiceover was added a la "Blade Runner" and Kris Kristofferson walked on as a new major character. Audiences still were amazed how brutal the Gibson character was when they had to "Get ready to root for the bad guy," as the marketing had it. Same old story about artists and Hollywood, but this time came a happier ending. In 2005, Paramount and Gibson gave Helgeland another shot at the film, eight years after its release. The tapes turned up missing, so Helgeland and his editor recut the film using film. And so we have "Payback: Straight Up -- the Director's Cut." Now, this is one hard-boiled movie. Gibson plays a criminal who comes back to town looking for the partner who stole half his loot, and his wife, following a heist. Along the way he single-handedly takes on both the syndicate and Asian drug dealers, slugs a woman (a scene the studios cut), and stirs up a John Woo-like shootout as the bloody finale. Supporting actors Lucy Liu, Gregg Henry and Maria Bello all do fine work. There are multiple DVD extras, including a director's commentary, but the one to catch is the half-hour "Same Story -- Different Movie," all about the film's resurrection. Audio and video are sharp on the DVD -- and better on high definition discs, although in places the colors seem a bit too jacked up for a gritty, bleach-bypass film. "Payback" comes from the same book as "Point Blank" with Lee Marvin, an even better film from 1969
0	the worst Bond film EVER! After reading the reviews on here i went and rented this movie license to kill with high hopes and expectations. Needless to say that i was let down. This Bond movie is about one of James Bonds best friends get put in the hospital while his wife is killed. So James goes on a revenge rampage defying M and MI-6 to do so. I thought that it sounded cool but it was a drag. It started out GREAT with a lot of action and a solid plot. But as the movie progressed it got REALLY slow. And the end is so fake and hookey that it comes off as comical. This is the worst Bond film of all time! It isnt worth even your time. Now dont get me wrong i LOVE the James Bond series. And no-one can even come close to remotly compare with Shawn Conry! He is the only TRUE Bond! But the other Bond movies are all good. In fact this is the only Bond movie that ive seen that i didnt like. Just dont even bother wasting your time
0	kind of aimless I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort.
1	Just like old times! When I found out these shows were on DVD I had to have them. My husband and I used to watch the series and enjoyed it very much. Now we are enjoying it all over again. I will be ordering the remaining series. I currently have 1-3
0	Heavily edited broadcast tv version The 1983 thatrical release tells the true but much abridged story of Billy Mills, the Oglala Sioux who came from obscurity to win the 10,000 meter race in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The core of the movie focuses on Mills's stint as a student and runner at the University of Kansas,facing the overt racism of his teammates and the white community, and his personal conflict with his coach, played by Pat Hingle, over Mills's racing style. The racing scenes are some of the best on film (if you overlook the out of place football field at the Olympics), and "Running Brave" rises above the level of the other sports hero genre and other racing films. I have given this DVD a 1-star rating because it is NOT the theatrical release, but the version that was re-edited for broadcast TV. (The movie was released as PG. This version, as noted on the DVD box, is rated G.) Several key scenes have been deleted, watering-down or eliminating much of the conflict. This DVD uses a 4:3 (TV) aspect ration, not the theatrical widescreen presentation. Quality of the video transfer is very poor.
0	Vile I have to tap into my memory banks to recall a more repulsive film. I came up with "I Spit On Your Grave". Director-star Melvin Van Peebles has the audacity to pawn off his nihilistic fantasies as wish fullfilment for the black population as a whole. There were a lot of artistic triumphs to emerge from so-called "black expoitation" genre and this is not one of them. This collage of violently misogynistic images can be attributed to the auteur himself. The film starts with Van Peebles exploiting his son Mario by showing the adolescent servicing a prostitute. The film goes downward from there. Van Peebles directorial style is hackneyed and the acting is amateur hour. Don't be fooled into thinking this is some sort of landmark film. It's unadulterated [...
0	You Had To Be There Made for a pittance, initially released in just two theaters, ultimately grossing over ten million dollars, "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song" became the progenitor of the "Blaxploitation" film craze of the seventies. Considered a seminal film in African-American cinema, Director Van Peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole. Its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how African-American audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt. The plot is simple. Sweetback (Van Peebles himself) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions. One night, he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning. A murder case lacks suspects, and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force's lenience toward the establishment. En route to the interrogation, however, the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him. Using his handcuffs, Sweetback kills both officers. The rest is a protracted chase, with Sweetback using his fists (among other body parts) to make his way to the border. The police question his companions, hot on his trail with guns, bloodhounds and (at one point) a helicopter. Van Peebles has an eye for a striking shot, and there's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing Sweetback's friend Beetle that get their point across. While its historic contribution is clear, "Sweetback" has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value. Van Peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero, but there's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor. There's plenty of sex and violence to be had (the 'X' rating is fully earned), but it's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips, and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome. Thirty years after its explosive release, "Sweetback" will remain compelling for film historians and students. Its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers, but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well. PS - The DVD release has an interview with the director. Initially, it shares some formal similarities with the feature, but later it settles into some interesting (and amusing) anecdotes. PPS - I just saw "Badasssss!" (Mario Van Peebles' docudrama on how "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song" was made) last night (10/25). It makes for a great double feature, as it really helps you to understand how difficult that production was
0	Very Disappointed!!!!! Although the description says "animated", don't believe it!!! The only animation for the George clip is someone moving pictures of the character around!!! My granddaughter (4), kept asking when they were going to do something! The other parts--yes curious george has only one episode even though the title says other wise--were very disturbing to my granddaughter. All in all, money I shouldn't have spent!!! sandy ;^
0	Good Band - Horrible Audio Quality I love the band but the audio quality was miserable. It sounded like it was recorded from the back of the hall with a hand held low-end camcorder. Maybe I got a defective copy?
1	home alone I first saw this movie on a flight to dallas airport. the entire plane was laughing so hard the Flight attendants had to stop serving.
0	WORTHLESS WASTE OF FILM AND MATERIAL! Why won't this crap stop? I keep telling you that there is no need for a sequel to the original Children Of The Corn. CRAPY GARBAGE
1	charlotte betty davis is the greatest in this movie, and i recomend it to anyone who is a fan of her's. c.schuber
0	This is not Teen Titans This show joins the long list of comic cartoon abominations. And it's done in anime. Maybe someday they'll do a Teen Titans: The Animated Series.
1	This is a must see! My husband made me watch this and at first I was not interested but then after a few minutes I was hooked. This is a must see. You get a good insight of just what things were like in the 30's and how the children of American Indians were treated. Don't pass this one up
1	Tommy, a forgotten classic Tommy was the epitome of the 1970's. This movie included Elton John and Tina Turner in their youth, not to mention all the member of The Who. Worth the price just to watch Ann Margaret swimming in a living room flooded with baked beans! That deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pinball
0	Don't waste your money! Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD. It's a travesty of the DVD medium. Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously: they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy. Don't waste your money on it
1	awsome!!! it's a great family show. Its heartwarming and funny. Watch it from the begining, it will bring you laughs and tears. Its all together great
1	A great movie for Halloween. If you're looking for a true scare, then look no further than this movie. I like movies that give nightmares, and this one is no acception. Vincent Price is a legend and this movie proves it. This movie has everything, from screams, to all sorts of scares. Highly recommended
0	Dull, Baby... Dull! As a gothic-horror-lover i bought this according to the high-praising reviews, acclaiming it as "atmospheric", "moody", "stylish", "gothic horror gem"... WELL... If you ever saw Terence Fisher's 'Horror of Dracula' from 1958 (in fact 10 years before this film!) you know where the benchmark for classic gothic horror lies. This Hammer Horror movie masterpiece delivers not only the visual beauty of gothic atmosphere and technicolor delights, but also magnificent performances and dynamic suspense. Kill, Baby... Kill! whereas is really a lame and tedious experience in this genre. Despite of its overly moody gothic sets, the suspensful musical score and the lush settings and colors, there is really not enough atmosphere or suspense that may grip you and get you into the story. The plot is very weak and holds no real surprises. Overall it looks rather cheap and lacks of good performances or dialogues (whereof there are few). The repetitive all too long "creepy shots" can get really annoying even if the director tries really hard to make suspensful Hitchcock-style camera work. Sorry, but that's not enough. This is neither a real Gothic Horror (cause it's too cheap) nor a Giallo (cause there's no gore). If you think that gothic atmosphere sets, "endless spiral staircase shots" and a more or less creepy child staring into the camera are enough to make a good horror movie, then this one's for you. To everyone else i recommend any Cushing/Lee Hammer movie or V.Price Poe movie for real atmospheric classic gothic horror!
1	Semi-Good. Semi-Tough is one of the few football movies I never got around to seeing until the other day and I am sorry I waited. It is a humorous, energetic send-up of football, celebrities, and post-sixties New Age mumbo-jumbo. As for what another reviewer said about Jill Clayburgh, I have to agree, she's completely miscast here, but that's my only acting criticism. I think Reynolds is outstanding in this role and really stands out. He is compelling and believable as Billy Clyde Puckett and his presence basically carries the film. What I found most unique and valuable here, however, was the satire involving Friedrich Bismark and BEAT--which was a paper-thin roast of Werner Erhard and EST. It is rather courageous that this movie decided to tangle with those parasites in the way they did, but it remains a rare example of Hollywood using its special position in society to advance the public good. There are other inventive parodies here as well such as the owner's devotion to "moveogenics," and Reynolds having to get "pelted" by a quack doctor. On the whole, Semi-Tough is a good bit of fun and also has something to say to its audience.
1	For Love is as strong as Death A young couple, very much in love, stop off at a tavern in a small 19th century German village. A gaunt, grim faced stranger joins them. Just recently the stranger had purchased a 99-year lease on a tract of land adjoining the village's cemetery. The stranger had built an impregnable, `without door or gate', wall about the estate. The stranger, of course, is Death, and within the walls of his `garden' reside the souls of the newly dead and the innumerable candles whose flames melt the tallow of all human life. Death attends the young man he is about to claim. The woman leaves the room for a moment, and when she returns the stranger and her beloved are gone. The woman gives chases, sees the shade of her beloved pass through the impassable wall to Death's garden. An old apothecary finds the distraught woman and shelters her in his pharmacy. The woman drinks a potion from an ancient bottle and is again in front of the walled garden - although now there is a door opening to a steep staircase. The woman enters and meets Death of the staircases. I want to go where my beloved is, the woman tells him. Death strikes a bargain - if the woman can save the life of just one of three whose candle has grown short, he will return her fiancé to her. I liked Fritz Lang's DESTINY (Der Müde Tod) a lot. Death's bargain plunges the movie into three episodes, as the actors playing the loving couple and Death reenact endangered love stories in Arab, Italian and Chinese settings. Lang employs primitive, and effective, tricks - camera angles, double exposures, etc. - to show the dead filing past the living, to make carpets fly and to transform pagoda into elephants. Underpinning it all is the fascinating struggle between Death and Love. It's Lang's meditation on this struggle that I enjoyed the most. After that poignant scene on the staircase I was hooked on the woman's quest for reunion. The musical underscore is appropriate, tasteful and unobtrusive. The print is in good condition, watchable with flares and scratches. Although this disk is a little pricey, it contains no extras of any kind.
1	The Critics Didn't Get It. So Who Listens to Critics? The Frisco Kid, directed by Robert Aldrich, is the quirky inventive saga of a young Polish rabbi who is sent to America in 1850 to take over a congregation in San Francisco. Getting there proves to be quite a test of his stamina, his adaptability, and his religious faith. Gene Wilder's performance as Avram is a jaunty, sweet, and convincing triumph of comic bravado. After docking in Philadelphia, the rabbi plays Good Samaritan to three nare-do-wells who later rob him and strand him in a strange land. Fortunately he comes upon some Amish farmers who give him shelter and money to resume his trek. After a brief stint working on the railroad, Avram meets Tommy Lillard (Harrison Ford), a bank robber with a heart of gold and a quick temper. The two team up and go ricocheting from one adventure to another -- an escape from a posse, a trial by fire at the hands of some Native American Indians, a visit to the brotherhood of silent monks, and two violent encounters with the bad boys who robbed Avram in Philadelphia. Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford are one feisty team as rabbi and rescuer in this rough-'n'-ready romp that rivals Wilder's earlier Blazing Saddles in Wild West hilarity. Director Robert Aldrich is a seasoned hand at blending roughhouse and laughter, as fans of his earlier The Dirty Dozen and The Longest Yard will attest. With a full posse of screen talents, The Frisco Kid rides tall in the comedy saddle. Movie critics of the era panned the movie saying: "The pairing of Gene Wilder and a young Harrison Ford may sound intriguing, but this film is not. It's a startlingly unfunny comedy in which most of the jokes misfire and the evolution of the characters is forced and unbelievable. Wilder is a great comedic talent, but salvaging this material is beyond him." Evidently they weren't looking for a good time. Talk of plot character 'evolution' should be worried about in film making classrooms. I think they should have actaully sat back and just enjoyed the romp. The Frisco Kid is an offbeat comedy that manages to convey the sturdy faith of a believer. Avram will not travel on the Sabbath for any reason; he returns his share of the money from Lillard's bank robbery; he transmits the joy of Judaism to the Indians; and he agonizes over murdering a man in self-defense. Whereas this movie will probably not become a smash with the public, it is highly regarded for the religiously sensitive.
1	The Blue Man My daugther loves this movie and watches it over and over again. Very good clean humor
0	Don't buy this version Buy one of the other versions with special features. This is the older, first-generation DVD with NO features. Nothing. Plus, this is a flipper disc! A great movie worth owning.. just not this edition
0	Overt Child Exploitation That Never Redeems Itself Satisfyingly A well-acted, well-portrayed, sickening, overt example of an adult whose sole desire for a child is based on getting that child to meet his own selfish needs. He has little or no love for the child based on who the child is in her core, and sends her the basic message that she does not count as a human being aside from being an object to gratify him. If the child does not mold to his expectations and desires she gets rejected, and this is the horrible tension of the movie. Although the movie has some twists and turns that shake things up, the man's character never develops much in a satisfying way, and nor do the basic themes of adult selfishness and cultural repression. As such the movie is essentially non-redemptive, and portrays a sad and tragic side of humanity. Although this movie is set in an outer province on China in the 1930s, it's actually a good metaphor for Western culture, much as Western cultural norms do not allow parents to exploit their children so overtly..
0	Deficient Erotic Thriller Sequel without Connection to Predecessor... The original film 8 MM deals with the theme of why people commit horrendous acts of violence, as it deals with an 8MM film that contains a real murder. These films have been dubbed snuff films. Director Alejandro Amenábar even makes a better story of his terrific thriller called Thesis (1996) that portrays a female college student studying violence in media who also comes across a snuff film. Thus, when a title comes out with the name 8MM 2, the audience will make the logical deduction that it will also deal with a theme of why people commit vile murderous acts on film. In addition, to set the film in east Europe enhances this notion of brutal violence, as many films and news updates contain dreadful crimes in Eastern Europe that have links with organized crime. Thus, the implications of another tense and suspenseful cinematic event is set to bring viewers down the horror lane. However, it would be complete miscalculation by the audience to make the inference that the sequel would follow the same theme. Here in 8MM 2, which does not even have any of the same actors, director, or theme, merely applies the title of a successful film in order to attract viewers. The film tries to evoke a similar atmosphere of depravity and immorality among the upper class, as Joel Schumacher's 8MM. It succeeds to some extent, but does not have the same grim and dark touch. 8MM 2 opens with a shot of a courtroom where a number of people are talking while the sound of a passionately active couple sexually pleasure one another. Here the story advertises the film's path, as David (Johnathon Schaech) tells his fiancé, Tish (Lori Heuring), about a sexual fantasy of his. They are on their way to a weekend vacation at a luxurious hotel where they intend to bathe each other in sinful lust, which enhances when Tish invites a woman to join them after a nightclub visit. Together they end up in a ménage à trios that they never are going to forget. After the return from their wicked vacation, there are obviously some tense emotions underneath the surface. It bears the same sentiments that Threesome (1994) portrayed through three sexually experimenting college students. However, the emotional turmoil quickly evaporates when David receives an envelop with pictures of Tish, David, and the girl that they met in the club. Due to Tish's father's political position as an ambassador in Hungary and a potential candidate for the Supreme Court nominee and David's future in politics they cannot approach law enforcement. It leaves them dealing with the criminals themselves, which brings them on a journey into the Budapest red light district and the world of pornography. The film provides a futile attempt to make it a political thriller, but this too fails. Instead, it provides an erotic thriller with non-existent suspense, but much erotica. In some aspects, the film will remind the audience about Wild Things (1998), but there is far more sexuality present in 8MM 2. The film tries to hide a poor story underneath the world of sex while dealing with a rather amusingly silly extortion affair. In addition, Tish and David also seem completely oblivious in regards to the threats that the underworld could pose on them if the criminal elements so desired. The many awkward moments within the film outweigh everything else, and leave the viewers with a hollow and empty cinematic experience. 8MM 2 was a rather disappointing film, as it had nothing to do with the original film with Nicolas Cage, and the story was a clichéd combination between Wild Things and an adult film. The question is whether the audience is better of with the latter, as the story does not capture the audience's attention in regards to suspense, or drama
1	Why not let the general public see this......because of drug use? I have been wanting to see this movie for years. I finally found a copy[...], of all places. Why doesnt any walk-in rental store rent this out? They rent out Cheech & Chong movies, but not this? Gimme a break, Hollywood & Blockbuster!! This movie isnt even glorifying drug use, like Cheech & Chong. Instead it is about finding yourself! The performences by Luke Wilson, Brittney Murphy, Jack Black, Andy Dick, and Jeremy Sisto are oscar worthy. Not to mention Alisia Witt.......HOT!! Highly Recommended!! And, you dont even have to be buzzed to watch this. Its that good!
1	Shanghai in the 1930s: Love, and Fate Collide This film is deeply intense. There is often silence that is thick with meaning. The camera often tells much of the story, honing in on the actors and actresses faces ... the spartan rooms ... the city scapes/ scenes ... the commotion of workers going to and from work ... the riots, protests and rebellions ... the crowds of people at the railroad station in Shanghai. The film begins in Shanghi in 1928 where Cynthia (Zhang Ziyi) a Chinese young lady has a love affair with Itami (Toru Nakamura) a Japanese young man whose father is part of a Japanese delegation who lived in Shanghai, seeking political opportunity to destabilize the region. Times are tense, the atmosphere is ripe for political change and explosive events ...Itami is called back to Japan to serve in the military and their brief but very passionate love affair is cut short. The film is impressionistic and surreal in how it portrays events and relationships. There are clandestine organizations at work, and it is not often clear who is involved in what until some complicated twist and turn in the plot occurs to reveal the truth. Early in the film, Cynthia's brother is ambushed by a Japanese underground group. He is murdered before her eyes. This causes her to join the "Deep Purple" a clandestine Chinese revolutionary group who try to bring about justice for China and eliminate the Japanese threat. Zhang Ziyi does an outstanding performance in this serious role. After witnessing her brother's murder, she takes on a false identity, Hui Deng, a nurse who works at Marion Hospital. Hers is a stellar performance along with Itami played by Toru Nakamura. Hui Deng participates in an assassination at the railroad station where Szeto, a Chinese agent of Deep Purple, loses his lady love, accidentally killed in the crossfire. He is also given a briefcase by mistake which puts him in the middle of some very serious problems. Szeto becomes heavily embroiled in the activities of Deep Purple against the Japanese but he falls into a trap which puts his life at risk. He is in a very precarious position. He makes a deal, it saves his life but ulitimately because of the direction he went ... he ends up losing it. Itami returns to Shanghai to take over as the leader of the Japanese movement. He is replacing Mr. Yoshikawa who is being recalled to Japan. Itami is managing the upheaval and creating more dissension and rioting, through his spy network and underground operations. The Japanese want to control Shanghai. Cynthia again enters Itami's life and becomes personally involved renewing their love affair but with ulterior motives. However, Itami is not who he used to be and neither is Cynthia the same person she was. Unknown to Itami, she is now an assassin and revolutionary. Itami asks Cynthia to return to Tokyo with him, he even arranges for legal authorization with his boss. Itami and Cynthia attend a party at the Japanese Club, where they dance to a very haunting and beautiful Chinese tune, called " A Garden Bridge". The events which transpire at the party are jaw-dropping. The twists and turns of the plot are unpredictable and very satisfying. The ending will astonish the viewer ... At the very end of the film, there is actual black and white film footage of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai around 1932 which brings *full* closure on the film. This is a most astonishing complex story with exceptionally artistic cinematography and great acting. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]
0	hitchcock breaks his own rule and sinks this turkey hitchcock said in interviews that the most important thing in a movie was if you do a flashback,the flashback must not lie to the people watching. if it does it distroys the trust we have placed with the film maker and hurts the feel of the movie. this first rule of his was thrown out the window with this below average hitchcock thriller. never before or after did hitchcock do this lie in the flashback thing. the acting is also well below what he was used to having in his movies. a rare misfire from hitch
0	One lead too many makes for a dull movie. I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception. It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong. These two actors were great as a team. Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot. When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring. Why was he even cast in this film? This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again
0	Disappointing This is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons. First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events. I understand if you can't cover everyone, of course you can't, but they left out more than they included. Really disappointing...I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again
1	excellent package I really enjoy my dvd, their was no marks or lines on the dvd which was excellent.Picture was clear and prefect from the cover to the actual dvd.
1	Like an Old Friend That I Haven't Seen in a While I have Seasons 1 & 2, & couldn't wait for the next installment. This was my favorite show when I was a kid. It feels like I grew up with these girls & Mrs. Garrett was the wise grandma I never had. Alot of the episodes now play like those old After-School Specials, but I just can't resist going back to a more innocent, light-hearted time. It definitely gets nostalgia points & will make you smile
0	Waste of Time There is no acting in this film. All it is is 80 minutes of conversation between three people which sometimes becomes so unbearable , that i wonder why I just didnt switch the movie off!
0	Two Girls, A Guy and a complete waste of time Love Heather Graham and that is why I bought this movie. The "explicit sex scene" is not explicit and in fact, is not much of a sex scene. Great idea and could have been a great movie. Talent was there, opportuinity was there, but all wasted. Totally out of reality as to how this would have gone down as well. It would be every guy's fanatasy if the two beautiful women he was "doing" found out he was canoodling each of them and when they find out all they do is chew him out for not being honest about it then say, "I know, why don't we all three date. We can be a triple rather than a couple." Yeah, that happened with all the women I ever dated
1	Interesting Batch Of Curios. I must admit that I was reluctant to buy this set thinking "Oh no, not another batch of slapstick comedies" but being the silent film completist that I am I purchased it. Although I'm glad I did, this set is primarily for hardcore silent film afficionados like myself. While there are a couple of offerings from Chaplin and Lloyd and single comedies from Charley Chase and Stan Laurel, the bulk of this 3 DVD set is devoted to lesser known comedians and in a couple of instances truly obscure ones. This would probably make AMERICAN SLAPSTICK of little interest to the public at large. All of the films included here are taken from 16mm source materials and while many of the prints are in very good condition, they are not up to the standards set by earlier collections from Kino and Image Entertainment although this title is being distributed by Image. For the serious collector that is more than offset by the raritiy of some of the comedies in this collection. Do the names Eddie Boland, Perry Murdock or Frances Lee ring a bell? There are also complete versions of frequently excerpted shorts such as Larry Semon's GOLF (1922) and the Ton Of Fun's HEAVY LOVE (1926). The Snub Pollard starring vehicle SOLD AT AUCTION (1923) is one of the more amazing silent offerings I've ever seen complete with an astonishing array of imaginative camera tricks. The set is worth it for this comedy alone although Billy Bevan's LIZZIES OF THE FIELD (great title!) from 1924 is not far behind. Final assessment: AMERICAN SLAPSTICK features an interesting batch of curios from long forgotten or up and coming comedians in mostly good condition with suitable musical accompaniment provided by three different performers. A must for diehard fans of silent comedy but not the ideal set to start off with
0	Weak Winslow Remake I must admit I am more than shocked to read some of these reviews. All those that haven't seen the original starring Robert Donat et al simply haven't lived. Some scenes have been completely desecrated. The Donat "liar and a thief" questioning scene of the young Winslow, is one of the best in movie making history. The equivalent in this remake is so weak that even 'Sir Roberts' attending solicitor also lends a hand in the questioning ! However it may have been David Mamets intention not to even to attempt to try and emulate. Likewise 'Sir Roberts' courtroom speech was completely missed. Beg, steel or borrow the origianl VHS copy, and if need be go out and buy a VCR just to watch and enjoy this gem. If there is a movie studio lobby somewhere to get 'essentials' like this released on DVD I'll join it ! ! ! !
1	An old classic This movie is an old classic. I used to love this movie when I was a child, so I bought it and my friends and I were laughing at Sho'Nuff with his big ugly self. And now my children like it as well. Yep, this one's a keeper
0	OMG. So bad. So very, very bad. Painful. No, seriously... this is bad on a rare scale. Forgive me, but after watching this festering pustule of a movie I've simply got to rant a bit. I normally don't trash films, but this one deserves it SO badly... I'm sorry. This is a movie that's about as interesting as watching grass grow. A chimp with a camcorder would shoot something more interesting. I wish I could give it a negative rating but the pop-up menu only allows a "1 star" as the lowest. I can't remember a movie where the audience's time is wasted any more completely than with this crapathon. You know when you go to someone's house and they show you home movies of their trip to the beach? And you have to sit through two hours of not much going on while their kids play in the sand... and you keep looking at your watch wondering when it will ever end? Well, that's "Raiders of the Lost Ark" compared to "Open Water 2". The Three Stooges are brain surgeons compared to the characters in this movie, the writing and story are laughably bad and the director makes Ed Wood look like Martin Scorcese. Maybe they ran out of money before being able to complete the movie they originally intended to make... because if not, those who made this pitiful excuse for entertainment should be thrown off a boat somewhere as payback for the time they caused everyone who watched this stinking dung heap to waste. Pretentious, annoying, stupid on a monumental level. This movie makes Catwoman, Basic Instinct 2, Jaws 4, etc. all look like Citizen Kane.
0	So Boring, So Dumb What was the point of this film? There is no lesson learned, no story to tell, no entertainment factor even associated with it. I guess it was an excuse for Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming to try to prove that they have no imagination and get their Hollywood buddies together for 2 hours of nonsense.
0	CRAPPY REMAKE! The Shining remake was Casablanca compared to this drivel crap. Do not watch this movie. If you are a hardcore fan of the original Salem's Lot, you will suffer. This film is as bad as the unecessary sequel Return to Salem's Lot. Ther shoud be a zero star option for this film
0	NOT what I expected. Don't waste your $$ I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns
0	The Stepford Wives Lay an Egg A few days ago I was delighted to learn The Stepford Wives would be shown on cable TV, but I soon realized I was watching a turkey. The opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the Jerry Springer show, and from that point it's downhill all the way. The plot is weak, the characters inconsistent, and the story incoherent. The production values of casting, costuming and set design are certainly high. But that just makes this movie a pointless, glossy mess
1	Warning: This performance is addictive! I've been a big fan of Jean Luc Ponty and Stanley Clarke for years. I've owned the "Rite of Strings" CD for a couple of years and find it quite unique and enjoyable. The music is very complex both in composition and execution. That is, you wonder how 3 guys can produce all this complex sound. I recently purchased this DVD and have watched it with great delight several times. Seeing the music performed is quite illuminating. I have a new, great appreaciation for Al DiMeola! For all you guitarists, this is a must-see performance! His Ovation guitar has the most beautiful, clear, bright sound and his playing is unbelievable. The sound quality of the DVD is fantastic and the camera work contributes significantly. In fact, I would rate the camera work on this DVD at the top of my list. You are treated to up close fingerwork as well as shots showing the interplay between the performers. This performance DVD will blow you away
1	A bit light but nonetheless good historical wrap- up I think it's hard to listen to EVERYONE talk about what Punk rock was - to sort of link MC5 to the Clash from west coast to east coast - the reality is - like any art movement it meant different things to different people. And while one dyed in the wool punk might say Robert Fripp's guitar solos were punk, another will tell you that guitar solos are self-serving, bloated, and not at all about punk. I've always felt that musicianship, of one form or another, has always been necessary, the reality is good punk rockers learned their craft well, and quickly - good punk rock, for me and mine - was never about flouting lack of skill (and it wasn't honestly lacking from the great ones!). It was also NEVER about punk fashion for my friends and I, and mostly for the original punk bands it wasn't much about the "punk" fashion either. This set of disks documents largely what we all already knew - that there's really no such thing as a distinct Punk rock movement - and that the garage bands of the sixties, and the ROCK and roll created in Sun Studios in the 50s was all incendiary and necessary to something young people needed to do in the mid to late seventies. The NY movement vs. the English movement is well documented if a little disjointed here. I never had much use for the romantic lyrical style of the New York scene and while Patti Smith is a genious - she was never a punk to my ears. Punk needed not just attitude, fashion, or stylistic differences - it also needed something to rail against. and no one did that better than the Pistols and the Clash - or more specifically Lydon and Strummer. Both individuals specifically missing for different reasons from this documentary. Instead we are treated to Henry Rollin's rolling eyes - just fine, a chubby James Chance, pretty good, and even a slightly softened siouxie - as they all coast into middle age. MUCH of the 80s scene is excused from this movie - Husker du, the Minutemen, the Fall, Manchester in general (besides some quick footage of the buzzcocks and a second with pete shelley (a bit more of Devoto)) and scads more - for a treatement of Nirvana. Time to stretch and Yawn if you're me. I liked Nirvana, I think Cobain was brilliant - however, it's not punk - and if Green day or Rancid get face time - it's only because the audience was long built and harnessed into place by those what came before. As they say. It was fun to see Rollins dish a bit out to the likes of Limp Bizkit and there's some choice extras on the 2 dvd set. And it's always interesting to hear Biafra talk (I like him, you may not). All in all a good purchase for those of you who never saw footage of MC5, or some of the other seminal acts of the early to mid seventies (Who cares about the New York Dolls???). However, it is a bit SHORT...about 90 minutes. Rock music of any genre to really be complete needs to spend more time with the performances and less time with the interviews/reviews. Having the Ramones bash out Loudmouth is either going to grab you or not. Sonic Youth is a performance band, they are far better in person than ANY recording they've done. Having any sniffin' glue or punk paper (and god I miss those old tiny print mimeographed fanzines - there was something so intimate and delicious about them) tell us it was a seminal moment is unnecessary. If you step in a ring and get trounced by a great boxer, you don't need some sideline personality tell you you got your ass whipped. OK :) have fun
1	Great if you're just starting I'm just starting out. I have tried to get into other video workouts and I just can't. I screw up every dance maneuver or "walking" based move they throw at me. Debbie does the workout so that I (as a complete clutz and I HATE exercise because I feel stupid that I'm not coordinated)feel like I can do it again. I like her telling me about coaching because I need it. If you need encouragement for getting started this is a great place to start. There is also a 50 min. CD you can use for outdoors. I don't need cute or chatty or some aerobic glam girl. This is a great place to start. I can't see myself doing only this video, but give it a go. It's definately motivated me for 5 days solid.
1	Doris' Expressions are Priceless Season Two starts off with a bang as Doris gets a job in San Francisco. The farm is still present though with Grandpa and the boys. Doris is a fantastic comedienne. Her expressions are absolutely priceless....the way she rolls her eyes in exasperation is a classic "Day" trademark. The way she incorporates the "ums" in her speech is natural without being phonetically annoying....another "Day" trademark. She is a joy to behold and McClean Stevenson and Rose Marie are on hand as great second bananas!! This collection has some truly hilarious episodes!! I laughed my head off in most of them!! A timeless series for the whole family to enjoy!! No sex, no violence, no innuendos....just good "wholesome" fun!
1	Walk on Water The article was well packed and arrived quickly. I like the service that is behind the ordering and shipping. It's clearly service I shall use again
1	Interesting Twist to the Stockholm Syndrome This film is about finding a Nazi approximately 50 years after World War II in order to assassinate him. The Mossad agent, Eyal, just returned from Turkey and killed a terrorist there. His new assignment is to be a tour guide to a young German named Alex Himmelman, whose grandfather was the Nazi killer. The plan is to get friendly with this tourist and learn whether or not his grandfather is still alive, then "to do God's work before God is ready to take him" according to the Director of Mossad. The elder Himmellman is believed to be alive in Argentina where he escaped after the war. Unfortunately, when Eyal arrives home after the Turkish assignment, he finds his wife dead on their bed. She had committed suicide ... This life-altering event may affect his judgement and skills according to his superior. He is offered counseling but declines. His shooting abilities are tested on a target range from time to time, to ensure he is able to complete this important mission. The film is fascinating on many levels. It delves into a deeply serious subject and questions the ethics of doing this type of work in a most creative and artistic manner. As Eyal becomes more friendly with Alex and his sister Pia who lives on a kibbutz, he begins to like them. Eyal places a bug in Pia's apartment to catch any conversation they may have about their grandfather's past. The conversations are all innocent until one night, when Alex tries to pursuade Pia to return to Berlin to visit her parents, to attend her father's birthday party. It turns out, Pia had a huge fight with her dad about the cover-up of what her grandfather had done during the war. One does wonder, why does the granddaughter of a Nazi end up working in a kibbutz in Israel? The film builds suspense and mystery based on this very question. The complex nature of the film makes it a superior viewing experience. The subject of the film is dealt with in a senstive manner and is balanced with humor. Eyal is played by a very handsome Israeli actor who befriends Alex and then learns by chance that Alex is gay. This subject is presented in a natural flow within the story line of the film ... The metaphor of "walking on water" as Jesus did on the Sea of Galilee is used with great affect and meaning. The viewer will be thrilled and entertained as intensity builds and the mysteries become more complex before they are resolved. There is a huge unexpected climax before the surprise ending brings about a 360 degree resolution to the conflicts. This is a most highly recommended viewing experience. Erika Borsos (pepper flower
1	Great Horror flicks The 1st one is Excellent, The Second one is BLAHHHH but funny and fun to watch, the third one is better then the second one but not better then the first one lo
1	My 3 year old loves this video!! He asks to watch this several times a day and even when we're not home, he asks to see it when we get home!! It keeps his attention the entire time it's on. Highly recommend this entire series of videos!! We have them all!
1	Bubble Boy This movie is hilarious! Jake Gyllenhaal plays, Jimmy, a young man who has lived in a bubble all of his life because he has no immunities. When Jimmy's love interest decides to marry someone else, Jimmy must cross the country to get to Niagra Falls to stop the wedding. Of course, he meets many new faces and adventures along the way. This movie makes me laugh no matter how crappy the day is so if you are interested in slap stick comedy, buy it and watch it with your friends. Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as usual. This actor's range is impressive..how'd Donnie Darko go from living in a bubble to being a gay cowboy? It is just neat.
1	santa's here stay far away from the sequel, but watch this one. It was definitely worth the money spent on this. People offended by this movie had no lives or no other current events to spew hateful remarks at. why, or who, would NOT want to see Santa kill off people? this is a society who watches leprachauns, snow men, scarecrows and god knows what else kill people for entertainment. but this movie puts all the others to shame and stands out to me as a truly unique and enjoyable experience.
0	A little bit of crab!!! The movie Silent Night Deadly Night was not a suprise as i thought it would be... The Silent Night part 2 was a crab! While i was wathing it i thought i was watching part 1 again. The first fifty minutes of the movie was a revision of part 1. Dont bother to buy it..At least not the part 2!!!!!!!!
1	Great historical fiction! I daresay that Mann's adaptation of the film is better than Cooper's book. Expanded scenes are slight, but fun additions to the a fantastic film
0	Defective DVD? I'm a fairly dedicated Blur fan, so it seemed that I'd enjoy this DVD. The only problem was the sound...which was mostly distorted and sounded like it was "static-y", for lack of a better term. After watching it a few times, I went to the fan site www.blur.co.uk and in the forums found that many others had experienced the same problem. Apparently "Starshaped" was originally realeased on VHS when this footage was first captured in the early 90's and the VHS version has much better sound, confirming that the sound isn't just "raw", as it is live concert footage. One theory is that the sound was not correctly "mastered" when this DVD was produced, hence it is likely a problem on all copies of this DVD. I do have to say that the US version of the video for "There's No Other Way" was good (it's a hidden easter egg - click on the star in the top level menu). But I couldn't justify spending $13-14 for just one music video. I have returned the DVD for a refund
0	Good, but overrated. There are better Cary Grant movies out there to watch. This one is just about ok. The movie DVD is released by various companies. I had the BFC edition, and was not very thrilled by the print
1	In the beginning... Holy cow, these 10-minute animated shorts are awesome! The funnest part in watching them is to see Superman, Clark Kent, Lois Lane and the whole gang in their originality. The stories are basic but smart, quick-paced, exciting, and heroic. Yeah, the soundtracks are a bit over-the top at times, but that was the music style of adventure movies in the 1940s. I love the spirited characterizations and some of the stories like with the volcano, the runaway train robbery, etc. I also noticed how the recent Donner and Singer films have borrowed from these. Especially in "Superman Returns", his flying style of dropping out of the sky feet-first was originally done in these animations -- COOL! A must for Superman fans.
1	Cheeseburgers not out of reach for action 'legend' Whoa. Seagal has just gone off in the last few years. After getting back to theaters with Exit Wounds in 2001, he made the appalling Half Past Dead, and has now settled into his straight-to-DVD throne. The guy must be making some serious change from these movies. He's banged out around three flicks a year since 2003, all so dedicated to the new formula that I can only applaud him. Seriously. He just plays Seagal, and he's always an ex-secret agent, or something or other, he has the long coat to hide his wide-load body, and he whispers his words, getting dubbed in the process sometimes(!), and tries to underscore his films with a positive message about the environment, or life, or wisdom. I mean, the man was proclaimed as the reincarnation of a Buddhist Lama not long ago, which apparently does not conflict with his doing one cheap action flick after another for a few million. Oh, and he has a band and plays blues and tours and appears in guitar magazines. What a renaissance man. I don't remember the plot or story to this one, I only saw the last 15 minutes. Suffice to say there are more exotic locales, another Asian director, excessive use of Seagal's army of stuntmen, more shameless Seagal mythology, more fat Seagal in long leather coats. And yet, he is probably making more money than ever by now. After that Mountain Dew commercial, because we all know Mountain Dew is the preferred elixir of Lamas everywhere, he is raking it in with these little gems. They either have a) an Asian director, b) a rapper turned actor (DMX, Ja Rule, Treach, etc), or c) both. The hairline retreating from his ever-expanding face, the acting still, er, bad, the action still incoherent due to editing that masks the fact that Seagal can't do any stunts (except for the one where he finishes off an IHOP Grand Slam breakfast in seconds), you know what you're going to get. Idiotic 'entertainment' and a damn good laugh, even a cry for how far the large man has fallen. No doubt this and two or three other flicks will be packaged together as a morbid DVD special
0	Blood Sport Rules!!!!! Let's face it, TBS won't even show this. We've all seen Blood Sport 30 times on TBS, and it's good. Now, I've never seen this movie, but looking at the cover, it sucks. There's no action on the cover. Van Damme made one good movie, and blood sport was it. Now Daniel Bernhardt tries to jump on and ruins everything. It's like watching The Karate Kid III, after Ralphie grew up. Don't read the reviews for this. Look at the cover and hit yourself. Continue hitting yourself until you realize you were about to make a horrible mistake. You'd be better spending your money on Howard the Duck
0	Warning - This is not the Baywatch we remember I've purchased seasons one and two thus far. If this third set is as poorly done as the first two, stear clear. If you remember the old LPs that stated "all songs performed by original artists" meant that the songs were rerecorded. The first 2 sets were poorly done. Season One, from NBC has been named "bonus" selections. this is clearly a ploy to force a collector to purchase all seasons just to aquire the true first season. The music on the series is nothing short of annnoying. It simply is poor and detracts from our collective memory. the picture quality is poor and looks extremely worn and dated. I can't get over the music. It is really that bad. Bad enough that this set should be rejected by consumers. One can't help but feel cheated when the waited for DVD set lacks the original audio (replaced by truly awful songs), and the picture quality so poor
1	A delight I highly enjoyed this movie. All the way through I was entertained by the story and involved in the lives of the characters. Unless there were some swear words I missed I have no idea why it got an R rating. There were a few sex scenes none of which showed much skin. I would cry 'double-standard,' but what's the use? Anyway, this movie is definitely worth your time.
0	Former cinematic genius goes soft. Back in the 90's Shinya Tsukamoto burst onto the scene with the explosive Tetsuo the Iron Man and the riveting study of ultraviolence Tokyo Fist.Over the years his films have become more coherant but also less interesting.Vital retains a little of his visual energy though unfortunately the story about a man with amnesia who discovers he's dissecting his lost love at a college isn't very compelling.There are some nice dream sequences but the film lacks the energy and sheer creative force of Tsukamoto's earlier films
1	Definitely worth buying I use this video as an adjunct to taking classes in both tribal and cabaret styles. The warm-up is thorough and the explanations throughout the DVD are helpful. The break-up of the choreography allows you to personalize your session goals. I have been studying bellydance for a little over a year and this DVD helps solidify the foundations and also provides enough of a challenge to keep me coming back
0	Yawn! Has nobody seen through Scorseses weak plots yet? He makes one exellent gangster film (Goodfellas which after all was based on a book) then repeats the same formula for almost every other film. So we have the Italian mafia in Goodfellas, the Jewish mafia in Once upon a time, back to the Italians but change location for Casino and now we have the Irish and 'native' mafia. So what next for Scorsese when he runs out of ethnic groups for his mafia films? This film lacks everything. Loosely based on historical facts its slow, dull and only made vaguely interesting by the odd input of horrific violence (just as all of his gangster films are, the start of Goodfellas, the baseball bat scene in Casino etc) Sorry but this film lacks everything.
1	For Every Nerd With Dreams of Grandeur I found this series especially delightful because Robson Green's character lives within the confines of his own mind. Though he shows remarkable insight into the actions of the violent and deranged, he also displays that phenomenal lack of social consciousness that is particular to geniuses and artists (as in &quot;Yes, I just invented nuclear fission, but no, I didn't know I was supposed to wear socks and shoes to this award ceremony.&quot;). This makes for some truly unusual and amusing situations, that help bring levity to the gruesome crimes he investigates. If you like Touching Evil or Monk, this series may be for you.
1	Machine Head great comeback No words can express my great appreciation with the band...starting from Imperium until thier rendition of Davidian and Block , wow....this is a true definition of Headbang. Since I bought thier first album Burn my Eyes and The More Things Change...I already know that this band is a straight up Heavy Metaller's....Anyway, just watch thier interviews and find out how hard it is to be in a heavy metal band. It is much better if they released it in DTS format, but anyway..Ten Ton Hammer and The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears is present in their setlist...so what more can you ask for.... Order it here in Amazon....NO
1	It's not "just" giant robot anime (part two)... Here's the deal if you have not seen the series don't watch this movie. It would take far to many words to explain the series it is something that has to be watched to get. My only notes are that it's not that hard to follow as long as you are good at paying attention to details (and of course you have seen the series and did honestly pay attention to it). Other reviewers I'm sure have summed up what it's about. The movie is basically the action packed, mine-trip, fight scene, blood-n-gore of the end that many said was lacking in the last twp episodes of the series (I.E. what`s happening "out side" of the characters minds in reality). This movie is just as deep and sometimes down right confusing as the series, and that`s why I like it. For me mixing parts of this movie with the series episodes 25 and 26 was vary satisfying. Many say watching the movie between episodes 24 and 25 seems right. But really it would take a huge edit job to get it right. All the parts are there you just need to rearrange them the to make them right in my opinion
1	a good workout I feel this is a pretty good workout. the cardio is good, but not too much. She doesn't mention much about the fact that we're pregnant, but I feel it's a safe workout and a good one. I'd recommend it to anyone that exercises on a fairly regular basis.
0	BAD, BAD, BAD I never, and I repeat: NEVER walk out on a movie, but when this garbage came out in the theater I was out the door in 30 minutes or less, I was glad my tickets were for free. However, MY TIME WAS NOT. It was so stupid and totally off-balance that I have made it personal mission to validate how bad this movie is.If gangster movies is your thing please watch "The Untouchables" or something equally cool. Still have it on my list as the top 5 "so bad that it is bad" movies of all time. Some movies get the coveted "So bad that is good" title...this is not one of them. Garbage.
1	This Movie Is A Romantic Comedy Gem! And Ms. Lopez Is One Classy Lady!!! This is a very enjoyable and lighthearted look at Love through the eyes of two people who fall in love but try to deny their feelings for each other. Ms. Lopez plays a Wedding Planner who falls in love with the fiance of one of her clients. The scene where she has a little too much to drink is sweet , charming, funny and at the same time touching which is quite an accomplishment for any actress. Ms. Lopez is a lady of many talents. She can sing, dance and act and sometimes do all three at the same time! She also proves she is much beter at this Genre of film than the tiresome Sandra Bullock and Meg Ryan. Encore Ms. Lopez!!
1	Beauty is skin deep If only we can all see the inner beauty in people, we will all live in a better place ! This is a cute comedy romantic movie that shows the viewer how shallow we are when it comes to physical beauty, aren't we all guilty of it. If only we can see folks for what they really are. I avoided this film for years, because of Jack Black, but I did catch it on TV and enjoyed the plot of the movie and eventually liked the way Jack Black did the role of Hal. Interesting POV's and lots of funny moments in this film. 4 stars for Jack Blacks performance
1	Great workout for busy people! This workout is formidable for those who don't have a lot of time to work out. It targets all major muscle groups, arms, buns, thighs, abs and it includes a stretching section. Several exercises are performed to target each muscle group, so the workout is never boring. Moreover, the exercises are very simple to follow..One can definitely feel the burn, a sign that the exercises are working.
1	Romero, please forgive me!!! As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, "Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives." Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks "punch." But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add "soul" to this film about the "souless" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the "Apocalypse," he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great "fifth-act conversion"!! What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!! The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the "real" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this "problem" with Boyle's 28 Days Later . . . in America we received the "happy" ending and weeks later, the "unhappy" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!) Hey, even if you don't dig close-examination of film (not everyone does!!) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it!! It will not disappoint!!! And prepare for Synder's new film: 300!! It looks dazzling!
0	fatal beauty I love this movie. I had it on video but wanted to up grade it to DVD
1	Classic Creature Movies II Well the "flicks" were definitely not award worthy but,they bring a nostalgia when seen.
1	beautiful piece of artwork It's an excellent piece of artwork with the right quantity of additional material in a beautiful metal cast case that's looks like the gas can of madman Mr. Blonde
1	Munich Zauberflote stands test of time While many traditional productions of opera these days look sleepy, either on a stage loaded with so much trappings and clutter, and/or looking as though a group of singers got dropped onto stage and left to their own devices, this is truly a most traditional production, in both all its consummate detail and inspired individual touches. A certain degree of realism and social commentary inform the August Everding production here. Sarastro's temple is set in solemnly austere design of dark brick and wood, which opens out into a silhouetted relief of what could pass for a Greek temple and also imaginatively to a decrepit looking courtyard, where Tamino faces his trial of silence, which gives us a hint that Sarastro's temple may have seen better days. A certain rigid manner about two of Sarastro's priests also tell us as much (and who are denied their brief Act Two duet). For the incidents of extra magic that occurs in this production, and that Mozart would have been happy with, in contradicting the cold reason of the Enlightenment, the scenes that take place with the courtyard set just mentioned practically dare you to blink, not to miss anything. I do not want to give away any secrets here, except that Wolfgang Brendel, as Papageno, in some of the action here, and everywhere, makes up for a few dry spots vocally, by perfectly natural acting of his part. Costumed as a simple warning man or peasant, he works very well, in interaction with everyone else, in capturing the full humor of his part. Brighter evocations of nature make up very pleasant backdrop for a couple of scenes during the finale to Act Two, for Pamina and the 3 Boys and for Papageno alone, right before meeting up with Papagena in front of a curtain backdrop of a giant oak. The temple, silhouetted before, opens out, suffused with cool light, as Kurt Moll as Sarastro blesses his two new initiates, Pamina and Tamino. Lucia Popp, as Pamina, is practically enough reason for giving this Zauberflote the highest possible acclaim and for why this belongs in every serious opera dvd collection. Take for instance her opening of "Ach ich fuhls" in Act Two, which immediately touches the chord or setting for what the entire rest of the aria will be like, which she continues to sing most expressively. Her scene, with the three boys is at least equally sublime in making her way from total despondency, despair to joyful anticipation of meeting Tamino again, consummated by her utterly exquisite "Tamino mein", upon finally greeting him, and radiant demeanor in helping the Tamino of Francisco Ariaza bring the trials of fire and water and their vocal parts to a close. Her acting matches that of Wolfgang Brendel in their Act One scenes together, in complete believability. Lucia Popp, as many fans already know, was some sixteen years before, a Queen of the Night of classic status on the Otto Klemperer Zauberflote (with all spoken dialogue taken out) for EMI. Eschewing the least bit of any exaggeration or hindrance to full expressivity of her lines, Edita Gruberova ideally, coolly yet imperiously picks up the mantle Popp had held for the part of the Queen of the Night before, in her musical and dramatic authority in it. Her sidekick trio of three ladies (Pamela Coburn, Cornelia Wulkopf, Daphne Evangelatos) are as fine vocally and musically, among video choices, as you will find. While perfectly seductive enough and costumed to be very attractive to the eye, this trio is perhaps a little less menacing than one other out there. Francisco Araiza, hardly more than a dutiful presence on stage dramatically, and with slight tendency to pout a few more dramatic lines in his part, warmly and elegantly spins out so many lyric lines here, with so much more colorful command of nuance here than found with Peter Schreier on Sawallisch's cd set or his own much drier, less interesting contribution for James Levine on the Met dvd. Kurt Moll is the warm voiced Sarastro, his voice rolling effortlessly through "In diesen heil'gen Hallen" and with expressive point both here and the other passages for him. A certain fire about his look or gaze informs even those moments of warmth to convey to Pamina his genuine forbearance in looking out after her. He reappears in the Met Zauberflote dvd eight or nine years later, with undiminished feeling of authority in the part, except for some obvious graying of his vocal prowess and a certain detached manner about him, that had me thinking that all this business with initiates and trials must be incredibly passe or perhaps long by now routinely and terribly de riguer for Sarastro. Jan-Hendrik Rootering is the ample voiced and authorative Speaker of the Temple, Norbert Orth the entirely black faced and mostly sweet voiced Monostatos, if a little less menacing than one or two others on video by now. Choral forces, including for a properly majestic rendition of and processional up high and stage rear for "O Isis und Osiris", and supporting cast are all in top form. I am not quite entirely sure, even after reading the annotation in the well informative liner notes (in nice booklet form) of the changing places between Sarastro's aria "O Isis und Osiris" and the brief trio with Pamina, and Tamino joining him,that doing this is right, but at least it is well accounted for in the liner notes and may persuade some viewers. Wolfgang Sawallisch leads a pleasing middle-of-the-road interpreation of this score, levelheaded in almost all choices of tempo and modern, yet supple enough in its simple pacing of so much, yet plush in orchestral sonorities, even with incidences of doubtful intonation from woodwinds. He is always very supportive of his singers, if not the last word in being imaginative with so much that this score has to offer. He improves on his earlier analogue set (that has been reissued on cd) in having a more varied cast here, in terms of vocal color, without losing out on issues of diction and meaningful interaction between cast members. An overriding blandness, sterility both scenically and musically to the Levine/Met Zauberflote on dvd, also on DGG, helps to make the Sawallisch here a clearly preferable choice. Ultimately, as well supported by Sawallisch, the expert staging here, and the contributions of just about every cast member, humanity emerges as the highest and most prevailing order in society, in place of a clerical, monastic, or even a Masonic one. The complexity of Mozart's vision is as well encapsulated here as may also be the case in one or two auteur productions of this great work. Here the charm of Mozart's inspiration endures from start - traffic signals both to left and right from a moon-silhouetted Queen of the Night in alt - to finish
0	Masters of Boredom This show was supposed to be about letting horror directors compete with each other to see who can come up with the scariest little horror show of the season. It has devolved into a bunch of has-beens using their ready-made audience to condescendingly lecture us with their dime-story philosophy and politics. Joe Dante's Homecoming, Argento's Pelts, and now this.
1	This dude is crazy! This is one of the 2 funniest comedic performances that i've seen, the other being the Kings of Comedy! This had me laughing the whole time I watched it and even after I turned it off! I wish I knew spanish because there were some parts that he would say in spanish that i didn't understand but it was still sooo funny!
1	Well Crafted Movie Vivid characters and dialog make this an excellent movie. From the script to the acting, this movie is well crafted.
1	A Good Movie All the lives of the Saints are great, which is what makes it difficult to rate movies of their lives. You would think that the movie would naturally deserve five stars, but that isn't always the case. In rating a movie on the life of a Saint, what is really being rated is the presentation of their life. This presentation of the life of St. Francis of Assisi is deserving of five stars because it shows the viewer how St. Francis embodied true conversion, faith, hope, and love. Despite this, however, I do have this criticism: the heart of St. Francis' spiritual life was the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Mass. Shockingly, however, the movie does not portray this at all! This criticism also applies to the recent movie on the life of St. Anthony of Padua, which I would likewise give five stars. These two saints wold sometimes live only off of the "food which endures to eternal life" (Jn 6:27)! Yet one wold not at all get this from the movies. This is a major disappointment. Nevertheless, though, the movie still deserves five stars, for without the gifts of repentance, faith, hope, and love, the Eucharist would be received in vain
0	Not very memorable I love Jackie Chan and all of his movies, buy I will admit this is not one of his best. It's quite bad actually, I bought it cos it was cheap and I like to own all of Jackie's movies in my collection. Not even Claire Forlani could really save this one, she looks totally out of place in this movie. I only recommend it to serious Jackie fans, I couldn't imagine anyone else getting through the whole 85 minutes
0	Uhm...Ain't we funkin Now? uhm...no I was hoping this was a rare concert of the Brothers Johnson in their hay day. This is a concert of middle aged men who physically let themselves go. The energy, synergy is just not there. This is a pass, the picture on the cover is totally misleading..
1	surpassed my expectations I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than i anticipated. David Horton is such an interesting person and it was really great to be able to follow him thru this adventure of his. Also, the movie did show aspects of Horton's life, including his classes at the local college he is a professor, his family, his running routine and his RD'ing.
1	great film! Though, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was made thirty years ago, it has a wonderful, fresh, timeless quality that keeps you intrigued and entertained. Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a father and husband, is forever changed upon experiencing a close encounter with beings from another planet, during a blackout, while in his truck, on his way to repair multiple electrical outages in his town. Roy is changed, after having this experience, and it totally turns his life on its head in his process to really understand what he encountered in the darkness, that evening. His wife, Romie (Teri Garr) and children cannot comprehend this sudden change in Roy, as he is driven to more and more unusual behavior, as the story progresses. Roy encounters Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her son, Barry (Cary Guffey), who also experienced a brush with this supernatural encounter. They are brought together by their experience, and are also divided from those around them who have not witnessed the arrival of the mysterous, night-dwelling spaceships, and the bright lights that announce their arrival. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes. They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know. Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility. What's more, this duel disc collector's edition of the film includes bonus footage that was left out of the extended version of the film, as well as a documentary that takes a closer look at the special effects and great effots that went into bringing the story to the screen. This is great for true film buffs and anyone for whom CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was a religious experience. The anecdotes are entertaining and insightful. This is truly a great introduction to the films of Steven Spielberg. Not to be missed.......
0	Beware the Warner Brothers Rip-Off Cabaret is one of the great movie musicals of all time. Unfortunately this DVD version, released in 2003 is misrepresented as a Widescreen format enhanced for Widescreen televisions. It is not. The Widescreen picture is "matted" and fills only a portion of the screen on newer HD sets. Since there is no other version available, if you love the movie this is the only way to own it. Shame on Warner Brothers for not releasing a classic like this with a pristine print that does the film justice
0	Physical quality VS content Several of the disks had physical defects which ruined the experience. I requested a replacement and received a refund. Who's stearing the ship?
0	A Pleasant Scott Western That Could Have Been More Any Western boasting the likes of Randolph Scott, Ernest Borgnine, and Lee Marvin should be an all-time great, but Stranger Wore A Gun proves that his films with Budd Boetticher were far superior to most of his films, and makes you wonder what Scott's Boetticher films would have been like if he'd had such great co-stars as he did in this film. Scott plays a former Confederate spy who joins with an old war colleague to stage a gold robbery in Arizona. Scott changes his mind, and tries to stop the robbery. George Macready, playing the bad guy, is his usual despicable self, and Marvin and Borgnine are solid as usual as two of Macready's gang. One of the problems with this film is that it was filmed for 3D, which is obnoxious and distracting, as objects and people point toward the screen for an effect which is no longer viable. The dialogue is also not as cleverly pointed as it was in Scott's better films. Stranger Wore A Gun is not a bad film, but not in Scott's top five best Westerns, and possibly not even his top ten
0	why this movie stinks In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood. In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really "love eachother". If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called "Melody", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off.
1	Fabulous set design, loved the acting, doesn't get any better than this! I have to agree with Michael La Vean's review in many ways. La Vean's review mentions that the film must have had an unlimited budget. I had this same thought throughout the entire film. You will be in heaven for 6 hours if you love extremely detailed period design & costumes (here most, possibly all - I can't remember - were filmed in the historically correct chateaux & palaces). If you adore fabulous 18th & early 19th century French interiors, which I am sadly obsessed with, then you will absolutely be entranced. It was all executed so incredibly well down to every last detail. The acting in the film was magnificent. Isabella Rossellini was incredibly charming as the character of Josephine. This was by far the best role that I've ever seen her play. Christian Clavier was so charming I developed a bit of a crush on him by the end of the movie. John Malkovich, was extremely convincing and played his role absolutely beautifully as well. I consider him to be one of the few (if not the best) great actors of this age. Gerard Depardieu played his role wonderfully. If you were to read a novel with a character similar to Napoleon you wouldn't believe it to be possible for someone to have had such a productive life in the short amount of time spent on earth. A beautiful film that I will treasure for many years! I hope that A&E will be able to continue be involved with equally beautiful films based on history!!
0	Living proof that TV personalities don't belong onstage! SPARE YOURSELF THIS EXPERIENCE! Much as I adore Gilbert & Sullivan, and could even tolerate The Hollywood Squares quiz show once upon a time, I can't figure out why anyone thought Peter Marshall would be able to contribute to a G&S production. And sure enough, he couldn't. In fact, his presence is one of the many downfalls of this production, which include mediocre choreography, a poorly designed set, unconvincing personalities, and some truly bizarre camera work. It's difficult to even sit through this embarrassing production once. You'll be better off catching a local amateur production.
0	not so speedy Really, the reason Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't a classic like the first one is because the speed storyline is not a bus, but a BOAT this time around. Do you really think a boat can go as fast as a bus? Even if a boat is fast, do you think that's more exciting than a bus avoiding danger in the city streets? I don't. What kind of amazing dangers can a boat avoid? OTHER boats? Ocean buoys? A bus with a bomb underneath it is more rewarding to watch. Speed 2 feels more like a way to cash in on the original. I watched the movie twice and wasn't satisfied either time. It's an okay movie, though. But don't expect "speed".
0	Putrid Use disc as a coaster. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. This is one of the worst films ever made...And not in a good way
0	Dissappointed! Shortcut to Nirvana: If you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic India, this is perhaps a good movie to watch. I was dissappointed! This film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the Kumbh Mela. Pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons! These "other diversions" are meant to inspire us to move beyond the material limitations. The story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me
1	Dante's Peak Of coarse this movie is great..it was made in the area in which I live.. so that makes it better.. And once again the experiance of buying thru Amazon was very good.. delivery in a timely manner and the order process is goo
0	Absolute junk! Don't waste your money. Get the following movies... Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it. Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular. Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer! Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock
1	Great Soundtrack Public Enemy's soundtrack to Spike Lee's He Got Game is some great music. Public Enemy's return after disappearing for a few years is a spellbinding concept album about the sport industry. KRS One and the Wu Tang Clan's Masta Killa make guest raps on this album. This also has another great collaboration on it. On the title track the loop sample of Buffalo Springfield continues through and the Stephen Stills starts to sing the song at the end with Flava Flav introducing him. Favorites include Resurrection ft. Masta Killa, He Got Game ft. Stephen Stills, Unstoppable ft. KRS One, Revelation 33 1/3 Revolutions, Politics of the Sneaker Pimps, What You Need Is Jesus, and Go Cat Go. Recommende
1	A Prophetic Movie? This low budget work of fiction from 1961 produced during the cold war era and blaming a shift in the earth's axis on simultaneous Atomic testing by Russia and America leads to increasing enviornmental disasters of changes in weather patterns, increasingly violent storms of high wind damage, tornadoes, thick fog banks and stifling heat that keeps increasing to well over 100 degrees! Is this beginning to sound familiar? This movie may be unintentionally the most prophetic movie ever made. Disregard the sub plot of Edward Judd having marriage problems and you have a well written documentation of today's weather changes with the unified suspicion that we are a doomed race. Ours has not been by Atomic fault, but may be due to increasing sun activity or perhaps, as this movie suggests, we are a little closer now. This science fiction scenario happens in about a month, for us it has taken years. Yet, the power of the press, with real reporters unlike the news bunnies and manni-kens that report our news today dig to get the real facts from a government hiding the truth. Why can't we get them also? All inconvenient truths aside, will someone please stop this industrial baloney and tell the truth?! Like the reporters in this picture, I really would like to know how much time is left before we burn up. Get extra copies of this film to give to your friends. Perhaps some smart fellow in Hollywood will look into it and consider producing a more modern movie with the added elements of today's conditions. All "rocks from space" movies aside, this probability has a greater implication for the future of the human race. A film of value, although today's audience will be impatient by the slow pace and low volume conversations. Despite this, it is still a film that can fill you with questions
0	Upscaled DVD at Best!!! High hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release, and I have to admit I am sadly dissapointed. The transfer is only a 'fraction' above watching a SD DVD version upscaled, which is a real shame. Buy at your own risk, or wait for a much better release, hopefully Director's Cut, remastered and all. 2.5/5 for effort. -zallap
0	I've had 1080p T2 for 3 years. There's no need to buy this expensive version. Back in 2003 T2 extreme was released which was an excellent version of the movie. Not only did it have excellent extra features, but it had the extended version which is wonderful, and a 1080p version of the original theatrical version (i.e. this one being reviewed) playable via home computer. Now, at the time the requirements were quite steep in order to view the movie, but to todays computer standards it is minimal. I watched the blu ray version at a friends house, brought over my T2 Extreme edition, played it on his computer next to the HDTV, and compared the two. There was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version. Why do I mention this? Because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras. You want the best version of T2 you can buy? Then walk yourself down to a local wal-mart and go to the $7.00 DVD rack and pick up Terminator 2: Extreme Edition. You'll want to shoot yourself if you don't do it. HECK, BY 4 OF THEM FOR THE SAME PRICE AS ONE BLU RAY VERSION! There's your Christmas presents!!
0	Over California There is a problem with the DVD, it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary
1	Classic Western Movie with an outstanding actor. This John Wayne Western movie is great. I intend to make it a part of my DVD library including other Western classics.
1	Great Season, Great TV Show, Classic! I just finished watching the DVD. I was in college when the show first came out so I watched it sporadically and missed a lot. The second season is better than the second and really solidifys the show as a classic. The writing gets even better, as does the acting and the story lines . I slowly became more absorbed in the show and am dying for the third season to be released. I see that it was supposed to be released already and hope it will be soon.
0	Pointless... Obviously, the only reason Disney had for making this movie was to test their newly created CAPS animation system, because other than a few impressive uses of that, this forgettable sequel has nothing more to offer. While The Rescuers remains one of the studios most beloved animated, this one simply falls way back being one of the most uninteresting and bland Disney releases of all time
1	Amazing footage for the shipwreck that is the TITANIC Follow director James Cameron as he dives into the deep ocean dephs to find the famous shipwreck that is the TITANIC. Cameron's film shows footage that has never been seen before. Watch Cameron and his crew dive all the way to the ship that was supposed to be UNSINKABLE. Cameron takes you on a jouney that you will never forget! He and his crew take you to the Grand Staircase, Molly Brown's State Room and other places that have not been seen before. When James Cameron and his crew are exploring the Titanic they end up loosing both of their robots that go inside the ship. They eventully find their robots and return to the surface from exploring the greatest shipwreck of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	More torturous sports from Todd Solondz In "Palindromes" Solondz has found another novel way to tell us how miserable and futile life can be. He's great at pinpointing where it hurts, but I think I'm ready to call the doctor. There's a scene in Preston Sturges' "The Lady Eve" where Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck are on the deck of a cruise ship, and Henry Fonda is staring out over the water saying something like, "I feel like I've known you all my life. I keep meeting you, etc." "Palindromes" stretches that idea over 110 minutes, using a young girl who desperately wants to get pregnant portrayed by eight different actresses. When she's finally successful, you'll be mumbling to yourself, "This is so wrong. This is so wrong." Solondz reportedly wanted Heather Matarazzo to reprise her role as Dawn Weiner from "Welcome to the Dollhouse" for this film; when she declined Solondz had her character commit suicide.
1	Great movie. Andy Griffith will never be the same. Great movie on the power of the media that still resonates today. Griffith and Patricia Neal give great performances. Well written and well acted.
0	She's a better singer than comedian I loved Borat, the Jackass movies, the Clerks movies...all offensive humor but very very funny. So I thought I would like this. I hated it! The so called jokes just didn't work. I don't think it's even the jokes themselves, but her timing, delivery, and especially her attitude of look at me, I'm so funny and bad! She's not original, just a complete gimmick with PR as slick as her black hair. How much did audience members get paid to laugh? Or maybe it's just a laugh track because the camera hardly shows the audience. It was a waste of my money and minutes of my life that I will never get back. Comedy isn't supposed to put you in a bad mood. How could I not have noticed that 87 people are trying to get rid of copies? I won't bother trying to resell it. I'm just going to throw it in the trash and watch Borat for some comic relief.
0	poor mr. king,will they ever get one of his short stories right?? so bad that i will just say this,read the book night shift and find out what this movie should of and could of been!!! skip this mess!
1	spongebo never gets old i thought this one was hilarious my favorite episode was squrille jokes. spongebob does stand up at the krusty krab.His first few lokes were lousy so spongebob starts looking around for anything to make a joke about and he sees sandy the squrille and he makes fun of her so every one thinks she is dumb. i thought it was so funny. I think everyone should get this movie if there a spongebob fan. And adults if you think im not going to waste money on a talking sponge and listen to his kiddy jokes. Well you should get it cause there is a lot of jokes that kids dont understand but adults do
0	Defective, may be Pirated and misleading Title First of all the DVD inside is not the famous "36th Chamber of Shaolin". It is "Return to the 36th Chamber", sequel to the original movie. The Video quality is so poor that I think it is a pirated copy. I cannot believe Amazon can sell such item.
1	We Still Love Rocky I figured I would watch this movie on a Lark...We all know the jokes about rocky and infinite sequels. The days leading up before I saw the movie, I would chant "Rocky, Rocky" to my girlfriend (not a fan). I was all but prepared for the comic spoofs I was going to make afterward...but then something happened. As I watched the movie all jokes feel aside when I realized that this was the best Rocky ever! There was a depth and maturity to this movie, probably because we fans have been following the lives of these characters for over 30 years. There was almost an intimate documentary like quality to the picture. One can almost see themselves in Philly, going up to Rocky and shaking his hand. This character is that real. When you watch this final installment, you will realize why you originally were drawn to the Rocky movies and character 30 years ago. Rocky is all about heart and the triumph of the human spirit. And he is all about being true to himself and this movie is all about being true to the fans. Check out this Movie.
1	This has a some memorable moments Murphy was at his best in this. This was the era where Eddie Murphy was the "it" guy. Everything he did turned to gold. And back then, this was gold. Samuel L. Jackson was unknown in the eighties even though he was earning his living out of acting in Hollywood films. At the beginning of this movie he plays the father of Eddie Murphy whose raw, cutting edge humor raises eyebrows and complete silence amongst his family. I have watched "Raw" many times and found it very funny to a point. The last 25 minutes are kind of dull, and not much, if any laughs but it's pretty much a laugh riot up until the last 25 minutes or so. The funniest parts include the Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor imitations, and the part about Eddie wanting a McDonald's hamburger as a kid. Even when it loses its momentum toward the end, I still watch this disc just for that.
0	Lemmings, I Think Not! Why is it that studios think they know what we like, and even if we don't like, they know best and we should follow as "Lemmings" right over the cliff's edge. This is a classic movie and deserves to be released in it's original movie-release ratio, in other words, WIDESCREEN. I can deal with "Colorization" by turning off the color (If I so desire), but with Pan & Scan treatment of a movie, the only other alternative is to not buy the P&S version. I choose the latter. I still have a laser-disc copied to VHS version that is in it's original aspect ratio, and I will just have to dig this out of the closet. I have a brand new(Bought 3yrs ago)VHS player still in the box, just for this purpose. Wake up Hollywood, don't be a bunch of schmucks, make P&S disappear forever!!! CG13
1	Romero, please forgive me!!! As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, "Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives." Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks "punch." But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add "soul" to this film about the "souless" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the "Apocalypse," he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great "fifth-act conversion"!! What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!! The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the "real" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this "problem" with Boyle's 28 Days Later . . . in America we received the "happy" ending and weeks later, the "unhappy" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!) Hey, even if you don't dig close-examination of film (not everyone does!!) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it!! It will not disappoint!!! And prepare for Synder's new film: 300!! It looks dazzling!
1	Its sad that the hell raiser debut and hellbound were the only great hell raisers. For Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), the nightmares never end. Still fresh in her fevered memory of her father's skinned corpse, the evil machinations of her uncle Frank's reanimated body and the unspeakable perversity of the Cenobites. But the worst is yet to come. From beyond the Outer Darkness, from the darkest regions of the imagination comes Hellbound: Hellraiser II. Don't bother with the other hell raisers their just plain crap & boring
0	A Dog in name and quality Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets
0	Typical Errors Like so many things produced and published about the Third Reich, there is an all too familiar error here. It's in the AMAZON product description. The WAFFEN SS were NOT (!!!!) the "black clad" men. That was the ALGEMEINE SS. The WAFFEN SS were the actual MILITARY branch of the SS and were (still are) recognized and some of the best trained and fighting soldiers in military history. The "black clad" ALEGEMEINE is what made up the infamous GESTAPO, Hitler's personal bodyguard, the SD and most of the internal SS force in Germany and the occupied territories. The regular army panzer troops wore the black uniforms, but they were NOT part of the SS. The WAFFEN SS wore the field gray and camouflaged uniforms. Yes, they were brutal, and some were part of some "questionable" activities in the war. But, they were NOT what most people think of the SS, which is the GESTAPO. This error is about as common as authors, directors, etc. calling the GERMAN army, the NAZI army or calling the LUFTWAFFE the NAZI air force. MOST German soldiers were NOT NAZIs. Yes, their GOVERNMENT leaders, for the most part, were NAZIs, but NOT the soldiers. I've even seen some people say, NAZI tanks!! I was not aware that a Tiger tank could belong to a political party! If AMAZON cannot get this correct in their description, what is the point of watching something like this? Do your research. DO NOT believe everything that is produced, ESPECIALLY by US writers or directors. Remember, the winners write the history. English and French produced material is more accurate and more evenly presented. I find that ironic as THEY were the ones being bombed and invaded. NOT the US!!
1	A personal cult movie! This film is very often forgotten when you make the whole account of the great American films in any age. Artur Penn made a superb sociological portrait about the chase and wishes of revenge of the crowd with interesting insights and serious connotations. This film threw the ring to Robert Redford and gave Brando another opportunity to play an unusual and magnificent role. And despite the multiple problems among Penn and the illumination supervisor according to Penn told in an interview with James Lipton in Inside the Actor's Studio, the film deserves a special place in the reduced golden list of the great American artistic triumphs.
0	Not the best Disney movie ever made but.... I'm a big fan of Disney movies, and sappy-ness doesn't bother me, but this was off the scales corny. Not much story, too much dancing around. Kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it, as it's mostly about politics, so it kind of gets lost in the middle. Buddy Ebsen, though, gives his usual stellar performance, and Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time!
0	Don't waste your time even renting it It's sad when a commercial is superior to the movie, but the boogeyman is an example of that particular reality. Even renting this film is a waste of time. Had they attempted to explain the entire thing with Tim being a schizophrenic who flipped out and killed everyone, but hallucinated the boogeyman doing it, then that would've probably saved the film, but it didn't end that way. Tim is the typical screwed up, scared of the closet kid, only about twenty years too old, being traumatized by having seen his father get mangled in the closet by the boogeyman. After posing for the first twenty minutes as having rewritten this event into just a way of dealing with his father's leaving (not very convincing, by the way), he goes home after his mother's death and decides to face his old fears by spending a night in the house he grew up in. Then follows a group of messily edited, badly written, and confusing events that make no sense and are not even remotely explained. For no apparent reason, he drags along for about an hour an old childhood friend named Kate, who conveniently keeps showing up with only flimsy contrived excuses. She rides over to his house on a horse which for no reason throws her off; he has no food so she rides her bike late at night over to bring him some. None of this would be that bad if it wasn't for the fact that the last fifteen minutes were a series of absurd events. His excessively touchy-feely girlfriend shows up, drives him to a motel, and vanishes. He goes into a closet and comes out in his old house's closet and jumps at Kate (there to give the gift of food). He goes and chats with a girl, who was following him around asking about the boogeyman who then was dead but still showing up, being a kind of spiritual advisor on destroying childhood demons. He goes into closets and appears in different buildings, sometimes under beds, gets pulled under beds and comes out closets, and something about nailing a chair in front of a closet and facing the boogeyman turns into him smashing and destroying everything in his old room as a means of destroying the boogeyman. It would have been all okay had it been the delusions of a madman, with his sudden appearances elsewhere being blackouts and flashes of memory. But no, it was supposed to be a real, non-CGI boogeyman. The result was a cheesy, boring, 90 minute film that should've ended way sooner, because even at a hour and a half, it went too long. It could've been good if it had just not tried to make the whole boogeyman thing a literal thing, but of course, they didn't. And what was that with his girlfriend? He walks through a closet and finds himself in the motel bathroom where she vanished, sees gray water pouring out of the faucet, then she pops out of the water a few times to be apparently drowned or at least repeatedly covered with splashing dirty water by some watery manifestation of, yes, the boogeyman. Then he goes to his room, with the ever present Kate, smashed a few toys, and everything was peachy. I've watched horror movies since about the age of six, a good eleven years, from Nightmare on Elm St., to the Hammer films, to Dracula (about forty of them), to Evil Dead, and this one just sucks. There are so many better horror movies to choose from.
0	Kind of a rip As others have pointed out, the group was just getting it together when the concert was filmed and it shows. While the audio is good, the performances in no way match the classic album they produced. Also, the "extras" added to fill out this fairly slight offering, particularly those for Clapton and Baker are taken from the almost equally slight Farewell Concert film made about Cream. For die hard fans and completists only
1	VERY OLD BUT VERY GOOD CONSIDERING WHEN THIS MUSICAL WAS MADE, IT IS A GREAT FORERUNNER TO THE LATER BROADWAY MELODY FILMS. IT IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE REMAKE WITH LANA TURNER AND JOAN BLONDELL. IN MY OPINION BROADWAY MELODY OF 1936 WAS THE BEST BROADWAY MELODY MADE. YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM BROADWAY MELODY OF 1929, IN AS MUCH AS IT PRESENTED ITSELF WITH A LOT OF VIGOR, GOOD CAST AND MUSIC WHICH FOR ITS DAY SURELY HAD MOVIE GOERS WONDERING WHEN OTHER MUSICALS WERE COMING. IF YOU ARE A MOVIE MUSICAL BUFF BE SURE TO INCLUDE BROADWAY MELODY OF 1929 IN YOUR COLLECTION
0	I Know Fred twoo The personality of a Nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance. Fred Leuchter was painted as such by many people, some who knew him(and I'm guessing knew better) and as we may be witnessing others who didn't. Brownshirts insult, assault, rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas. Maybe a major lesson of the Holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to. So long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas. There must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist, so that they may prove their allegiance to the group. Maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent, as dissent does not equal disloyalty...except in a Nazi state. There was a great free press in Germany in Nazi times, so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries. "Mr. Death" is not representation of Fred Leuchter. Fred Leuchter is representation of Fred Leuchter. Might I suggest NOT suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary. That's not clarification, that's reinforcement of one idea. Rather go and find Fred and speak to him. Get his view. If you don't have a preformed agenda (like Van Pelt or Morris), you may get him to respond like I did. I found a different Fred(and a much much different story) than I was given by director Morris and others. The question is not whether German gas chambers were used to murder people, the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that, or any other idea. That is, without having his house firebombed, a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place, have his reputation ruined, or any of the other stuff happen. If Fred's ordeal is any indication, the brownshirts are alive and well, but I don't think Fred is one of them. The one fact I would alter in my previous post is Rabbi Bauer's support for "no gas chambers". Bauer supported Fred's methods, not necessarily his conclusion. I tried in vain to contact Bauer, on where he differs with Fred. Fred has high regard for Rabbi Bauer. The Polish forensic investigation(which came soon after Fred's!) did not come to the same conclusion as Fred, but did essentially duplicate Fred's data collection methods and results. There was testimony at the Nuremburg trials by both inmates and German staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in Germany. In 1960, physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there. It took 16 years(1976) for Simon Weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those German concentration camps. A former inmate at Auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there. But all this isn't to say that the Auschwitz gassings didn't occur, but rather to simply say that some may think they didn't occur and for that they shouldn't be condemned...unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like Fred
1	Maugham's Famous Story & Swanson's Finest Silent Performance During his lifetime Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) was best known for such novels as OF HUMAN BONDAGE and such plays as THE CIRCLE; today, however, he is chiefly recalled for his short stories, of which the 1921 "Miss Thompson" is easily the most famous. The original story was soon adapted for the stage under the title RAIN--and it was a tremendous success. The play has been performed countless times and continues to be revived on a consistent basis; there have also been three major screen adaptations. The best of these is the 1928 silent film SADIE THOMPSON starring Gloria Swanson (1897-1983.) Swanson was perhaps the first Hollywood "Diva," an actress as controversial as she was popular. By the late 1920s her liaison with the infamous Joe Kennedy (father of John, Robert, and Ted) gave her the clout to become her own producer, and with Kennedy money behind her she selected the Maugham story and cast herself in the title role. It was an inspired choice. Swanson had somewhat hard features and tremendous attitude, and many consider that this is her best overall performance. The story concerns the collision of a brash prostitute (Swanson) and a holier-than-thou minister (Lionel Barrymore) who find themselves trapped by quarantine and monsoon rains in a rundown hotel on Pago-Pago. Needless to say, the sparks fly--especially when Davidson pressures the island govenor to deport Sadie as soon as possible. But it gradually transpires that Davidson may have more than one reason for wanting Sadie gone: it may be that he finds her a temptation himself. SADIE THOMPSON would be Swanson's last great success in the silent era--the later QUEEN KELLY was never finished or widely released. But like most other silent films, it was buried by the advent of sound, and over the years the final ten or fifteen minutes of the film was completely lost. Without a conclusion, it was rarely shown even after interest in silent films revived. Fortunately, Kino has been able to restore the conclusion with a mixture of film fragments, stills, and title card recreations, and the brazen Sadie, the dour Dr. Davidson, and the statement made about intolerance, tempation, and hypocrisy live and breathe once more. The picture quality shows age, but on the whole it is quite good and probably the best available short of digital restoration. The bonuses are slight but interesting, including comparisons of key scenes from the original story, the playscript, the 1928 Swanson version, and the 1932 Joan Crawford version, which was titled RAIN. (Comparison with the 1953 Rita Hayworth version, titled MISS SADIE THOMPSON, is not made; this version, however, is negligable.) KINO Video has done a tremendous job of restoring, preserving, and once more making this memorable film available. If you're a fan of Maugham, Swanson, or silent film in general, SADIE THOMPSON is a must-have. GFT, Amazon Reviewe
1	Pain Relief... Thank you God! Finally, the looong wait is over! A decent sequel to the first two movies! Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is back! She's 20 years older (yet, still beautiful), tougher, and wiser. Laurie now works at a private school in California, where she struggles to forget that night in 1978. Her son John (Josh Hartnet) is enrolled in the same school and must face the very devil that haunts / hunts his mum. Though there is a relatively low body count, H2O delivers good suspense and more intelligence than the idiotic sequels 4-6 (I don't consider H3 a sequel). H2O is the perfect finalé to the trilogy. Unfortunately, HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION exists now, and I'm sure that hollywood will crank out fifty more just like it...
1	excellent I really liked this anime. A lot. Especially the music. It's so... haunting. So of course I had to get my hands on the entire soundtrack. Go get "Key to Twilight". Sometimes I just watched the thing to get the music. That's not to downplay the goodness of the anime mind you. It was good. The only thing that made me sad was the open ending of the anime. You have to play the vid game for the entire storyline. And that sucks because as my husband says "I have no game power." I had so many game overs I lost my passion for the game. I still don't know how it ends. -sigh
1	Bad Education Excellent Spanish movie, that really reflects the consequences and attitudes of our modern Catholic church, not only in one country, but in several around the world.The storyline is poignant and sometimes extremely cruel, but, Isn't real life like that???The performances are absolutely faultless and the script magnificently well adapted from the original book,the director, one of the best.But please have an open mind when you see it, and don't try to imitate what you are about to see
0	A (very) poor man's "Scream" Featuring George Clooney in an early role and Maureen McCormick (Marcia Marcia *Marcia* Brady) in a comeback role, of sorts. Also featuring a confusing metafictional plot, flat humor, and mostly bad acting. "Return" is yet another slasher-movie-about-slasher-movies. There were several of them made during the eighties, most of which now claim to have been the inspiration for "Scream." None of them were as good as that movie, however, and "Return" is no exception. Although the movie has its moments -- a scene of a cop creeping down a murky hallway whereabouts the killer may be lurking is tense -- there aren't enough of them to sustain the proceedings. If you watch just to see Clooney and McCormick, be forewarned that the former gets bumped off early (first, in fact), and despite a valiant effort McCormick's cop who gets turned on by all the carnage is a joke that just doesn't work
0	Creature Comforts - The Complete First and Second Seasons This items came to us broken during shipping so we could not watch it
0	Great Music; Horrible DVD! Most people writing reviews for this DVD are focusing on the music and performances which I agree are great BUT unfortunately the DVD which I am reviewing was lousy. The editing was extremely ridiculous. You would be hard-pressed to find an instance of an image that lasted more than a second. It was more like 5 per second (OK that may be a slight--VERY SLIGHT-- exaggeration). This a trend in concert video editing that is evident here in the nth degree. Terrible! The images come at you like a machine gun. Please support this band by buying their CDs but unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old on speed skip this DVD
0	is this a joke? i almost broke up with my girlfriend for picking out this movie at blockbuster. i cant even put into words how bad this movie was, i really wonder what the people who made this were thinking
0	really, really, really bad First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad. I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face.
1	CAT IN THE HAT I LAUGHED.....I CRIED........I WROTE BAD CHECKS!!!! FUN MOVIE!!! MY KIDS AND I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED IT
0	messed with the original VHS release, made it worse Loren Michels ruins most things he touches. they left out the "Hot Tub" sketch, where eddie play's as the late, great James Brown. it may be one of THE most funny sketches in the history of television!!!! I could see that thing 100 times and i would still laugh as hard as the first time seeing it! i stand buy the greatness of that sketch, SNL was riding the Eddie Murphy thing all the way to the bank ( the show would most likley been canceled, in my opinion, the show was unwatchable without him an piscapo teamed up). then to make this thing worse is that the VHS version had zero Gumby sketches in it ( still great without it thought). i see they have a Gumby sketch in the dvd version, i think "oh, cool, a Gumby dammit segment", but it ends up being one of the lamest one's around. what, they didn't want to pay piscapo the royalties for showing the one where Gumby goes on Letterman (Piscapo as letterman)? do everyone a favor and don't purchase this watered down version....Delirious just came out. get that instead. that is GARUNTEED to make u laugh! this dvd....meeeeh!
1	Air America I consider this one of Robert Downey Jr. better movies and you have to say that Mel Gibson did a wonderful job as well
0	The Mean Streets of Sweden... I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be expecting from a "classic eploitation/revenge" film, but if this is it I'd say the genre died a just death. As many reviewers have pointed out, there are simply fatal problems with this film. The sex scenes are utterly awful, like they are from an instructional film. Christina Lindberg is beautiful, but don't expect any thrills from her outside of some decent lesbian scenes. The lack of music and sound create a claustrophobic feel, but with this kind of film I can never tell if that's intentional or just the result of piss-poor production values. The "action" scenes are almost all in slow-motion which is simply too slow and robs the scenes of any sense of real violence. I don't know why people go for this kind of movie. I think Tarentino has some sort of complex: He feels guilty for using the kind of production values he does, while the movies he grew up on looked and sounded like this one. He should get over it though, there's nothing wrong with a movie that looks and sounds good, and doesn't make you feel akward while you watch it. There's little "rough" or "shocking" in this movie, its just not very well done. It's interesting as a period piece, and its cool that I have a limited edition (though it is not numbered as other reviewers have pointed out), don't think of this as an investment though, in a few more years, no one's going to care...
0	don't let the 'widescreen collection' label fool you The rating is for the DVD, not the movie (I'd give the movie ten stars if I could). On my widescreen TV (Sony Bravia 40" LCD), to watch this movie with the correct aspect ration, I have to watch it in full frame mode, which puts black bars not only on the left and right of the screen but, since this is a 'widescreen' DVD, there are black bars on the top and bottom as well. Apparently, when this DVD was released, you could just throw black bars on the top and bottom of the picture and call something 'widescreen.' Next year is the 20th anniversary of the movie's release, hopefully they have an update planned
1	Hetty Wainthroop Investigates, Series 1 & 2 The Hetty Wainthroop Series is a very special treat for my Wife and I. We lived in England for six years with the United States Air Force and truly appreciate English productions. Patricia Routledge is an outstanding actress and this particular series truly brings out the best in her career----a great investment
0	Awful Well I decided to buy my first Girls Gone Wild video (The Seized Video) and it was a waste of my time and money. I hope th other ones are better than this because it was useless. The girls were good looking no doubt but its not that long of a video, the camera guys are idiots and act like twelve year old boy's. I thought this was going to be a good adult video but it is way over rated trust me. Wasted my money and spent thirty minutes of my life I will never get back.
1	Mean Machine A British translation of "The Longest Yard," using Soccer instead of american football. It is a fun little movie, with typical Brit humor
1	Good Job I rec'd the item in just a couple of days and was very pleased with the service.. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!
0	Terrible movie! I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago. I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm. Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie
1	I agree with all the comments I have seen this movie in French few years ago and I have always considered that it was a good movie about India of the years 1850-1900. Radjah, Princesses, Officers, Soldiers, Merchants, Costumes, Music, Elephant, Cobra, British Pride, long sandy roads, battles, etc. it is a long saga. Some time too slow but it is a good one
0	Zombie baby is too much I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much. All taboos have been broken there is nothing left. Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore
1	Amazing workout Once again, Adam Ford amazes me with his skills and knowledge with the swiss ball. If you purchased any of his other workout DVDs, you will not be disappointed with this volume. Once again, he breaks the workout in three levels. Trust me, start with the easiest level and work your way up to the hardest. His exercises are extremely difficult to do, but the payoff is amazing. You will gain functional strength and stabilty control like you wouldn't believe. I've been workout for years, using different modality, (e.g. bands, free weights, calisthetics, cable machines, medicine balls, BOSU, stability balls) and I thought I could manage the hardest level...NOT!!! I tried one of the harder exercises and almost fell on my face. Take my word for it, this will make a great addition to anyone's workout library and for anyone who might be bored with their current workouts and want to change things up alittle
0	Ricky Martin Unplugged I returned this product to you as it was all in Spainish. It wasn't asvertized as so. All other purchases I've made from you get 5 Stars! I'm a very satisfied customer
0	Hollywood costume epic, drama over substance This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive. Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked? Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events. The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty. They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra. She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here? I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome. Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance. Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material. Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama. This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit. The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama. The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great.
1	A Funny Train from Somewhere Sad A funny look at a dramatic world through the eyes of railway workers in a small town in wartime Czechoslovakia. I enjoyed watching this movie, it really is a hopeful and humorous story about human beings in times of turmoil. This is Czechoslovakia during World War II. The Nazis are officially in control, and actively imposing their bureaucracy on the nation. Our protagonist is young Milos Hrma, whose father is a retired railway man, and spends the day sitting at home, looking at his watch, and telling everyone where each train in now. He encourages his son to find employment at the local village railway depot. Easily the youngest employee at the depot, Milos wants to fit in, be admired, be a man. He wears the uniform of a train dispatcher, but doesn't seem comfortable in it yet. While other reviewers have mentioned young Milos' talk of wanting to have sex, which is actually quite funny in its stark honesty, much can be lost in our descriptions. This is a comedy, not a prurient display. It seems that sex is simply the path Milos believes he must take to be a man. It is his naivety and honesty with his fellow railway employees that makes the whole deal such a riot. This self-created drama keeps his mind off of what is happening around him. Some may be offended by this, in which case I'd suggest you'd probably be happier buying a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD. Milos does show himself a man...and it has little to do with s-e-x. Very worth watching! Some of the scenes are terrific--I liked the scene where Milos goes up to kiss the female conductor as the train is about to pull away and then...oh, I won't ruin it for you! It really is a funny film set in a heartbreaking time. All the more interesting that it was shot in 1966. Reccommended for comedy buffs and railway workers everywhere. I wish that sort of exitement happened on my train! :
1	DVD! AT LAST!!! I've been waiting for this film on DVD for years! Thank goodness, It's here and won't disappoint. Clean crisp and sharp with great sound quality! As a film it is a true piece of ART with some of the best performances ever assembled! I lived in Waxahachie where much of the film was shot and was in the "Heart" house as it is called. Believe me, the cinematography in this film is worth the price of the DVD! Texas never looked better! This film would make a terrific companion piece to "The Trip to Bountiful" which was also filmed around the Waxahachie, Texas area. "Places" on DVD! It's about time! Now how about "Bountiful" on DVD
0	Not for improvement... This DVD is not an instructional DVD. You won't learn anything with it. There is few tabs of riffs that Flea is playing in it, but they realy are no use... This DVD is fun if you would like to see Flea when he was younger and if you like this guy. This inverviewer is boring and looks like he will fall asleep any minute... If you want to improve your playing, purchase something else. If you wan't to have a good laugh and look some cool jamming that you won't learn to play, this might be for you..
1	Savage Cusack Cusack plays Hoops in a role that can best be described as a typical John Cusack role. Demi Moore plays a supporing role/love interest for Cusack is a way that is very different for Demi. If you are a fan of Cusack, Savage Steve Holland, or 80s movies then you will like this. Similar to "Better Off Dead.
1	"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity." "But I know none, and therefore I am no beast." Richard III, Act 1, Scene 2 Francis Dollarhyde has to be one of the more disturbing and chilling villains in modern day literature and cinema. Abused and damaged as a child to a point where only a series of rudimentary, barely functioning social masks takes the place of a whole man, Dollarhyde hides the savage pathology of a serial killer who annihilates entire families to fuel his twisted desire and impossible longing. Although "Manhunter" is less true to Thomas Harris' book "Red Dragon," and the 2002 film version with the same name, I found it to be a vastly superior film. Despite its retro `80's fashion and the distinctive pastels and sun-drenched look of Michael Mann's work during his Miami Vice television series days, you will find a film that cuts through the meat, slicing through the bone and exposing the marrow. Tom Noonan's performance has to be one of the most haunting and pitiable on celluloid. Noonan delivers the tortured, damaged and ultimately unsalvageable soul of Francis Dollarhyde in a way that even Harris' book didn't convey. He is a howling soul in Hell--a grotesque who is driven by his delusions. William Peterson is Will Graham, a former FBI profiler, who retired after a near death encounter in apprehending the notorious and now incarcerated Hannibal Lector (played by a wonderfully sinister and reptilian Brian Cox). When Graham's former handler, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), asks him to help him profile the murderer, Graham visits Lector in his jail cell, to recover the mind-set necessary to track the killer. In doing so, Graham incurs Lector's wrath and his collusion with the very killer Graham is pursuing, bringing him far closer to the case than he anticipated. Joan Allen absolutely shines as Reba McClane, the blind girl who has the misfortune to be attracted to Francis Dollarhyde and who unwittingly serves as Dollarhyde's last connection to his vanishing humanity. Early on in their relationship, Dollarhyde takes Reba to a veterinarian who is set to cap a sedated tiger's tooth. Watching Reba's facial expressions as she ran her hands along the tiger's fur and listened to the beating of its heart, with tears streaming down her face, was almost painful. Dollarhyde watches her from a corner in the room and seems to experience something akin to an emotional release from her experience. It is one of the strangest and most erotically charged scenes I've ever seen in a film. When I first saw this film in its theatrical release, I remember thinking, "Thanks a lot, Michael Mann, you've totally ruined Iron Butterfly's Inna Gadda De Vida for me. Now I'm never going to be able to hear this great song from my youth without feeling vaguely frightened." Even so, the sound track for the film contains some of the most eerily beautiful music from `80's groups like Red 7, Prime Movers and Shriekback, which Mann has integrated flawlessly into the film. "Manhunter" might annoy some viewers who remember only too well the big hair and bad fashion of the 1980's. However, if you can manage to put these aside, I think you will find an often overlooked and intense gem of a thriller
1	Swing Shift I love this movie it is fun loving and heart warming it is a great movie that brings back a time when every thing was simple even in war time. It makes you want to laugh and cry with the characters and it shows that women can take up the reins and be just as capable as me
1	Oscar Winning Comedy John Cleese brought his Monty Python insanity and "Fawlty Towers" confusion to A FISH CALLED WANDA, a hilarious caper film about a diamond heist and all the double-crosses that come with it. What I really appreciate about the film is that comedy FINALLY got its due: Kevin Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his inspired portrayal of Otto, the intense but dense hit man who loves spouting philosophy but can't hide his overwhelming ignorance of everything else. Twenty years later, I still laugh out loud at his performance. I believe Michael Palin won the British Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as well--and he's hilarious as well! (I've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged: Peter Sellers should have won for DR. STRANGELOVE and Steve Martin should've been at least nominated for ALL OF ME and then nominated for Best Supporting Actor for LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.) Everything about WANDA works, even the little winks such as the name of Cleese's character, Archibald Leech--which was Cary Grant's real name (Grant and Cleese both come from the same part of England). A FISH CALLED WANDA is a comedy worthy of serious study. No kidding
0	Big Diappointment I would NOT recommend buying this DVD. Poor production value and if you are expecting to enjoy some music by Christina prepare yourself for disappointment and boredom. It's about 90% PR people ranting about Christina and her accomplishments. I admire Christina's music and her God given talent for singing along with her hard work but this DVD is definitely worth passing up. I would recommend the Stripped Concert in the UK but NOT this one
0	Defective Set I bought this DVD set as a Christmnas gift for my sister, who is a huge fan of the show. Unfortunately, she never got a chance to fully enjoy it. We bought and returned this set twice. At least one of the DVD's in both sets was defective. And even when we purchased this item in a retail store, we ran into the same problem. So, avoid purchasing this product. It looks like this is one of those items that has a chronic problem and the company that produces it doesn't even have the decency to make a recall
0	'Fear as subtle entertainment' *PLOT REVEALED* An utterly worthless foray into English overbearance and haughtiness, this film marks Hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment' in the pre-War 1930's. Working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in London to indoctrinate subordinate English audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of Germany, Hitchcock eases the tension by making this a "comedy". Wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness (the scene at an Austrian Hotel where the boring Brits are talking about Cricket and drinking tea), he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations, the fight scene in the baggage cart for example. His support for the upper Brit classes is especially drab and tedious, meandering between hero worship and idolatry, not to mention the wooden acting of the actors. The story concerns a "secretive plot" about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the Austrian Alps, simplistic, innocuous even but Hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue doesn't want to think she imagined it all. Of course, she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men'. Immature plot? Definately. Banter, insipid and devoid of any vivacity, is exchanged between high brow English snobs in the most elusive way, bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train. This is nourishment for those who can't think very well. The story continues until the stuffy, pretentious, oaf-like English on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema, the Brits, debating the attack itself for 5 minutes in proper English, sit there in front of open windows, with one gun and hold off 24 well armed foreign agents for 20 minutes. Also in this scene, the 80 year old woman "spy", jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily, how 24 well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate, or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off. If you can believe in the superiority of British snobs, then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film. Of course you can guess the ending, the woman falls in love with the English chap who helped her on the train, and England is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact, an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid 1930's but most audiences will take this as merely a "thriller" instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda.
0	If Turbulence Can't break your onboard Implausibility Meter Nothing WILL! Too bad I can not give Turbulence no stars. This movie is just filled with way too many things that just stretch even the most liberal imaginations well past the limits of reality! The whole movie just does not work. The FBI agents are too easily overcome and out smarted by a self professed genius serial killer whose one dimensional actions make his IQ seem incredibly average to me. Rather than being very smart the serial killer seemed a self absorbed slob who is overly impressed with his own lame exploits. The rest of the airplane passengers seem like fawns or sheep. Logic suggests when transporting a dangerous horde of hardened criminals the crew would be a select group of individuals hand picked for their skill at dealing with a plane full of diseased brilliant minded malefactors. The plot is obviously concocted to introduce fawn like ladies and foppish men into the mix so the audience has a heightened thrill factor. Problem is the other non-law enforcement passengers seem inserted into the plot for no good reason other than their role as pawns to be used by the serial killer to drag an otherwise painfully predictable lifeless story along to its all too formulaic end. Also the Christmas lights festooned all over the plane when you are carrying hardcore prisoners is so over the top that you must wonder what the heck were the writers thinking. Most hardcore prisoners are quite intelligent and could certainly turn all those dangling Christmas lights to their advantage in some vile criminal way. No FBI agent or corrections officer worth his or her salt would let a prisoner set foot in a plane that had so many opportunities for prisoners to escape their direct care custody and control. Also the most glaring flaw in Turbulence occurs when even the most basic tenants of maintaining care custody and control of violent malignant inmates were overlooked again and again. The Plane skimming over buildings through rooftops into structures was just plain stupid. While most tall buildings roof top garden rooms and associated elements are lightly constructed they must stand up to high winds. Add that buildings the plane was scraping had mechanical equipment towers where strong girders and supports reside that should have broken the plane up or at least damaged it more than was shown. It is like the writers of Turbulence were a bunch of college drama students drunk and totally detached from reality got challenged to come up with a disaster thriller plot. Drama for drama's sake without any plausible relationship to reality is not thrilling or action adventure it is just disjointed stupid garbage. Turbulence is just garbage to watch when you have time to waste. If you want real suspense on a plane get Air Force One. Turbulence is an invitation to take a round trip to and from Palooka-Ville, the plane has plenty of seats available but who cares!. This Turbulence is just a bumpy ride that leaves you feeling sick. I can think of better ways to spend time.
1	They're not just getting rich... They're getting even. Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd star in this great 80's comedy flick that never gets old, I seriously have seen this film so many times and each time it gets funnier with each viewing especially with the little things that you tend to miss during the first time. The scene where Louise (Dan Aykroyd) wakes up in his own bed in the following morning after a terrible experience and tells his buttler in a very snoby accent that he had this awful nightmare where this negro... and then he sees Eddie Murphy's character next to him smilling had me bursting with tears of laughter, the comedic timing in this film was perfect I highly recomend this film.
1	One of my alltime favorite comedies................. The Dukes experiment to trade Eddie Murphy's derelict lifestyle for Dan Aykroyd's sheltered corporate life was genius. To make matters worse lets not forget how much the experiment's bet was worth
1	Pleasantly surprised Low production value but excellent information on how to expand pleasure. The woman is "au natural" and shows a very simple way to touch herself which I first looks like it is too simple. But once we experimented with it, it sure gives great results. It is quite different from anything else that I have seen. The precision of what she is doing is surprising but undeniable once I saw the signs in her body. If you are looking for a slick production like the one from the big companies, or something equivalent to how pleasure is presented from a man's perspective in a porn movie, this is not for you and you will be disappointed. But if you are willing to look past that and use the example of a real woman (not a model that fits everyone criteria of perfect beauty with large breast, shaved genitalia etc. and I shall say I myself would enjoy seeing more women like her that look more like most of us presented as role models) and if you are willing to look at the information offered about a woman's pleasure you may very well be pleasantly surprised. I definitively was.
0	Inept movie still entertaining as a curiosity First, I'd like to correct one of the other reviewers, who said that SNITCH'D is about a "Latino cop" who goes undercover as a high school student. Actually, the cop (played by writer/director James Cahill) looks Asian but is supposed to be white. He's certainly not supposed to be Latino. We know this because one of the students calls him a Spanish name, and Cahill's character has to ask a fellow student what he was called. "White boy," she replies. Also, I don't think the movie is set in East L.A. The credits say it was shot in Santa Ana, a heavily Latino city in the middle of Orange County, which is just south of Los Angeles County. Yes, the movie is inept and unrealistic. Many of the actors playing these high school students look well into their twenties. The guns look like toys. Sound like it too. When they're dropped or tossed aside, you can hear the hollow plastic clatter on the floor. Yet this movie is entertaining, in a weirdly "what were they thinking," endearing sort of way. Star-writer-director Cahill smirks his way through much of the film, like he's trying to play a suave James Bond type. You look at him and think, this inept, non-charismatic Asian-playing-a-white-guy actually imagines he's the next Rambo/tough guy/action hero. Especially funny is his pursed lips and staring eyes when he sneaks around the house with his gun in "action hero" fashion. Cahill is morbidly funny! And yes, his "martial arts" is as inept as the film's toy guns. He grabs a guy's head and repeatedly "slams" it against a desk in what's supposed to be a quick "jack-hammer" fashion ... only it's slow, and the victim's head clearly isn't making contact with the table. The victim seems to just go along with having his head banged against the desk, because director Cahill told him to. Also funny is when Cahill uses martial arts to defeat some eight gun-totting ganstas, partly with the aid of ping-pong paddles. One "actress," when she's acting "sad" and telling Cahill about her recently deceased friend, seems to be actually smiling. This film is probably being seen only because its female lead, Eva Longoria, has become famous on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, although she isn't much better in this film than the rest of the cast. Some, but not much. Then again, it must have been hard for the twentysomething Longoria to play a high school student swept off her feet by Cahill, or mouth his script's cliche-ridden relationship dialogue. Their "flirting" in the library is another very funny moment! They're supposed to be teenagers, yet their relationship dialogue sounds written for adults, who in turn got their lines from bad romantic comedies. I said this film is endearing. I have a soft spot for amateurs who buy a camcorder and think they can make a Hollywood style feature. Although I think this was shot on super-8 or 16mm film. That's because you can hear a camera whirring in some of the shots. And there's a soft, shot-on-film-then-blown-up look. So although this film is inept enough to merit only one star, I'm giving it another one for unintentional humor, Longoria eye candy, and the effort of getting it finished
0	ugh I've seen many films from all over the world including Bollywood but "Devdas" is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards, so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in Bollywood films. Its two hours too long and the leads have the emptiest faces likely to be seen on the screen
1	Pleasant performances, &quot;charming&quot; film In the early 19th century, a woman in foreign garb is found walking the English countryside. Her language is a mystery. Is she the lost princess of South Pacific island, a lunatic, or someone else entirely? This is the central question of Princess Caraboo, whose title character is wonderfully played by the alternatively child-like and proud Phoebe Cates. Kevin Kline and John Lithgow deliver very funny performances as, respectively, the suspicious Greek butler of the family that &quot;adopts&quot; Caraboo and a professor called in to determine whether she's a fraud. Through it all, Stephen Rea provides a quiet, consistent presence as a journalist fascinated by Caraboo's story, whatever it may really be (though Rea's hair is disturbingly similar to Richard Simmons' here). This is a good rental film, filled both with these performances and gorgeous scenes of the English countryside. And it is not without a relevant message: do we not hope that those around us may turn out to be more than they seem, so that we may either profit by our association with them or, if they turn out to be infamous, come out looking superior? A pleasant 4-star diversion
0	Hollywood costume epic, drama over substance This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive. Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked? Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events. The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty. They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra. She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here? I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome. Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance. Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material. Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama. This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit. The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama. The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great.
1	Excellant Video This DVD would benafit anyone wanting to learn more about Chakras- from beginner to very experienced. The graphics were wonderful. I would recommend this to all my Chakra Students
0	Nose Dive to Oblivion When David Rabe's play "Hurlyburly" opened on Broadway in August 1984, it was directed by Mike Nichols. It ran for 343 performances -- a long Broadway run -- and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. William Hurt was nominated for Best Actor in his role as Eddie. Judith Ivey who recently appeared in the Clint Eastwood film "Flags of our Fathers" won the Tony as Featured Actress in a play. The rest of the cast included Harvey Keitel as Phil, Cynthia Nixon as Donna, Ron Silver as Mickey, Jerry Stiller as Artie and Sigorney Weaver as Darlene. It's easy to see why a producer would want to bring this to the screen. With lead actors Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey & Anna Paquin, there are four Oscars to make this an award-winning cast. Perhaps there is a great difference from a Mike Nichols production that would bring out the ironies and balance it with comedy to this film Director Anthony Drazen who won the filmmaker's trophy @ Sundance for "Dramatic Zebrahead." Whatever the reason, the film quickly become tedious and the down-spirals into a valueless void. It is hard to deny that Sean Penn is one of the most brilliant screen actors working today. He won the Best Actor Award for this picture @ the Venice Film Festival. As Eddie, he snorts cocaine like a chain smoker, snarls, cries & puts his hand in his pants. Watching the actor bounce between highs and lows must be a qualitatively quite difference performance that William Hurt's on Broadway. Penn is worth watching. He's brilliant and makes the film worth a second star. Kevin Spacey as the manipulative Mickey is hardly endearing. Yes, compared the other guys he seems relatively together. But his separation from his wife and family are hardly touched upon in the screenplay. It leaves Spacey with a mono-level performance that, while interesting, does not move us because he doesn't change. Chazz Palminteri as the gorilla-minded Neanderthal Phil that can't control himself around women is utterly obnoxious. It's unclear why Eddie keeps him around. Perhaps to feel that he's better than someone else, as the dialogue indicates. But we don't really get that emotional need. Thus when Phil drives off Mulholland, we're really just glad to be rid of him. I agree that the women are the most likeable. However, we fail to understand why they hang around these guys. Robin Wright Penn's Darlene seems too bright & together to connect with Eddie. As the waif Donna, Anna Paquin almost made me forget her Rogue character from the X-Men movies. She is so vulnerable that I felt sorry for her. As Bonnie, Meg Ryan takes the role that won Ivey the Tony, but we fail to understand why she is loose. She doesn't seem like a girl who'd have such low standards. The fact that she walks out on Eddie seems to confirm this. Screenwriter David Rabe had worked with Penn in two other films, "State of Grace" & "Casualties of War." While Penn comes off the best, the overall effect of the story is that these are successful people who live in the Hollywood hills, but who have no moral compass and are profoundly unhappy. It was a chore to make myself sit through the entire film. I could only do it late at night after my wife had gone to bed, because she wanted nothing to do with it after the first 10 minutes. So while this project may have been wonderful on Broadway, the film version nose-dived into oblivion. Taxi!
1	Not for everybody Being a real star isn't anybody's stuff... Whenever you catch something that's too heavy for you, you'll drop it. That's what a man like Mc Queen never did until he became a living icon to many people of all ages, and managed to live with it. A few money helps, but still... Being still able to act and to be funny when you know you may be going to die within the next weeks, is another proof of how mentally strong a man can be. Or maybe a bit "unconscious" too, as to perform what Mc Queen did in that film, assuming there was no FX in there... Having a funny line that reads "puffing's not my trick", when you only got one half lug left to breath with in the reality, also is a proof of a certain irresponsability, but that's why an actor like Mc Queen was what he used to be, and why the public still likes him so much. Thanks to mr Legrand for having properly wasted the original soundtrack of Steve Mc Queen's last performance to the screen, when Charles Bernstein's score serves the movie so well... Pick the French version if you want to check it out
1	Fresh Prince fans love it! I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas. He watched and re-watched this season. And I found myself working thru the discs too.
1	Feast of All Saints The first time I saw this movie was at a friends home. Had to find it because it was that great. History is explained so well. l looked in stores, but it was not available. I went to Amazon and to my surprise located it. Love the movie, the price, and the fast shipment. Would highly recommend this film to everyone
1	Genius in the Service of Evil I can't add to the discussions of the repulsive evil represented by this movie or its place in American film history. But I do have two suggestions. First, buy a longer version of the movie because these contain the complete version. Other versions are shorter because they either contain the much-edited version Griffith re-released in later years or are artificially speeded up to conform to modern frame rates. Second, read some background on the technical innovations of the film before watching it so that you can appreciate how this movie is THE seminal movie in American film history. You can find some good background material online. You will be amazed by Griffith's technical genius. But you will also feel you need a moral cleansing after watching his mocking, degrading, violent portrayal of black human beings and glorification of the KKK
1	Babylon 5 - The Complete Second Season This is the best SCI-FI series ever,with incredible SFX,a great cast,and a riveting story line.
1	Superb series I enjoyed Hawaii Five-O as a schoolboy decades ago on a black and white TV, and it is a real pleasure to see it in a crisp clear colour version on DVD. One thing that made this series so good (as I now see) was that, apart from being set in 'Paradise', as its worthy successor Magnum P.I. would be, there was no set formula for the stories; the variety is constantly surprising. The two-part story of how McGarrett deals with a person claiming to cure cancer by an electronic gadget is one I remember from childhood. The series (and DVD) have been so well made that it easy to forget that what we see on screen was filmed over three decades ago. I suppose 'Paradise' never ages or gets dull. I look forward to the whole series coming out on DVD, the sooner, the better! Highly recommended
1	I really loved it This was the first time that I've seen a Korean tv series. I must say that It was an enjoyable experience. Even though I didn't even see the show from the beginning I saw enough to want to own the series so that I may enjoy from beginning to end over and over. I love tv shows like this with a beginng middle and end. Whether English or Korean this is the type of television that families could enjoy together
0	Disappointed The cast is great! Not sure how they got the stars to do this movie The story line about an aging Robin Hood and Maid Marian as a nun just doesn't do well. Filming is below standard and dialogue is weak. Save your mone
1	Great movies These movies are great and a must have set for any Munsters fan!! Bought seperately these dvds cost $15 each so why not get this 2 movie set and save $$$! About the two movies: "Munster, go home" The laughs begin when Herman moves the family to an English estate he inherited. Run time 1 hr 37 mins. "The Munsters 'Revenge" Dr. Diablo concocts a plan to create robot "Munsters" to pull off a series of art heists. Run time 1 hr and 37 minutes. Recommended!
1	Ridley + Stone + Penn = serious rock 'n roll. U Turn (Oliver Stone, 1997) I'm a big fan of Stray Dogs, the John Ridley novel upon which U-Turn is based, and I avoided the film for while because, really, how many film adaptations of your best-loved novels actually work the way you want them to? I shouldn't have worried, though; U-Turn is the stuff, most decidedly. The plot: Bobby Cooper, an on-the-run tennis pro (Sean Penn) has his car conk out on him just shy of a very, very weird little desert town. One of its residents, Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez), immediately catches his eye, but he soon finds out she's married to a nasty old character named Jake (Nick Nolte), who'd just as soon see her dead-- and offers Bobby fifty grand to do the deed. Immediately, a complex web of deceit unfurls among all the characters, complicated by a number of even stranger events happening at just the wrong time to make Bobby's life miserable. The main thing that sticks out about this movie is the caliber of its cast, and the caliber of the performances they give. When you have to stick Jon Voight and Billy Bob Thornton seventh and eighth in credits order, you've got a high-powered cast working for you. All of them are spot on. The plot moves forward at almost blinding speed (just as it did in the book; Ridley adapted his own novel), and the viewer has very little time to do anything but clench his teeth and hang on for the ride until the final credits roll. It's just plain fun. I'm not sure why I stopped watching Oliver Stone flicks in the late eighties (okay, yeah I am-- Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors, and JFK back to back got a little heavy in to the world of way-out conspiracy theory for me), but I'm glad I've started again. *** ½
0	soundtrack ruined it Oh man, this movie was so hard for me to stay interested in. The story had potential to make a adequate drama/thriller, if only it had been directed right. A lot of times you hear people say, such and such movie "took itself way too seriously." Well in this case I don't think this movie took itself seriously enough. I felt detached from the movie the instant my ear drums vibrated as that RIDICULOUS soundtrack made way into my head. Every moment where it had the chance to build a little bit of tension, this goofy music would kick in, or a wacky Looney Tunes type sound effect would "boing," or do something similarly zany, totally leaving me uninterested. I don't understand why they would go for that type of comical atmosphere with a story like this. It's not like the story itself was clever enough to be able to pull off being told in such a manner. The tone of the movie and the tone of the soundtrack conflicted with each other, not a good thing. The one part of the soundtrack I did like was the hollow, ambient type of music they played in many of those desert scenes, that created a good mood I thought. A random point- Remember the scene where Jennifer Lopez almost got pushed off the cliff? Ask yourself, would a normal person react that calmly, or make such a quick witty comment about their situation, when their life hangs in the balance?
0	I will never watch this again.... As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it. I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this. What a waste!" Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes. The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story. Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic. I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.
1	Thank you Fox! Finally being released on DVD This movie is great fun! Betty Grable is absolutely stunning as is Carole Landis and very good suporting cast as well as great costumes, lovely sets and gorgeous technicolor make this musical a delight. I've practically worn out my tape and now at last it is being released on DVD as part of the Betty Grable collection. Now let's see more great Fox musicals of the forties released!! "Moon Over Miami" is a remake of an earlier (non musical) called "Three Blind Mice"1938 staring Loretta Young, Joel McCrea and David Niven. It is also enjoyable if you can find it.
0	Saccharine Unlike some of the other Little People DVDs (e.g., the "Friendship Collection"), this video is contrived and painful to watch. Even our toddler can tell that it's trying too hard to be educational
1	Journey to the Center of the Earth Milo Thatch is a young man obsessed with finding Atlantis. The obsession already destroyed his grandfather and is now about to end his career as well. In the early 1900's Milo gets a break when a wealthy friend of his grandfather settles a bet and agrees to fund an expedition to find Atlantis. Everything is ready to go what with subs, vehicles, crew, supplies and experts. All that is needed now is for Milo to bring his linguistic abilities in order to translate an ancient book that contains directions to the lost civilization. The expedition is quickly reduced to a mere handful of survivors and it is up to Milo to save them by leading them to Atlantis. Milo succeeds and Atlantis is found. Atlantis is alive by not thriving. Milo may be able to help the ancient civilization if he can get around some of their laws, prejudices and superstitions. But all is put in jeopardy when certain truths about motives are revealed and the fate of Atlantis may be sealed for good. Again it falls to Milo to rise above his bookish ways and find the hero within and save the day. As this is a Disney flick we know it will all work out in the end somehow. While I find the story entertaining I am puzzled by a few things like why the Vikings use English, how someone found a path on the ocean floor without a submarine, or how Altlanteans who are over 8,000 years old have forgotten their culture (this usually happens with successive generations and not in what amounts to childhood to twenty). But if you can get around that, the film is filled with colorful characters, beautiful sets, and some very good voice characterizations. Michael J. Fox as Milo was wonderful (and lets not forget James Garner's role). If you want some fun and adventure, this is a film that provides it. Check it out
1	Strikingly Beautiful Story and Film I hadn't heard anything about this movie when I bought it, but the cover caught my eye. I ended up with one of my favorite movies ever. This film is very much a coming of age film about a young boy going through rough times and dealing with the guilt of a tragic mistake. This film pulls at the heartstrings and appeals to the eyes. For lovers of art house films, this is a must have. Often times hazy, often times gritty, and always beautiful, this film will not disappoint.
1	Cool I really loved this! It inspired me to love the Nutcracker alot. I like the voices in it, especially Phyllis Diller's voice on the Mouse Queen. I really wish they could've released this on DVD. It's such a great movie
0	Jet's worse film of all time Jet lee was dorky in this film, and the cholos he was teaching were just as bad. This film was made in a desperate attempt to relaunch his career in America. After seeing the light, Jet returned to Hong Kong and completed the historical Once Upon a Time in China series. The rest is history
1	Great Robin Williams Performance Robin Williams was perfectly cast as Jakob Heim. The critics hated this movie, but I enjoyed it alot. This is one of my favorite Robin Williams films, next to Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society. This is a great Holocaust movie and you should buy it or at least rent it
1	calming This dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing. Her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange, takes some getting use to. It kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time I put it in! This is the dvd I like to use before I go to my yoga class for some reason. I guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up. She uses different poses than most other dvds which is nice for a change. A great one to have in your library. Beautiful scenery also
1	Yes, Yes, Yes! Finally an intelligent, well made adult (for grown ups, not soft porn) thriller. No juvenile excess, just excellent acting and writing. Talia Shire is one resourceful little woman. The Marines may be looking for a few good men but I'd go anywhere with a squad of Talias for backup. Jump back
0	Definitely not science fiction I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic "I'll be back" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1
0	Not what I expected from other reviews... I don't know alot about old movies, especially not silent film, or anything before the 40's, so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy. Most of the shots were very long, repetitive, and boring. It was rare for a scene to have much editing at all, it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that doesn't tell much of a story at all. The woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious. In my opinion, I'd rather read it myself than have it read to me. I don't like that voice there. As some of the other reviewers have said, some of the effects and costuming worked very well. Very impressive for the time. The direction, action, and pacing/storytelling just didn't seem to work well at all for me. Very slow. I fell asleep several times and had to rewind. If you want a good silent film, check out Steamboat Bill, Jr. Excellent
1	I LOVED IT!! The first story "The Spiderwoman" was very good. 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion. It was a good story line with some humor thrown in there. The second story "Crevices" was AMAZINGLY awesome. 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion. To me it was a genius story line. The only problem is that this story should have gotten some more showtime. It was the creepiest one on the DVD. Norio Tsuruta did I VERY good job. So...congrats to him :) The third story "The Sacrifice" had a good story line to it. 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion. I think they could have done something to make the hideous head a little more... scarier though. The fourth story "Blonde Kwaidan" was HORRIBLE! 1 out of 5 stars in my opinion. I'm sorry... but there was really no story line to it. It hardly explains anything... it was just a waste of film. The film used for this story should have been used to make "Crevices" a bit longer ;) The fifth and final story "Presentiment" was pretty good. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars in my opinion. It was kinda slow a bit, but it really did have a good story line to it. All and all this was a very good DVD. Glad I bought it. I have no regrets. (Except for watching "Blonde Kwaiden")
0	Japanese Goosebumps! This film is $7.50 at walmart! The Japanese Goosebumps! Twilight Zone wannabes! Yeah, it's good. Good to laugh at! The Sacrafice should have been packaged alone for $1.50; I would have been satisfied
0	STRANGE "MOVIE"..... A chemist (Brenda Marshall) working on a new anesthetic takes the product home and tries it out. Her assistant (Hilary Brooke), who may be after Marshalls' husband, arranges an "accident" that reults in Marshalls' face being disfigured. Marshall then murders a woman trying to blackmail her over a previous car accident and has to go on the lam with the dead womans' identity. She plots to take revenge and everything snowballs into a nightmare worse than before. The finale sees it all as just a weird hallucination she experienced from the drug. Huh? All this mumbo jumbo is played out in a very short running time. I wouldn't call this a "movie" so much as a cheap experimental student project. There are no production values at all. The sets are cardboard and the acting is dull and at times amateurish. I know that Anthony Mann has a reputation as a low budget film noirist but this is the cheapest attempt at telling a story I've seen in a while. Ulmer's "Detour" is pretty cheap but at least it's interesting. This was interesting at first but the ending just left me flat. Low budget is one thing but out and out cheap is another. I will not fault this films' defenders. To each his or her own. But it's just too cheap for me to see more than once. So it's recommended for Manns' fans and others with their curiosity meter turned WAY up
0	This is a sorry movie. This movie is not worth buying. It's horrific and full of graphic violence. Stallone shouldn't have made this movie. It stinks
1	The Hot Chick This is one of Rob Schneider's best movies. Schneider plays as a middle-aged "hobo" that switches bodies with a popular mean high-school girl. Rachel McAdams has to find the guy that is inside of her body so they can switch back before it is too late
0	I could only watch 20 minutes of it. I cannot believe that I paid so much for such a horrible movie. I thought I was buying the cream of the crop and I ended up with this. After 20 minutes I couldn't stand it anymore. I've never seen a movie so stilled. It seemed as though the scenery was all plastic. I rated it 1 star, if I could, I would not have given it a rating at all. The movie starring Daniel- Day Lewis was a much better version. Actually there isn't any comparision between the two
1	A great movie and start of a great career This is Guy Ritchie's first movie. Very few screenwriters and directors can say they their first endeavor was so successful. This is an amazing story that is clever, funny, and unpredictable. I wish I could write movies like this! A must see for any serious film fan
0	A Sad Waste of Talent Expect no sparkle from stars or script in this remake of the witty comedy classic, which has been repeatedly filmed with varying degrees of success since 1931. There is no chemistry between the male leads, and Burnette is unspeakably bad in her cameo appearance. Recommendation: see instead &quot;His Girl Friday,&quot; starring Rosalind Russel and Cary Grant; it is easily the finest screen version of the famous stage play
0	A big disappontment! the dvd is too short with music content. The songs are edited and even the Lenny White song is excluded from the dvd even though it is listed on the cover. I have been a Stanley Clarke fan since the RTF days and was waiting patiently for this release but I guess I would need to wait some more to see if there will ever be something release from Stanley that is better than this
0	HAS ENOUGH BLOOD TO GAG A VAMPIRE Brief plot summary: two low life hoods kidnap a pregnant surrogate mother. Her baby's "father" (sort of) turns out to be a mob boss (or has mob connections), said mob boss whistles up his goons, they go after the hoods, and then a lot of people die. If you like watching characters for whom you care nothing about get slaughtered in bloody gun fights, this film is for you. You don't have to worry about a plot or being required to use your brain, just sit back and watch the mayhem. Speaking for myself, the first 10 minutes of guttermouth verbal abuse directed at del Torro and his pal by the woman he ended up punching out was more than enough for me, but unfortunately, the friends I was with wanted to see the whole thing, and I had to sit through the whole thing to the very bloody end. So, in summary, Way of the Gun is just a Pulp Fiction wannabe put together by some Quentin Tarrantino wannabe and you could do a lot better for an evening's home viewing. If gritty violence is what you like, and feasable plots are optional, Narc with Jason Patrick (one of Hollywood's better stars and one of the least appreciated) and Ray Liotta is a far more masterful piece of film than the sophmoric Way of the Gun
0	X-Men We did not receive this item. We would rather not rate this item since it was never received... We consider it a zero star not even 1 star
0	what are the films? It would help if you'd list the films in this collection so I could tell if I wanted to buy it
0	HAS SOME DECENT ACTING, BUT... A REGGAE MUSICIAN BEGINS TO DEAL DRUGS FOR A DRUG KINGPIN SO HE COULD GET THE MONEY FOR STUDIO TIME. HAS A DECENT PLOT, BUT MOST OF THE ACTING ISN'T GOOD, AND MOST OF THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST CLICHED CHARCTERS THAT YOU'D USUALLY SEE A JAMAICAN ACTOR PLAY. I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF THINGS TO LAUGH AT WHEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE. NOT THE WORST OF ITS KIND, BUT, I DON'T THINK ITS REALLY WORTH BUYING
1	Titanic owes some of its success to THIS I love disaster movies, or any disaster movie that involves water - Titanic, Hard Rain, Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Titanic ... Yeah I love Titanic. But I was shocked when watching this film how much Titanic resembles it! There's a lot where you can see where James Cameron might have got some of his ideas from. I felt very claustrophobic watching this film, not only were we watching it in the darkness, but there were also fireworks going off outside, and the film itself is very claustrophobic. There's no natural light, as the boat is capsized. I had an awful time recognising actors in this, particularly Gene Hackman. I knew the name, I could NOT pick out which one he was. (Very blonde moment there.) I eventually recognised him, cos he was the main character (big clue there), and he was also using Simon Cowell's fashion sense - high waisted trousers, and polo neck TUCKED IN. I don't know why it took me so long to recognise him, but I managed to recognise Ernest Borgnine, who played Rogo, as being in Little House In The Prairie, in one or two episodes. The Poseidon Adventure is a really good film, with no need for special effects or CGI, apart from the odd one or two. Nearly all the stunts were performed by the actors themselves, when possible, and they would have ended up with many bumps. What made this film all the more better was the lack of special effects, and it made it all the more real. I was holding my breath during many scenes - which was quite difficult considering I was blocked up with the cold at the time - and because it was so claustrophobic, it made it all the more worse. The Poseidon Adventure is definitely up there as one of my favourite disaster movies now, and I really look forward to seeing the sequel, and the 'remake'. And I just discovered by looking at IMDB, that Red Buttons (what a strange name) was also in Little House On The Prairie, in two episodes
1	Pinocchio It is a good movie for young elementary students. It was very good
0	Fifth Is the Final Nail in the Series' Coffin ... So Bad (And Not the Kind of Bad You can Enjoy) "Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave" (2005) is, in short, not scary nor funny, another disaster in this series. I thought "Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis" (2005) was so awful, enough terrible to become the nail in the series' coffin, but I was wrong. They made another sequel which is worse than the previous "ROTLD." Considering the badness of `Necropolis,' this is kind of amazing. Actually "Necropolis" and "Rave to the Grave" (the fourth and fifth entries in `Return of the Living Dead' series) were shot back to back in Romania. Director for both films is Ellory Elkayem (`Eight Legged Freaks"), and `Rave to the Grave" features some of the stars of `Necropolis' including Peter Coyote, Aimee-Lynn Chadwick, Cory Hardrict and John Keefe. `Rave to the Grave' is about the high school students who survived the terrible zombie outbreak in the previous film. They are now college students and this time one of them finds a dusty canister in the attic, but instead of leaving it alone or reporting to the police, he and his friends take a sample of the slimy liquid inside and bring it to the laboratory in the campus. And ... here is the silliest part ... one student makes a drug called `Z' out of the sample and starts to sell it on campus. `Rave to the Grave" relies on this silly one-joke idea about the zombie drug that not only makes people act like zombies, but actually turns them into real ones. The film runs out of steam halfway through the story, and the rest of it is about the repetitious battles between zombies and humans that are neither thrilling nor funny to see. Two `Men-in-Black'-like hitmen are added to the humorless story of teenager zombie attack, but their downbeat humor does not work with the weak and pointless direction that fails to make the entire film a real gorefest or campy fun. The only good thing about the film is you can see Tarman Zombie, but only briefly. Except for one mildly amusing scene, he has nothing to do in the film. He appears and stays out of the film most of the time. This is definitely the worst film in the `Return of the Living Dead' series, and probably nearly as bad as the notorious "House of the Dead.
0	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY I AM A BIG FAN OF " AMERICAN ME " " BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT " ETC. BUT THIS ONE JUST TOTALLY SUCKED!!! IT HAS REALLY CHEESY SOUND EFFECTS AND THE STORY IS WELL NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH " SCARFACE " " GOODFELLAS" " GOD FATHER " TRAFFIC " CARLITOS WAY " BLOW " 21 GRAMS " TRAINING DAY " JUST TO SAME A FEW
1	If you love Livvy..... Ok, so this movie was a flop...story is kind of silly, but if you LOVE ONJ like I do, you will enjoy this! Livvy is beautiful as always in this movie and her music was great too! Yeah, I agree with the other reviews, it is a "Hall of Shamer" but, us die-hard ONJ fans still like watching her!
0	insulting There are GOOD B movies and wretched ones...this one is Wretched with a capital W...... Almost ANYTHING with Casper in it other than "Starship Troopers" is usually horrible...this film seemed OK I mean it has Rod Steiger and Kim Catrall in it!!! I figured it would be a B movie and be "fun" but in the end its just BAAAAAD....Its not witty like Lost Boys nor fun like "John Carpenter's Vampires".....The film tries too hard to be funny at times and shlocky when it comes off very amatuerish. Simply this is just a real waste of money and time..
1	this is the it ! buy this right now ! This is a great dvd,alot of xtra feature.I think of all make up effex this is the best + love the soundtrack !! Of all versions out their this is the one you should buy. Get City of the living Dead and The Beyond will your their, you wont be disapointed !! Lucie Fulci, we miss you
1	Queen of the Damned OMG! How can i begin to descibe the sexiness of LESTAT! (Stewart Townsend) He's like the hottest 500yr old ever! You don't have to love VAMPIRES to love this film. Lestat (Townsend) is a rebellious loner type vampire who is fed up with living in the shadows of eternity and wants to live out in the open of the 21st century. So he does what anyone who wants to be heard, known and worshiped would do... he becomes a rock star. It's there in his new found fame and fortune that he catches the eye of a young woman named Jesse. She becomes facinated with Lestat and the dark relm he lives in. Then theres the competition, Akasha,(R&B singer Aaliyah) the Queen of all who are damned. Aaliyah gives a grand performance as this "take no crap from any human or fanged fiend" mother of vampires everywhere. This movie is the latest in the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice. It is not set in the 1400's but it does give tales of the old and the new. It's a great flick pick for a Friday night with any kind of company, the living or the undead.
1	Enjoyable Backstager If you overlook the dreary Hedy Lamarr plot, there's a lot to savor in this picture: Garland's singing, of course, which includes an early and very funny bit of self-parody when she belts the "showstopper" version of "I'm Only Chasing Rainbows." Note the look on Garland's face when papa/vaudeville veteran Charles Winninger orders her to "Give it all you've got!" Judy seems about to say, "Well, you asked for it..." My only disappointment is that she is assigned the negligible tune "Minnie from Trinidad" as her 11 o'clock number. Lana Turner's performance as a gone-to-hell-in-a-handbasket showgirl/boozer. Campiest moment in the film is when JUDY is assigned to keep Lana sober! Lana's final promenade down the stairs (to yet one more reprise of "You Walked Out of a Dream") is worth the price of the DVD -- this is what star quality is all about. There are also some very funny bits from Edward Everett Horton and Eve Arden -- which made me wonder why La Arden didn't turn up among all the other ladies in THE WOMEN, lensing at Metro about the same time as this pic. Oh, and one other thing: do you notice that this film has almost the identical plot to VALLEY OF THE DOLLS -- with Lana in the Neely O'Hara part
0	Insulting for people of faith, in my opinion First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake. Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm. That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?" This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism
1	A diamond from the diamond I was a big fan of Major League, but was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and as a result didn't buy Major League III for more than a year. I'm sorry about that, because it turned out to be as good as or better than any in terms of its story and execution, and casting. In the first Major League, we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which held up well even though I thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much. In Major League II, which is still entertaining, I think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues. For instance, Wesley Snipes, the base stealing pheenom, was replaced by another actor, yet we are supposed to believe he's the same person. Doesn't quite work. Also, the love interest focus switched from Tom Berenger to Charlie Sheen, and we are supposed to know all about (and root for) a former girlfriend we have never seen before, and whose existence wasn't even hinted at in the first film. And finally, the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way (why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of Cleveland so bad in the first film?). Still the second film was enjoyable and worth having, even with these issues. So, I expected a lower budget, poorer result with Major League III, and boy, I was wrong. New characters and a new situations develop, and it all seems appropriate and fresh and the acting is top notch; the cast plays like a team and the script moves forward like a well-oiled machine. The music and photography are excellent and the action is in general spontaneous and very fun (like when the villan manager of the Twins hits himself in the head with a richocheting baseball). All the new characters carry off their roles extremely well, and all in all I think you should NOT skip this one if you like the series at all.
1	So clever and intelligent This is a clever film with an imaginative layering of stories, with a central historical thrust that is disturbing but important to hear about.
1	The Presidio DVD This is a fabulous movie. I have it on video and decided to replace the video with DVD. Sean Connery, Meg Ryan, and Mark Harmon are amoung my favorite actors and actresses, so to get a great movie with all three of them in it, is a real bonus. Dee Moffat Port Angeles, W
0	Continuing The Downward Spiral Of What Was Once A Good Franchise. Dean Winters, doing his best impression of Ben Affleck, stars in this, the sixth installment in the constantly withering "Hellraiser" franchise. In "Hellraiser: Hellseeker," his character, Trevor Gooden is married to good ol' Kirsty Cotton, who we remember from the first three films. Trouble is, she seemingly dies in a car wreck less than ten minutes into the movie and Trevor has one massive headache trying to figure out what happened. Let it be known that history does repeat itself. Just like "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth" and "Hellraiser: Bloodline," this one takes the series further into shame and embarassment. It's a direct-to-video sequel, but c'mon, we expect better than this. Maybe "Hellseeker" was a good script at some point, but when they decided to throw Pinhead and Kirsty into the mix, it got lost. See, these characters serve little to no purpose in the plot. They are just gimmicks, placed within a story to draw in viewers and feed off a legendary title. This is not a "Hellraiser" movie. A healthy chunk of it just adds up to a sub-standard psychological thriller, nothing else. In fact, Pinhead and Kirsty hardly come into play until the final 15 minutes, which feel like a remake of the original movie. I like to think I have an open mind when it comes to movies, and horror in particular. But this movie is a joke. The producers obviously masked an incomplete script to pass it off as a "Hellraiser" movie (ala "American Psycho 2") and shouldn't think for one second that we can't tell the difference. The end result is full of plot-holes, loose ends, inconsistencies, etc. etc. If you can make any sense out what you saw or if you can even call it a movie at the very end, you're a better person than me
1	You will LOVE it!!! The Art of Knitting and Crochet 2 was my first introduction to crocheting. It made learning to crochet really really easy. Everytihng is shot nice and close and Nancy Brown's demos are right on point. You'll make some fun stuff with this dvd...it's great if you love to knit and are always on the lookout for additional knitting projects and are interested in learning to how to crochet. I love this dvd and I know you will too!!
1	Wonderful Doris down on the farm Cute, warm & funny. Not the funniest sitcom ever, but who cares. Doris Day is something we'll never see again. A true original. She rocks
0	Lagrimas of boredom Boring, derivative and very mildly amusing. Almodovar did it all before-and much better 20 years ago! I couldn't ever watch it for more than 30 minutes. The only positive comment I have is that the movie shows a more polished and upscale side of Mexico and not the usual slums and sordid lives that seems to be so typical in Mexican movies, at least those imported in the USA.
0	This is why sequels have such a bad reputation The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So... No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right. Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time. So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again
0	Ambush Bay -- not art Ambush Bay is not art. It is not entertainment. It is not even interesting. Ambush Bay is without a doubt one of the worst WWII movies ever produced. The best part of this movie is Robert Mitchum's red cap, worn while he is in the Philippine jungle hiding from Japanese soldiers. Red cap.... Why not wear universal orange? I've seen the movie twice. Once with the sound on. It was awful. I watched it again, with the sound off. It was better this second time. It had the feel, without sound, of an ok comedy. With the sound it was pathetic. Don't both buying it. Spend your money on something more useful or entertaining.
1	I Luv this movie I loved this movie even as a child but i only rememeber bits and pieces of it and i couldn't remember the title and drove myself CRAZY trying to find it and finaly i did!!! i'm so happy
0	Terrible.Terrible movie, Avoid this one at all costs P.U.N.K.S. is a very bad movie even for a Disney channel movie. A boy is feeling neglected after his dad dosen't make it to his party and then finds his father is making a suit that is a robotic suit for a evil boss that walks with a crow on his shoulder. This is by far the WORST movie of the 1990s next to Titanic. This movie is only for kids and idiots because this movie is awful. Even Randy Quaid and Henry Winkler were embarrassed to be in this mess. If you want a good Disney channel movie watch The Paper Brigade. The only good part was the credits
0	Disappointing These Bean cartoons are to comedy what cardboard is to cookies. The humour found in identifying with the live Mr. Bean is lost in simple crude cartooning and wishy-washy colors. Not even the occasional grunt from Atkinson brings these boring drawings and predictable story-lines to life. Not watchable, even by great fans of Bean or by children
0	0 STARS: And this movie really, really, really deserves 0 stars!! "An American Werewolf in Paris" is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever observed. Don't even try to compare this to the classic "An American Werewolf in London". This movie is about as scary as "The Naked Gun", the acting is pathetic and the plot for this movie is horrible...I can not even bear to rehash it to you. There is nothing creepy or remotely scary about this movie...it is just plain stupid. Also, the werewolves in this movie look like some kind of a joke. I tried to keep an open mind, but basically, I could barely finish this movie and the best thing about it was when it was over and I did not have to watch anymore. Total waste of time. I mean basically, this movie is a total "ZERO" and my recommendation to you is not to even think of wasting your time on this flick.
1	Funny Movie "Meatballs" is Bill Murray's movie. He makes it work. From beginning to end he gives us a non-stop stream of funny lines and crazy antics. I believe we're seeing him (Murray) at his peak here. He's not funny at all these days, but back in the 70s he was the funniest person in the entertainment industry, and in "Meatballs" he is at the top of his game. I would pick Bill Murray (at his peak) over Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, or Robin Williams. The story ... your basic summer camp situation ... is brought to life and made hilarious. Bill leads the way, but he does get some help. The supporting cast is actually pretty good. They were well chosen for their respective roles, and are believable and likable. Chris Makepeace,the "short depressed kid we ordered" is very effective as the sensative camper who is shunned by the other campers. Jack Blum, as Spaz, is excellent. I think the creation of the Spaz character is a stroke of movie genius, and Jack makes the part work ... making me wonder if maybe he is that way in real life. Kristine DeBell is very nice as the counselor A.L. ... very likable. Bill Murray handles the funny guy role (who is actually a caring guy) with ease. His scenes with Chris Makepeace are very real, very touching ... and, whether he wanted to or not, Bill gave quite a bit of depth to the Tripper character. The humor does, at times, cross over the line into questionable taste. For some reason though, when Bill Murray makes a dirty joke, we are not offended. It's as if we know he's only bluffing and is not really that way. Personally, I think his clean material is better than that stuff, but if we want Bill Murray, I guess we have to take the whole package ... and we get a wide variety of humor here. But the movie is funny and entertaining ... beginning to end. And it holds up well under repeated viewing.
0	The cave in What a disaster. Don't waste your time with this one. Nothing grabs you in the beginning, the plot(if any) is poor, and yes there are some nice sets, but that doesn't make a good movie.
0	Worst movie ever...voice sounds like he has cancer! This was the worst Seagal movie ever made...It was confusing, dark, stupid plot and they made his voice sound like the Marlboro man with cancer. I used to love his movies but if this is the stuff he is now making he is all washed up. He fights like a old man in the movie too...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY...Too Bad...he used to be great
0	Baby Einstein DVDs Are Some of Worst Baby DVSs! I have bought 30+ baby/infant DVDS from different production companies, such as the "So Smart" series, the "Brainy Baby" series, the "Your Baby Can Read!" series, and the Nite Light ABC DVD. Baby Einstein DVDs are the lowest in quality, cheap toy props, boring music, nothing stimulating. I would recommend the So Smart DVDs and the Brainy Baby DVDs. Your Baby Can Read! are OK, not very high tech, but it could work.
1	HOOYAH! THIS IS THE MOTHER LODE Freddie Francis, Terence Fisher, Phil Leaky and all the crew! What more could you possibly want? Are you a Hammer Fan? Get this video, buy the popcorn, and enjoy yourself to the max! It's a technicolor orgy, and a fiendish festival. You will thank yourself for purchasing this collection many times over
0	Oh So Sincere, Oh So Bad! Stanley Kramer was a competent filmmaker who had a progressive, liberal point of view, often way before it was fashionable, on almost all social issues. It's hard to look at some of his films today without groaning, but they are all well meaning, if often way past gooey. Except for "Judgement At Nuremberg" and maybe "Inherit the Wind", all of them seem badly dated. The worst of the lot, "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" is almost unwatchable. The screenplay by Leonard Rose (which,unbelivably, won an Academy Award!)seems out of step even for the 60's. The plot is ludicrous and patronizing;the biracial couple is so perfect one would think they landed from another planet. Did Mr. Poitier HAVE to be a doctor? Why not president? There is never the slightest doubt as to what is going to happen next in this film. All of the characters are stock, the storyline totally predictable and banal. For those suffering from A.D.D., poor Spencer Tracy gives a nice, long, sweet speech at the end which summarizes, verbatim, everything you've just had to suffer through the past hour and a half. The acting, except for Beah Richards, is uniformly bad (though with this story no one,not even Mr. Tracy, has a chance to do anything other than be cute).Ms. Houghten was pretty but talently challenged.Ms. Hepburn is especially dreadful in what is actually a rather small part. This was the start of the teary eyes,quivering chin (I am NOT referring to her neurological disorder!), "Oh,I KNOW you all love me!" phase of her career. Her eyes are very slanty in this film and one can see the scars of a recent face lift when she is seen in profile. Her close ups are all sort of hazy; kind of like Lucille Ball in "Mame". Ms. Hepburn always seemed strong and proud and unbeatable when she was younger, or at least until, "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner". Athough always somewhat actressy and prone to posing, she was always smart and likable and sometimes very effective, especially in comedies. I don't know why she chose to go down the saccharine path as she got older. It's very sad that Mr. Tracy (the most spendid and natural screen actor of his time) had to end his distinguished career in this embarrassing pile of glop. I immediately watched "Woman of the Year" and "Adam's Rib" after viewing "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" so I would remember how wonderful almost all of the other Tracy/Hepburn movies were.
1	Blues Deluxe What's not to like about LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE? You can scarcely argue with its roster of talent. It features Odetta, Ruth Brown, B.B. King, Solomon Burke, Shamekia Copeland, Dr. John, , Buddy Guy, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Honeyboy Edwards, Shamekia Copeland, Mavis Staples, Robert Cray, Keb Mo, Bonnie Raitt...the list goes on. Natalie Cole was bluesier than I ever would have imagined. As were Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. I'd seen David Johansen in his blues incarnation, so I wasn't surprised by his transition from New York Doll to Buster Poindexter to bluesman. Also very good were some folks I'd heard of, but had never heard: India.Arie, Angelique Kidjo. I wasn't as impressed by rapper Chuck D. although his anti-war version of "Boom Boom" certainly had its heart in the right place. John Fogerty's version of "Midnight Special," which he had recorded with CCR, didn't really bring anything new to the song, but it was pretty good. Macy Gray, doing "Hound Dog," was better than I'd expected too. I've found her voice a little irritating on some of the songs I've heard of hers, but it's hard to go wrong with a straight ahead tune like "Hound Dog." See it with someone you love. Or alone....but if you care about the blues as an art form, do see it
0	nasty nasty First off she is in a gay bar if my eyes weren't decieving me. Thats where she met the man to watch her when she was unwatchable. If you like nasty crap to watch i recommend this for you. I don't want to give away any of the movie sceens and ruin your experience, but i will say this much she starts her period, and he gets a taste.....this is in french, but it does have english subtitles. I am referring to the DVD.
1	The Best of Many Victor Hugo's novel has been filmed so many times, with excellent actors donning the hump: Lon Chaney, Anthony Quinn, and Anthony Hopkins are a few examples that spring to mind. However, the crude 'animalistic' behaviour and the pathos that Charles Laughton brings to his performance is wonderful, for at no time can the audience feel any sentiment for this Quasimodo. He is a horror with a human soul. While Cedric Hardwicke is a horror that pretends to have a soul. It is very easy to enthuse and celebrate the film, simply because it is wonderful to watch for its sets and, therefore, its art direction, photography, and design. The reason it was not heaped with Oscars is simple: it is one of the 'Great Films' of 1939. Let us go back to the actors. Cedric Hardwicke has never been as smooth a villain, he is as Frollo is evil. Maureen O'Hara in her first film may not be the ideal for a gypsy maid, but she does show what would become her strengths: independence from, and yet a dependence for men... Edmond O'Brien as Pierre shows his great talent (probably one of the best screen actors ever, he played a different person in each role, you could not type cast him). Thomas Mitchell as The King of Thieves is smart and in this film extremely dangerous. Another thing that the production did with understated talent was show a Europe moving from Medieval to Renassiance existence. If there is a fault with this film: it is simple. It has a happy ending.
1	What the Italian family is all about (My copy is a Region 2, European version). A masterpiece by Italian director Lucino Visconti. Intense, emotional, realistic, passionate, dramatic story of an Italian family from the poor south (Lucania) who immigrates to the northern city of Napoli. A 3-hour film that, alternatively, focuses on each one of the sons of the 'mamma'. If "Il Gattopardo" was the drama of the aristocratic Italian family from the south, this one corresponds to the poor family also from the south. Both are cinematic gems, worthy of being included among the best in film history. Although a long film, its intensity never diminishes. Every shot is full of emotion and meaningful and beautiful. The only thing that disappointed me a little was the way it ended, the last half-hour. It's more of an open ending, no conclusion. One of the most gorgeous films in b/w that I've seen. Italy to the bones.
0	this movie is trash this movie was soooo boring and not only that put even the ending didn't put means to the movie what a waste of seeing hte movie or even renting it trash
1	best buy My daughter is three months old and has been discovering/watching these DVD's since she was two weeks old. I didn't think she would pay any attention to them but she loves them! She sit's in her bouncy seat and we watch them together. She coos and smiles at all of the animals and kicks her feet to the music. Well worth the money!!!!!!!!
0	A post-modern revision of Scooby-Doo... I just had the chance to watch this film, and I was pretty sickened by the approach the writers took to this material. Apparently, someone felt that the classic "mystery" approach which the Scooby-Doo franchise had leaned on for the past several decades had grown stale, and so the writers and producers decided to throw away the formula which had made Scooby-Doo so popular, and re-cast this storyline into a cliche-ridden horror film more akin to "Night of the Living Dead". The writers go out of their way to mock the previous incarnations of the cartoon, pointing out time and again how all of the "monsters" which the Scooby-gang had encountered in the past had been men in monster suits. On this outing, the monsters they meet have no tricks. They are REAL. Real zombies, real ghosts, real voodoo priestesses. Along with all this so-called 'realism' are disturbing situations and terror, including graphic depictions of beheadings, torsos being ripped apart, and a scene where a group of peaceful farmers are herded into a crocodile-infested swamp by a bloodthirsty band of pirates, where they are eaten. It's not shown, but the quick cut away leaves little to the imagination with all the off-screen screaming. In short, this is a serious mis-step in the Scooby-Doo mythos, with the Scooby-gang at first cocky and assured that there are hidden wires or holographic projectors creating the monsters, only to grow more terrified and helpless as it's revealed that the horrors are not created, but actual. The writer's attempt to inject some educational value into the proceedings seems to be limited to indentifying the vast amounts of regional food that Scooby and Shaggy are constantly gorging themselves on. The insinuation that monsters like this are real is subversive and not appropriate for the age group that these cartoons are aimed at. Not recommended, unless you're an older viewer who's curious about the whole "what if" factor involved. The animation and other factors are all good, for this kind of direct-to-video product, and there are some brief moments of winking humor that long-time fans will quickly pick up on
0	Silly and Cheap Dino-Flick from the Director of 'Commando' Somewhere in Turkey, there is a forest where you may be attacked by man-eating flying monsters living in the dormant volcano nearby. To this place come one American professor who needs to publish a paper, one graduate student as assistant (and love interest), and four naïve undergraduates who just want to get their degree from college. Deep in this forest, moreover, a group of terrorists are hiding, and the US special force is sent to capture their leader in order to bring back him alive. (But do American college students need to fly all the way to Turkey to graduate? Travel financed by one of the rich student's daddy?) Part of this impossible scenario sounds like that of `Predator,' but in this film it is the titular dinosaur `Pterodactyl' - no, in fact, pterodactyls, to be precise - that attack the hapless special unit. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger classic, however, the creatures in `Pterodactyl' only bore you to death because of their cheesy CGI and dull and uninspired action scenes that always begin when there is nothing to talk about in the story. The film is not scary, nor exciting even with occasional gore, and when the flying pterodactyls look like big bats that you might see on video games, what can you expect from the rest of the film's 90 minutes? Coolio is the captain of the special unit, and his acting itself is not bad. But at the same time, I am afraid, not many people would find the idea of Coolio vs. predacious monsters intriguing, and the results are exactly what you expect from the ill-judged combination. The other actors are not great either, but with this bad story and dialogues, and most of all very unconvincing creatures, none one can be blamed. The saddest thing is that the director is Mark L. Lester, who once did the underrated action film `Commando' back in 1985 with Schwarzenegger. That was a ridiculous story, but I really liked the way Schwarzenegger's hero talked and behaved (throwing a telephone booth!). It was silly, but it was fun. `Pterodactyl' is silly, and tries to be fun, which you know it is not
1	A Compelling Performance Having been a fan of Rigoletto for many years, I ordered this DVD based mostly on Placido Domingo's participation. Having watched it now, I have found it to be a rewarding performance. Domingo's Duke is very gratifying. Macneil's Rigoletto is vocally weaker, but his stage presence is powerful. On the whole his performance is effective as Rigoletto. I'm glad to have the DVD and expect to enjoy it many times
0	2 1/2 stars ! this is not the worst gore film eva made but not as good as expected! Lamberto Bava's "Demons 2" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! "Demons 2" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original "Demons" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!)
1	"I ain't afraid of no ghosts" Ivan Reitman's 1984 mega-hit, and it's lesser sequel, are both included in this double feature DVD gift set that long time fans of the Ghostbusters should consider an absolute must own. Chances are you already know the story: three bumbling scientists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis) lose their campus jobs and go into business for themselves. Only thing is, their business involves capturing and containing gross and slimy ghosts throughout New York. Also featuring Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, and Rick Moranis; Ghostbusters ended up being a super hit which spawned an animated series, tons of toys, and a sequel five years later. Ghostbusters 2, while nowhere near as wonderful as the first film but still pretty fun, finds the guys back in business as a new breed of evil is about to be birthed in time for New Years. Although this isn't the first time both films have appeared on DVD, there's enough special features here to make this Gift Set worth picking up. There's a nice selection of deleted scenes (nothing substancial), a couple featurettes, and commentary from Reitman and co., but there's no features devoted to Ghostbusters 2. Instead, there are two animated episodes that are linked to the two films, and there's an exclusive scrap book included too with a nice variety of information for fans. If you've already been double dipped by the Ghostbusters on DVD, picking this up is entirely up to you. However, if you're a fan of these films and don't own them on DVD, pick this affordable Gift Set up and enjoy
0	Not for DVD aficionados I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD. Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade. This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now
1	It made me hot too! That Jason Jordan has it exactly right. This is a homo-epic of astounding proportions, as indeed were one or two of the delicious young men in the movie. I'd give this thousands of stars if I could, because that's all I can see after playing along with this DVD for 10 minutes or so..
1	*Re-living Back In The Days* The movie was awesome. It had a great story line. Also it takes you back to the late 70's and the early 80's. Spike Lee definitly did a good job with the clothing, the scenary, and the music. It is a great family movie
0	JohnyGluebag ****this review is NOT for the superbit version***** The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do. Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on? It would help out
1	A stunning masterpiece of a movie I'm going to keep it short and sweet: A complex plot that's easy to follow. Beautiful locations. Crisp screenwriting. Crack acting. Sexy. Intellectual. Warm. You get the feeling that the actors and crew were transformed by the act of working on this movie
0	Vulgar and Offensive Before I begin the review, I should take time to mention that I am a huge baseball fan. I rarely miss a game, follow it as if my life depends on it, and see more baseball games at the ballyard every year than I do movies. I also played when I was younger and have worked on baseball-related projects for my alma mater. I had heard that Bull Durham was one of the best, if not the best, baseball movies ever made. As a fan of Field of Dreams and The Natural, I decided to go and rent this one. Figuring that it was about baseball I thought I couldn't go wrong, so I didn't check the ratings on any of the sites as I normally do for a movie. Big mistake on my part there. I couldn't even make it through a half hour of this movie. There was a little bit of baseball but nothing else worth mentioning. The entire thing was about sex, and I had to look away from the TV for some time. I was hoping it would get better but it never did, and after all the sex and foul language I stopped the movie, never bothering to finish it. I was surprised that so many people gave this vulgar excuse for a baseball film such high ratings. Looking at the summaries of the ending of the movie, it looks as if there is some baseball action later on but the female characters, who I did not like at all, seemed to persist. Unfortunately this movie is filled with sex, and I feel that it was far too inappropriate for any release. I'm not some kid writing this, I am a mature conservative Christian. This movie should offend anyone who believes in Him. Don't believe the hype from some of the sportswriters about this one. Go and watch a real baseball game--always a much safer bet for good clean family entertainment, plus it's very unpredictable and you never know what the results will be
1	A Treasure Returned to the Catalogue To the best of my knowledge, this is the first DVD featuring Renata Scotto although I would be delighted to be proved wrong (please reissue a Tokyo Lucia with Bergonzi). The only other DVD (with June Anderson)is hardly in the same league so perhaps I should have rated it five stars! My only negative is the very dated production; it clearly shows its age, especially aesthetically although I would be hard put to suggest how it should be staged. Suffice it to say that it works and with Scotto and Domingo the emphasis is clearly on the singing and they deliver in spades. It is ironic that Verdi didn't give his title soprano an aria that had been excerpted and sung by sopranos of the past whereas the tenor has the glorious aria that has be recorded countless times in the days of 78's and LP recitals. Needless to say Domingo garners the greatest ovation. Milnes was clearly an audience favorite (if not one of mine)and there is no doubting his committment to the role both in his aria and the wonderful duets with Scotto. It is somewhat ironic that Milnes and Domingo are roughly contemporaries while Domingo continues to sing (albeit a reduced and different repertory)and Milnes career started to fade a number of years ago. Ordinarily baritones can enjoy longer careers than tenors, but in this case..... Scotto is a treasure; the DVD should be required viewing and studying for any one who aspires to the repertoire. It was late in her career yet she is savvy enough to know how to capitalize on her strengths and minimize the weaknesses. Her attention to text is an object lesson and of course it helps that she is Italian, but she animates every phrase she sings, does nothing that is superfluous. I saw her only once, a Butterfly in San Francisco in the 70's; it was a glorious performance. But then she is a glorious artist
1	Classic I felt sorry for that poor man in the wheel chair, when he did all that for something he wasn't involved in..
0	Yow! This is the film that could easily have tanked the career of lesser mortals, but the mighty Jane Fonda continued acting in six or seven subsequent films until 1992, when she married Ted Turner and her film career ended rather abruptly. Kris Kristofferson is simply awful/laugable in his role as a Wall Street Troubleshooter. Don't look for this mess to be released on dvd anytime soon, unless it becomes a camp favorite. This film tries to be a potboiler, but it ends up being a soap opera with the world economy as a backdrop. It's one establishing shot after another, and the actual consequences of any actual conflict are too abstract for anyone to care about. Fonda and Kristofferson must have been embarrassed at this thing. It's just a sheer waste of two good actors. The plotline is so paper thin that even a kid in second grade would find it to be implausible. In fact, here's a script for a story that I wrote in about three minutes, which would have made more sense: "Heroes of the Stratosphere" by Thomas Redmond After taxiing down an airport runway near San Clemente, California, Jane Fonda and Kris Kristofferson take off in a badly-maintained twin engine biplane with Jane Fonda piloting. At 6,000 feet, Jane decides to put the plane through its paces, and begins performing aerial stunts like barrel rolls and steep power dives. Unfortunately, the airplane is not in very good shape and after about ten minutes, part of the left wing flies off. "Hey!," yells Kristofferson. "Hey, Yourself!," yells Fonda, coyly. "Yow!," replies Kristofferson. At that point, Fonda manuevers the biplane into a tailspin, and Kristofferson flies out of his seat, into the air and begins to fall to earth without a parachute. Then, in an attempt to save Kristofferson by scooping him into the navigator's seat, Fonda puts the plane into a steep dive but is unable to rescue the hapless Kris because of the damaged left wing. Fonda ends up crashing the airplane into a Lake near the DuPont estate near Wilmington, Delaware about a half an hour after takeoff. Somehow, both Kris and Jane emerge from the experience unscathed. Later on the two are reunited and they get married and live happily ever after. The End
0	Insulting for people of faith, in my opinion First, I did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original. I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake. Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm. That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our "hero" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, "Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?" This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion. The movie, it seems, coming down heavily on the side of secularism
0	TALE OF THE DANCING NOSE-HAIRS "Camelot" on Broadway was cursed with the most excrutiatingly boring book that droned on and on and on. But the production was blessed with a stellar cast including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet and an excellent score which included "If Ever I Would Leave You" powerfully sung by Mr. Goulet. Joshua Logan was tapped to direct the film version and of all the reasons why the film failed-Logan as the director was the biggest. Richard Harris as King Arthur when he wasn't hamming it up acted so morose you would think someone told him all the pubs in England had run dry. Vanessa Redgrave made an enchanting Guinevere but her demeanor was somewhat on the frosty side. Although the film boasted scenes of castles, vast meadows and grand castle ceremonial halls, Joshua Logan filmed a lot of the movie using extreme close-ups of his actors. And a tight close-up on Richard Harris' face on the giant cinemascope screen was especially distracting. When he sang his nose-hair could be seen swaying to the music. And on one of Vanessa Redgraves close-ups, it was obvious she had a cold, and a joker in the movie audience shouted, "Arthur get thy wife a hankie,
1	just the way i like my bond... Look people..its a Bond movie..movie loaded with 2 hours of action,explosions, cgi and hot women,this movie will give your sound system a workout, yeah some action scenes leave you doubting the realism but its BOND, get over it..GOLDENEYE still my favorit
0	Should have been left in the Sahara Well, this won't take very long. Warning! Spoiler here! Leading characters find themselves in a deadly, hopeless situation. Characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly, hopeless situation. One character makes a stupid joke, gives the others the high five and then Magic Carpet Ride starts playing. Repeat 10 times, and there you have Sahara. Wacky fun...if you play Little League and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake. Really, I usually put a lot of time in my reviews, but this one doesn't even deserve that. Dumbest movie I've seen in quite some time.
1	one of jackie's best This is a really enjoyable film. The action is great, the comic timing perfect, the stunts amazing. I'm stumped by how Hollywood can decide to release Twin Dragons when there are such great Jackie classics as Project A 1 and 2, Drunken Master 1 and 2, Police Story 1 and 2
1	really good movie It's a really good movie. I'm from Japan so I felt same things in the US several months ago. So, I can understand it. maybe, if you have never been to other countries, it's hard to understand this movie. overall, this is a really good movie
0	This thing is junk but my kid loves it My 33 month old loves it - it's junk, the production quality is weak, and the "story" is lame but my kid loves it. I think it was a great value given how many times he's watched it
0	Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so

0	BUYER BEWARE I GIVE A 1 STAR TO THE DVD'S NOT THE MOVIES. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW COLLECTOR'S BOX SET COMING OUT SOON. READ BELOW. Yes... looks like it's true. We've known for a while now that Warner Home Video was working on new DVD special editions of the Superman films to tie in with the release of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns later this year (in theaters 6/30), but now we have the first actual confirmation... from Ilya Salkind, who co-produced the first three Superman films! Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial). Thanks to Bits reader Matt K. for the heads-up on this.
0	Dissappointingly shrill The Edith Wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written, sensitive and poetic. While this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story, the performances of Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were painful to watch. Ms. Anderson especially, while a great beauty, so overdid her lines that I was reminded of high-school plays that I've seen. For emotion or drama, she spoke moreloudly. Her lines were raced through, and punctuated by strange words being stressed. And while she was trying to be distraught, or betrayed, or vulnerable, her face showed no emotion at all. A little bit of eye-brow raised, or pouting lips, but that was all. Eric Stoltz was little better. I couldn't help feel that Ms. Anderson was out of her depth as an actress. Bur Mr. Stoltz, who I've seen in many good roles, was inexplicable. Maybe it was the directing that failed them. This was so disappointing to me, as I had really wanted to enjoy it, and I had so enjoyed "The Age of Innocence," with Winona Ryder, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daniel Day-Lewis. But this production, from a superior book, really fell short. I would recommend the PBS version, with Geraldine Chaplin, if it were in any way available
1	Superior Concert Video This is by far the best concert video I own. The Stones were on top of their game at this St. Louis concert, soulful, bluesy, and rocking. The cameras stay on the band the whole time, unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience. The sound is CD quality, the picture and color is vivid, the editing is tight. The highlight for me is Keith Richards' "I Wanna Hold You" and some incredible versions of many classics. The songs from the Bridges to Babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire. The fact of the matter is the Stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts. I highly recommend this DVD. It is superior to the Four Flicks, and a lot less expensive. Five Stars
1	Preplay-review revised I haven't played this game yet, but from everything that I've seen I want to. I am writing this in reply to one of the others writing a review, and to let someone who wants this and decides not to get it because of their review. He said is was short and had a weird ending. Thats because it's not the ending. If you notice it's call Sin Episodes. There are going to be about seven of them. What's great is that, if you get injured, it will carry over to the next one. If you haven't deleted you save games.
0	Waste of a talented cast What a disappointment. Every single character in this film is depressed, mentally ill, and self-absorbed. No one is sane or sympathetic. Therefore, there's no one to identify with or root for. No one gets better or grows as a person. So what's the point? Annette Benning gives a strong performance, but her character is vapid and self-pitying. Not worth two hours of your life
1	Clint is the man in Joe Kidd This is one of my favorite Eastwood movies and what Clint said is the perfect western. In typical stoic fashion Eastwood outsmarts, outshoots and out-cools the badguys at every turn. I put this one somewhere just below The Good the bad and the ugly, but higher than Eastwoods recent work like Unforgiven where he seems to have lost his moral compass and confidence
0	The Four Feather Bore Sorry but if this movie gets better with time I wouldn't know. I was too impatient and bored to wait. If a movie doesn't capture me in the first 5-10 minutes I'm finished. This could be a five star movie for someone who has some patience and willing to invest the time
1	Satire on the Revival Business This film shows a 1920 speakeasy. Elmer Gantry is feeling no pain, and walks around to collect money on Christmas Eve for the Salvation Army. His sleaziness and dishonesty are quite apparent. After hopping a freight train, he jumps off to avoid being robbed. He seems to live without working, just going from town to town. [A crooked gambler or a confidence man?] Next he shows up at a revival meeting, where a young woman preaches and passes buckets for donations. [Is this entertainment before radio and movies?] Elmer's attempt to meet Sister Sharon Falconer is rebuffed; she knows the type. Can a salesman switch to a new line of products? [Many say it's the personality not the product.] Elmer's speech is quite popular with the audience. But what makes him give up smoking and drinking? Or inspire his speeches? There is another scene where a member of the audience begins to bark! Revivals grew out of the rural frontier, where people gathered like at a social event. A revival in Zenith can bring in church members, converts, donations, and publicity. But the revival company needs a guarantee to cover their fixed costs. [No one thinks of cutting costs.] George Babbitt explains why they must fill the churches - so people won't be tempted by other diversions (like politics). Sister Sharon's speech moves the crowd. It's a successful social event. The film shows how the press can turn public opinion against the revival meeting. [No mention of their hidden agenda.] There is an interesting philosophical conversation in the editor's office. Elmer shows his dialectical skills; he learned rhetoric at his seminary school. God's will brought Sister Sharon to Zenith, she will be able to build her tabernacle. There is a large amount of Populism in his speech; he attacked powerful corporations. [Rural farmers were hit by the Depression in 1921.] Elmer's call for popular revolt seems quite radical. He leads an attack on a speakeasy, then a brothel. Local gambling dens are overlooked. Elmer's past catches up with him: a blonde in a hotel room. This is a trap to photograph him in the act, a trick often used against reformers. They ask for a huge amount in blackmail, and for Sharon to deliver the cash. The publication of the photos are a front page scandal. Attendance drops off. Some rowdies show up to create a disturbance. [Did shutting down local vice hurt the wallets of the local ruling class?] A man who went deaf suddenly appears. After Sister Sharon lays her hands on him and calls for his healing. It works! [No ringer here.] But a discarded cigarette causes a fire and a panic. Is this the work of a devil? No fire regulations? Sister Sharon leaves for a better world. [I don't know if this film is true to the book. It is a good story, but the ending seems weak.] Why did people in rural areas turn to revivalism? 1921 saw the beginning of the Great Depression for them. Other organizations like the Populists or the Socialists were suppressed, their leaders jailed. Religion was the only way they could assemble together without being stopped. That is why the corporations were against them.
1	The movie that started the modern American mafia genera The Godfather set the American Mafia movie genera. A good plot line with a tight scrip, superb direction and well acted. There are many murders, after all this is about gangsters but why it's rated "R" is beyond me. It's way less gruesome with less disturbing violence than Casino and many modern MA films are much more violent. The power plays, honour and business scheming between the Mafia families give the framework of the film with personal trial and tribulations providing more depth for the character development that echo throughout the genera ever since and make The Godfather repeatedly watchable. I wanted a copy for a present and after spending months looking for a copy in the retail shops without success, I found this widescreen version at a great price on Amazon within seconds and, I ended up keeping it.
1	A Night Out With The Backstreet Boys Well I have the VHS edition and I say this concert is great. The only thing is I'm more of a funk man and I prefer Homecoming Live in Orlando
1	another escape piece This movie is cute and intelligently presented. It is an old film, yet an escape for some young people who are overwhelmed with so much talk about war in the world. Broderick does an excellent job of portraying a typical teenager, wanting to play and try different computer games, coming across something larger than life.
0	Disappointing... A beautifully shot movie plagued by a terrible script and bad acting. Russell Crowe shouldn't try the Hugh Grant shtick! The movie had all kinds of potential as a story but it falls back into Hollywood's story template mire. Hollywood won't take any chances, it has a few plot lines that it uses over and over. Hollywood believes that audiences are too stupid to think for themselves so they put out movies with few surprises, are totally predictable and feature characters that you have seen before. You know how this story is going to unfold within the first 15 minutes. The only reason to watch this movie was for the cinematography and Albert Finney's performance. He commands your attention, fills the screen with his acting. A superb performance. Many have said it is the new "French Kiss". Though the story lines are similar, the direction and character development in "French Kiss" was much better. Kevin Kline's acting and character development were excellent. If you want to see this genre done really well, watch the film "Mostly Martha" directed and written by Sandra Nettelbeck. No, it's not about Martha Stewart. "A Good Year" would have been a much better film in her hands
1	It Was a Great Time I thought the 2005 World Series Collector's Edition was really terrific. I enjoyed every second of it. It really caught all the emotion and suspense of four great ball games. This is one I will be watching over and over again. Anyone who is a fan of baseball and particularly a fan of the Chicago White Sox will want to have this collector's edition. The 2005 World Series was a great one
1	How could you not like this film? When a film is a horror/epic/monster/romance/martial arts/period film...what is not to like? if genre-bending films upset you then you won't like it. This movie is for everyone with an open mind. "Brotherhood of the Wolf" takes you places, and it's directed and acted very well. Great action, acting, and special effects. I like to keep my reviews on the shorter side, and this one is no different...check it out it is worth the money.
0	I can barely hear Chuck I have to contradict the other review. I thought it was shot fine, but the sound was not good. Moe is a two guitar band and I believe the strength of the band is the way the two guitar players play off each other. On the DVD, Al is real loud, but Chuck's guitar is almost completely inaudible. This is a real big disappointment to me. I really like moe, but I would not recomend this DVD except for those who have to have it. It's a real shame
1	Dreams and Magical Realities Sharkboy and Lavagirl is like a painting without 3D glasses. Put on the glasses and you experience a magical reality where dreams change your world and where the challenge is to overcome the nightmares. This movie is as much about facing fears and positive thinking as it is about special effects. It is especially impressive in this regard, with witty dialogue and spontaneous and unexpected turns of event. I found Lavagirl to be a beautiful character with a loving heart and playful outlook on life. She sometimes forgets her powers and they use this for comic effect. She seems a little lost at first, as if seeking her greater purpose all while enjoying a playful combative interchange with Sharkboy. The scenes take place in a school and in a magical dream reality. The characters move from real life to dreams in an instant and you can fall asleep and dream up a new reality in your dreams. It is all very fun and I found myself laughing throughout at the innocent humor and creative surprises. I think adults will get the "brainstorm" joke even more than children would and there is plenty of humor for adults and kids to enjoy. I also thought there were some amazingly profound moments during the conversations and if you realize what it would take to say those lines to someone who is a bully, that in itself should impress. On the fun visual side, lands of cookies and milk present culinary adventures as Lavagirl, Sharkboy and Daydreamer Max float through a world on a huge chocolate chip cookie. Then you have a volcano and worlds of imagination reminiscent of a theme park ride. There is a mildy dark nemesis who is the bully and he aggravates the situation by appearing in Max's dreams. He steals Max's diary. I loved that Max had a dream journal and how reading through the journal/diary made his dreams come true. Changing the dreams, changed the settings and this presents the challenge. The amazing thing about this movie is how it was inspired by a child's imagination and when you watch the extras, I think you will be even more impressed. I would love to see more movies like this because it reminds me of the hope we have as children and how we can still dream our worlds into life as adults. I think this movie gives children an empowering message and to be honest, some of the issues discussed in this movie could change a child's world for the better. Max is a great role model and his actions speak of a wisdom far beyond his years. As Max learns to navigate his own imagination, he is really teaching children amazing lessons about how to navigate life. Highly Recommended along with the 3D glasses! ~The Rebecca Review
1	Fantasy for Children My grandsons and I sat down to watch it and they were meznerized the entire time. Fantasy, learning, fun.
1	Solid Stewart western The collaboration of director Anthony Mann and the righteous Jimmy Stewart again provided the ingredients for a successful movie. Filmed against the sprawling picturesque terrain of New Mexico, the movie tells the tale of Will Lockhart, a loner and ex-Army man who is now delivering freight via wagon train. He winds up in the town of Coronado on the border of Apache territory, in part looking for the party responsible for the death of his younger brother. He was killed in an Apache massacre with rifles illegally supplied to them by an unknown arms dealer. The town is under control of Alec Waggoman, a cattle baron played by Donald Crisp. Stewart soon runs afoul of Crisp's ill tempered son Dave played by Alex Nichol coming into conflict with the family who own the huge Barb ranch. Ranch foreman and filial figure to Crisp, Arthur Kennedy playing Vic Hansbro, is also the guardian of Nichol, keeping him out of harms way. Stewart manages to upset the Waggoman family dynamic as he pursues the answers to his brothers death as well as trying to keep the Apaches at bay. With help from two local women the elderly Aline MacMahon playing tough rancher Kate Canady and Cathy O'Donnell playing Crisp's niece Barbara, Stewart eventually gains the trust of Crisp
0	Well made, well acted. But why glorify such subject matter? The Academy holds this movie up as a high-point of artistic achievement. Getting to know the workings of a psychotic mind can enrich you life, apparently
0	Boy, was this awful! This is a bad movie. A very bad movie. There are no words in which I can express how horrible that movie is
0	Phewww....Awful! I see that Freeman & Hackman are executive producers on this stinker. Just reaffirms, I guess, that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves. The truth in spades in this case. I think, as I'm sure millions do, that Freeman & Hackman are the very best around, but I've never seen them work with such stiff, stilted pathetically sensationalistic material. On top of which Hackman is terribly miscast & comes off shrill & artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like Ben Kingsley. Why oh why didn't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey & give it to Kenneth Branagh to direct them in a dream version of Othello
0	Not Really "As Time Goes By" - Beware as this is dated I purchased this and was not happy. This show was most certainly influential for the better and latter show, but by no means has the depth and excellent dialogue of "As Time Goes By"
1	Loved the series! Judi Dench is so great at this type of comedy. I would have loved to have seen her in something of Neil Simons. Her gift for repartee is impressive. As a long time watcher of "As Time goes By" I was delighted to find this series. Rather bittersweet that it was made with her husband, who she lost after a long and I gather successful marriage
