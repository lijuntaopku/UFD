0	No Good At All Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities. The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album. Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song. The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason. It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear. The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'. Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording. Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL
0	Recycled goods Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album. Stevens blatantly rips off his own music. I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and start there
0	TICKED OFF I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money. I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth. Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest. There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment. Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone. What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride? Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages? Hoochie mommas? What? Babyface? Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd! And what's up with the explicit lyrics? We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music? And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on? I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while. Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time. Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd
0	Better Stoned? Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre. I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something? If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song. Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.
0	Born to Croon Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse. Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like
0	Juelz should be missing his tongue Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money
0	Not a Tribute Any one who is a fan of Luther Vandross will be sorry if you purchase this CD. It's not a tribute.......it an abomination
0	Terrible garbage. Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real. Meanwhile, the only "music" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable "concert" you'll ever see. I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's.
0	Simply dull Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this
0	another loser band Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal. I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad
0	one of prince's worst albums! although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead
0	When something is already the best don't change it Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it!
0	Lightning don't strike twice, does it? When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great. This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, "Oh...that Alex!" sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of songs are presented as "Big Star." In Space is connected musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND. If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.
0	Curious... The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is. Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march. In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies. As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably
0	This is just a pathetic follow up. Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares? Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster. One of the worst albums of the decade.
0	Bubble gum rap Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out

0	The Decadent Downfall Of Mainstream Hip-Hop I find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented D.J. to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar; Ripping off the kids droned and purged on the MTV feedbag, and this man Paul Wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them. Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money. What excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me? Does it reach artistic heights? Or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame? And still people eat it up like Chicken N Dumplin's on a cold winter's day This is excactly whats very wrong with today's hip hop, it's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely Stay away from this awful garbage don't let MTV rob another cen
0	Unfortunately Clay has become a Vegas lounge act With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career. While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original. As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason. Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood.
0	Least Favorite Edwin Album Although it KILLS me to write anything less than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I just can NOT get into this album. Like others have said, I too have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. And I know people will say... "Give the album a chance"..... or... "Let Edwin grow and move in new musical directions". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It feels "flat" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul. I would pick up Austin Sessions over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best. Maybe he feels the pressure to write some "hits" so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this feels like he's trying too hard. I SOOOOOO hope he comes back with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!
0	Turn off the tv on the radio! This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice
0	Win some. Lose some. You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment
0	Humbly and Honestly I don't like it It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life. Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together
0	Another Retarded CD From Another RETARD!!!! DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!! Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity" and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!!
0	Wasn't That Funny I gave this a good listen, but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable
0	and the most generic music award goes to....... one word. generic. terrible. boring. (well, they are all one word) people must learn to have a better taste in music. granted there is at least one good song. a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals. if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra. my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said "thats enough". do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd. when will people learn!
0	Man f*** damn near all these so called hits. The most untalented producer in the business. Honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with Biggie and Black rob's only one hit. The rest of this is trash. Especially those chickenheads Total. And once again Puff tryin to eat off Biggie carcass. Dont give this bum anymore money, Just listen to Biggies two gems and "f" the rest
0	Too much of the same After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release. To say the least I am disappointed. I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep. Where is the range of work? All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me. I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating
0	Supergroups are super bad! I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful "supergroups". Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more? There's no such thing as a good supergroup. The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck. When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band. The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together. They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam. The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow. I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler. Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad! Thats right people! Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs? We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler." Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more. If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker! If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup
0	Not good When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads! Verdict: don't waste your money.
0	cure for insomnia this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic "development" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release "young man's disease" which is better than anything else i've heard this year.
0	Great Price...Not so good itself This a great priced cd, but the content is why it is so cheap. It's a true-amateur album. Beethoven Lover is over her/his head. This is the real world, not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world. Deal with it and agree with me. It isn't so great
0	Overrated???? Who could like a band like The Rolling Stones? They are not the world's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but Start Me Up and Shattered. Their new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard. Stay far away from that CD. Get anything from the Stones that contains Start Me Up or Shattered insted.
0	Worst album EVER!!!.... let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer.

0	What Is The Sound Of One Oar Flopping? There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks. Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars. Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....! Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people. With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience. The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there. One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes. Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful. Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard. But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music. One extra star in his memory.
0	My hips don't lie either... and they know this music stinks Every one is obbsessed with "Hips don't lie". Don't they relize that the songs horrible. Well, so is every other track on this album. Save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent
0	VERY BAD, MUSIC FOR PEOPLE WITH NO TASTE I HATE THE BEATLES. THEY ARE AMONGST MY MUSIC GUIDE TOP 20 WORST BANDS EVER. THEY ONLY MADE A FEW DECENT SONGS IN HEY JUDE, LET IT BE, AND BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST STINK! EVEN A MARK KNOPFLER CD WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS IS BETTER THAN THIS! LIKE I SAID, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES OR ZEPPELIN DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ABOUT, HUH!!! GOOD MUSIC IS REQUIRED DIRE STRAITS, GREEN DAY, FOREIGNER, GNR, METALLICA, AND NIRVANA. GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED. THE BEATLES SUCK!!!!
0	Retire PLEASE I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux. Everything after that is garbage. This album is no exception. Every song sounds the same and is very predictable. The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses? He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money. He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented. I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless. 1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again
0	!?!?!? I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap-Metal/Rock-Rap was Dead. Had potential, but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me

0	Overrated! Certainly not deserving of the Grammy (for cast recording). Each of the other nominated productions is MUCH BETTER than this poor excuse of a revival.

0	Garofalo is funny The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him. It's the only scene that made me laugh. The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak. Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie. The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch. His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch. The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable. The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad. She doesn't love him. She doesn't need him at all. She's done with him. The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb. That doesn't happen. If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you. Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny. The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids. The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done. Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on. Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad. Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day. To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying. The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on. But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something. It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family

0	Bad diction, engineering gimmicks besot otherwise noble effort A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two for Gounod. While still showing great promise, some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short here. "O souverain" from Le Cid continues to show Villazon's command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register, so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary. Diction here is already an issue, as many `u' vowels get dipthonged, especially when Villazon's sound is placed back for added weight and volume. `La reve' from Massenet's Manon is comfortably floated, with support from Natalie Dessay as Manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number. Would Villazon been able to sing the short aria by Alain (who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition - shades of Frau ohne schatten perhaps? - in almost a chamber opera), from Massenet's Griselidis (track 8), at least as softly and lightly, as both the music and dramatic situation require, this could have also been very successful. He instead turns the ABA shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it. The less often excerpted "Lorsque enfant" from Werther closes out the first Massenet set, as does "Pourquoi me reveiller" the second. Villazon's identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both. He capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection, and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well. It is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from Massenet's Roi de Lahore, featuring a hero (from Hindu myth) that bound to certain stipulations, has literally returned from the dead. Not quite as ostentatious as Massenet's near remake of Lohengrin, Esclarmonde (but with female protagonist instead), it is one of Massenet's most colorful scores. It has only been recorded complete once commercially, with Joan Sutherland, Luis Lima, and appearing only ten minutes apart, James Morris, and for the part of General unfortunately eliminated from this scene here, John Tomlinson, along with one other cut to Villazon's part. It would've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias. He captures the incipiently worried tone of Alim well, but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from French culture as where the opera takes place. Most successful of the Gounod selections are two of the three rarities. The first is Source delicieuse from Polyeucte, based on the Corneille play. It opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege. It perhaps has only been recorded once before and well, by Roberto Alagna ten years ago; Villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well, if not as securely as Alagna. Anges du paradis from Mireille (which Mirella Freni championed and recorded complete for EMI), is third, perhaps a study for Ah leve toi, soleil (Romeo), several years down the road. The second Gounod rarity on this disc is "Inspirez-moi, race divine," said to be a Caruso favorite, from Reine de Saba. Its text indicates King Solomon's prize hired builder, Adoniram, to be a very confident, if mildly haughty chap. Villazon's interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back, with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing Villazon engages in here. The high C at the end, however, is convincing. Such device as in the above, also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from Romeo et Juliette. "Ah! leve toi soleil" opens the first Gounod set, and is sung with the right ardor, conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops, coming off phrases. Villazon's entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat, and intonation gets momentarily derailed. "Salut, demeure" from Gounod's Faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome. Recitative and the beginning of the aria, "Ah! fuyez" from Manon begin well nuanced enough, and for the aria, truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc, but all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long. That leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two Massenet rarities, to close this recital - first, an aria from Roma, Massenet's swan song for the lyric theater and "Ah! parais" from Le Mage, opera with plot line similar to that of Verdi's Aida, following. The melody, introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter, somewhat takes after "Pays merveilleux" from Meyerbeer's Africaine, but in more voluptuous color, such as in Thais, and Villazon and Pido both capitalize well on its opulence. Pido's work, on numerous other numbers on this disc, seems heavy, lumbering, cloying, or just simply out of his idiom, so to speak. Word has it that Villazon, while not having a big voice, is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing. How this picked up a major award from Gramophone, for the specific problems this disc has, and over two more qualified nominations (Ciofi/Di Donato Handel Duets and a Florez album) is mystifying. So much digression here is over the very specific demands that French opera makes on singers. There's much reason for hope for this tenor, but this disc, for two-thirds of it, does little to help fulfill it
0	Disappointed The music for the soundtrack was so lame! I though I was gonna cry cause I figured this was the end of B2K by this point. The s'track wasn't even all B2K either. I like the song with Jhene and Omarion "Happy". Also I liked "Out of the Hood" other then that it was boring.
0	I GIVE THIRDS 2 I bought this cd for one song, &quot;Walk Away&quot; which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
0	Not as good as the origional. So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling. The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head. If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version.
0	Glorious Lack Of Sophistication Deep Lyrics man, I'm getting a lot out of this... But just wait for the next record when you'll get &quot;Hold On Loosely!&quot
0	Know the label... I didn't listen the disk but know the recording label. Never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when I was hooked by the low price: very poor immitations. Just go for the real things
0	Absoulutely rubbish, which you could find in your bin the day you buy it. Let me tell you, Shayne Ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks, if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today, face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him. Look at Justin Timberlake, where is he today, they go and move on, and thats what Shayne will do except alot faster. This song is so rubbish, the thing I hate so much is that he didn't even write this! So its not his own material, and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song, its not like these lyrics mean anything to him, as he did not write. And on "No Promises" thats even worse than this, yes he might of wrote it I don't know, but does the song have depth, or is it just a plain old expected pop song. By the way it's the second one. Shayne Ward has no protential, neather does anyone who comes of X Factor, its all just one big [...
0	Not my cup of tea One good song, of course "The sound of silence", and the studio version is far better than this one. I am not a fan of the genre as you might expect
0	gag These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene. It's like a few monkeys build a house, and all the other monkeys rave about it, but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat... whatever that means. I am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio. Buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere.
0	Great music in search of great mastering While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band. That said, The Moody Blues (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD, either. While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well. If I had to guess, I'd say much of the music contained on 'Gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections, and on the band's original CD albums. There are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc. For instance, the music track of 'Nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier CD versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess), but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples (albeit, in the full album form including The Late Lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener to stomach. I can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing. Whatever the reason, the original source material used for this CD could've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work. While I suspect that would've raised the asking price of 'Gold', I also would contend that great music DESERVES such caring treatment. As it is, too much of 'Gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished, which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of Au would've been impossible to do. But evidently in realm of the corporate music world, when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled CDs it's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up
0	"DAZED AND CONFUSED ABOUT THE ADVERTISING" I was looking to get the DVD of DAZED AND CONFUSED but got the CD. When it was advertised on the AMAZON website it led me to believe that it was a DVD as you see it above. (1993 Film) I had to return it and my expense. Very disappointing transaction with AMAZON. Threfore, i am not impressed
0	Kind of a disappointment Except for the song, Mother Mother, I didn't really care for the rest of the cd. I bought it for Mother, Mother so I guess I got what I wanted. I had hoped to like other songs as well, but, oh well
0	Very Disappionted This CD was supposed to expose a new side of Dar Willams, it has failed to do this. The lyrics, and songs are repetitive of previous works. I would suggest buying something else
0	How stupid! Stinkish-I totally agree with you 100%!!!! What was mattel thinking when they released this item? Some songs are ok, but "Hit me baby one more time?" That song is soooo old! And so yesterday, by lip singer, Hilary Duff, is sooooo yesterday!!!! You gotta be desperate for music to actually buy this or want it.If you think that i am way wrong then include me in your review
0	Chasm . . . Throw This Off A Cliff Ryuichi Sakamoto's credibility is on the precipice with Chasm, a turgid unlistenable work of crud. Check out Coro and Only Love Can Conquer Hate, both sound like factory machinery at work. Dire, dreadful and diabolical. Stop being the artiste Ryuichi and have a go at entertaining. Your fans deserve better
0	YUKK!!! She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment
0	A true disappointment Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD..
0	Too many birds While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud. Buyer beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all! Very misleading
0	Not even 1 star I really think Snoop is a good rapper. He should only have stopped 10 years ago. I'm very tired of his gizzle wizzle nizzle stuff, and I don't like none of the beats here. And what's left then? nothing. I found out after i bought this album: I'm not a snoop fan anymore... Old School is the bes
1	A fantastic album and a monumental disappointment I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time. Right from the first track, I was hooked. "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album. "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message. "Home" is just plain fun. "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful. However, I must say that the Four Songs version of "Orange Sky" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written. However, the Time Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original). The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the Four Songs version does. I will always be baffled by this remake. It is truly awful. Its only saving grace is that the original is still available. But that is by no means any reason to avoid this CD. In fact, those who do not know the original "Orange Sky" may fall in love with this one. But it is my duty to warn those looking for an "Orange Sky" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed. Outside of this single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own
1	Wonderful Christmas CD Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this. John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting. The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen. This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard. "Wassail Song" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform. You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD
1	Wrong titles for the songs This is one of the ultimate collection's of pure music at its finest....1 problem thou...on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names...kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection :(
1	One of the best This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period
1	The Mother of All Film Scores...at Long Last!!! This is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem. In my opinion, though, the only part of the entire CD that doesn't work is the beginning of the "Waxworks" track - the score to this particular moment in the film (when Norma, watching herself onscreen, rises triumphantly to proclaim "I'll be up there again, so help me!") is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom. In the original, the music is strong, powerful and almost spine-tingling, but this moment on the CD is underwhelming and not fully realized. However, what is one misfire (totalling all of eight bars, at most) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording?! In short, if you love film music, you most likely love the score to SUNSET BOULEVARD - and if you love SUNSET BOULEVARD, then you will most likely love this recording, too
1	A fantastic listen for the open-minded fan With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use. Only this time, he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. It would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote "Satch Boogie," "War" and "Flying in a Blue Dream" went. Well, he's still here, only more than ever he's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey. I've never heard robots having sex, but I'm willing to be "Borg Sex" isn't far off. And although his calmly passing, sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure, that's kinda how you'd expect to see "Clouds Race Across the Sky." The 'chorus' to "Devil's Slide" sounds as sinister as its name suggests and "Attack" is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as I've ever heard. To top it off, the album includes "Until We Say Goodbye," one of Satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue. If you're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The Alien-style, you'll find that there's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found. It's not a Satriani masterpiece, but its a true testament to the man's enduring creativity
1	A Must for Feat Heads! A grab bag of tasty goodies for all Feat fans. Several live tracks which never made it onto &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; and a deep well of out-takes, alternate versions and curios. Plus a hilarious explanation of Lowell's bottleneck of choice (because you can go just about anywhere and find one). If you love the Feat, you'll love this collection
0	Old Dude? Do Ben Clark's teenage fans realize that he's pushing thirty? The dude is OLD. He's not a young jackass, he's an OLD jackass. And isn't it a bit creepy that an OLD dude like Ben tries so hard to appeal to 14-year-olds? Check out the Lashes MySpace profile. Creeeeepy!
1	stands the test of time I don't write reviews; my opinion is my own and it only matters to those who love me. Still..."Amos Lee" stands the test of time. How long ago did I buy this CD? I played it to death when I got it. Had to go see Amos when he came to town. Talked my sister into going with me. "You'll like him, he's low key, kind of jazzy-bluesy-folk music." Recently popped the CD back into the CD player. It's still soooo good for relaxing, slowing down, chillin'. My daughter surprised me when the music started. She said, "Is this Amos Lee?!! I love this CD." And she's a 13 year old (self-described)orchestra nerd who loves modern hard rock: emo. If you haven't gotten this one yet, but you've been thinking about it, stop waiting. It's intellingent, sophisticated, difficult to classify, and won't get old
1	Journey of a Gemini -- This CD is WONDERFUL !!! This is my first Donell Jones' CD, and I can truly say this is by far perhaps the best CD I've heard in several years by any artist. The tracks from start to finish are great, and I found myself listening to the CD all day the first time I played it. What prompted me to buy the CD was the song I'm Gonna Be which I hear more on my satellite radio stations than I have locally here in Michigan. And because of the quality of music, I very rarely buy CD's anymore, however, after hearing I'm Gonna Be, I was telling a friend how much I liked that song and my friend happened to have the CD and only after listening to maybe 3 or 4 other tracks, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I LOVE THIS CD - GREAT JOB, DONELL !!! What I am disappointed in is the lack of promotion for this CD. It just burns me up when there are some non-mainstream artists with a great product and for whatever (dumb) reason, the marketing depts. of the record companies that don't actively promote artists such as Donell Jones who have quality products. There isn't even a video out, which in this day and age, an artist must have a video to further promote their product(s). So shame on JIVE RECORDS (and all the other record companies) who don't actively and aggressively promote CD's with the quality that this one exhibits. I recommend this CD to anyone who can appreciate good quality R&B - both youngheads and oldheads (I'm an old head in my mid-40's). I have been doing my own promotion for this CD and will contact my local radio stations to ask that they include I'M GONNA BE in their rotation.
0	Garbage compared to &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; Their first album &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; was a 5 star masterpiece, unfortunately this one is horrible. There are only 2 good tracks on this album, both which are deep and reminiscent of &quot;Let's Get Free.&quot; One is &quot;Sellin D.O.P.E.&quot; and the other is &quot;Look Around&quot; which is already featured on Beatnuts' &quot;Musical Massacre,&quot; and to make things worse they chop off 3 minutes of the song. The other tracks are boring and uninspiring. They completely changed up their entire formula as if to impress the commercial heads who know nothing about real hip hop. The beats are either recycled or &quot;snare- happy, throw them bows&quot; type beats that are for a whole different crowd of listeners then their first CD. It's much like a book with no pages. Shine with no substance. It's too bad that with their first joint they dropped a gem on us and then with this one strayed away from their roots. I'm optimistic that they will soon get back to the old Dead Prez formula that made &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; so great. But until then, don't pick this one up
0	(2.5 Stars) Not Missing Much With This CD Wu-Tang Clan has seen better times. I remember a day when you couldn't help but love everything Wu put out either as a group or individually. Remember the good ole days of Enter The Wu-Tang, Liquid Swords, Tical, Only Built For Cuban Linx, and Ironman? Now years later, the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim. Don't get me wrong, Ghostface Killah laid it down with his latest album Fishscale. But Clifford Smith a.k.a. Method Man is a totally different story. 4:21...The Day After continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling. There are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic "Is It Me" or the posthumous verse of ODB on "Dirty Mef." You can even accept songs such as the Lauryn Hill assisted "Say," the Erick Sermon produced "Gotta Have It," or even "Let's Ride" featuring Ginuwine as being decent. One thing that's become obvious is the fact that he can't hold it down alone like he did with Tical. But a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we've become accustom with from Method Man. I mean, "Somebody Done F*cked Up" has some energy, but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once. The majority of 4:21...The Day After is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both Method and his guest artists. Streetlife brings his wackness to songs like "4:20" and "Everything" (the latter also features an uninspiring verse from Inspectah Deck.) And you would think putting Method, Rza, and Raekwon on a track would be a banger, but "Presidential M.C." comes and goes without much fanfare. Other weak selections include "Konichiwa B*tches," "4Ever" featuring Megan Rochell, and "Fall Out." I honestly can't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21....The Day After except to complete their Method Man collection. This album won't get much pub from Def Jam and it seems Method Man is going through the motions at this day in his career. Everyone had high hopes for Method Man's career...but it seems like the only high he'll be getting is with a blunt.
0	Isreal Symphomy Ochrester Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him
0	Johnny Ramone does NOt play electric heavy metal guitar!! Frist of all this is an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams
1	Oh so beautiful....there's nothing else like it I can't explain how powerfully this album moves me. At first listen, I was disappointed. There was no "Night of the Swallow," no "Moving," or other rousing songs that make me want to dance, alone, in the night. Then, I read someone's review which spoke of listening to this album in a dark room alone. I made time for this album. Time alone for me is scarce, but I missed Kate and made room for her. We cooked together, went on long walks, even went running once or twice. I fell in love with "Sunset" first. The flamenco guitars, the rhythm picking up, the multiple sky images. I listen to this and feel one with the sky. It is such a positive, beautiful album. Listening to it feels like a religious experience. This is not party music. It's not for socializing either. I had a good friend over and I just wanted to tell her to stop talking so I could soak in this beautiful, beautiful music. Kate's voice is softer here. She wears her motherhood comfortably, and it shows, yet she still has that incredible vocal range. I had thought that there was no surprises left in music for me. I was wrong. That doesn't mean I like all songs equally. I listen to the songs on the first disk (especially while running), but it's disk 2 that captured my heart. "Sunset," then "Nocturn." Then, sweet "Aerial:" "I want to be up on the roof I've gotta be up on the roof Up, up high on the roof Up, up on the roof In the sun." I am trying to say that this album is a visceral experience. You have to live it, immerse yourself in it, give yourself over to it. For those of you disappointed with it, I recommend giving it another chance. Especially listen to it outside. I think you might yourself similarly entranced as I was.
1	Better then Trouble I liked Trouble but I think this CD is a little better. I like the musical arrangements better this time around. The addition of John Medeski and Chris Wood give the music a deeper more full sound. Trouble sounded mostly like Ray playing an acoustic guitar. Where Till the Sun Turns Black really has some excelent backing musicians. Lyrically I like both about the same. I say to get both discs they have alot to offer.
1	Listen to it and love it Guys, if you've got feelings for Tim, you're gonna love this one. If you know anything about honest to God country music, this is what you look for. This guy is extremely good and his music fits
0	Dumb Franchize Boyz Dem Franchize Boyz drifted around the ATL music scene and dropped a number of independent releases, but then their song "White Tee", while not necessarily becoming a major hit by Billboard standards, did give them some brief attention. But that's nothing compared to the popularity they've received thanks to their latest album, On Top of Our Game. I personally don't see what the big deal is about this album. Before I listened to it, I thought I would be annoyed by all the snap music, but it turns out that the problem isn't necessarily the music itself, but the below-average lyrics that all four members of Dem Franchize Boyz put on wax. I never was that impressed by "I Think They Like Me" (an obvious single because it's censored), but the thing is, that's actually the best song on the album. Many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter, like cars ("Ridin' Rims"), bling-blingin' ("You Know What It Is"), and hardcore sex ("Freaky As She Wanna Be" -- and why does Trey Songz keep wasting his talent like this?). The choruses can get a little uncreative too: "Don't Play With Me" has "B, don't play with me" while "Stop Callin' Me" has "B, stop callin' me" (by the way, calling the latter song wack would be an understatement). And "They Don't Like That" makes me wonder if they were reading our minds. The production also tends to get repetitive; when I heard "Suckas Come and Try Me", I felt like singing: "I think I think they like me!" And the remix of "White Tee" is unnecessary, especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here. I'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz are the same group. The only thing more annoying than the group's rapping is when Damon Dash shows up on "Bricks 4 the High". No, he isn't rapping; he's instead talking -- no, not talking; WHINING about severed ties with Jay-Z and Roc-a-Fella (*sigh*...is he still talking about that?). In the end, while I wouldn't call this the worst So So Def album ever (Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1 gets that honor), it's pretty darn close. If this is Dem Franchize Boyz at the top of their game, what does rock bottom look like? Anthony Ruper
1	Moneen is On This CD! I have not heard this CD yet but...Moneen is on it and Moneen rocks my world. So check this CD out because Moneen is on it
0	Disappointing ..these 3 have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so I can't understand why they put this out. The album lacks quality, imagination, energy, and inspiration. There isn't one G funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff. I've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole CD in a short space of time. To you Gangsta listeners out there, don't waste your money....i ain't gonna go on any more about this album so if you don't believe me..buy it
0	If he is following Bright Eyes, he has a lot of maturing to do First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar. But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking "when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet. However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake It's Morning" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking.
0	You had to be there ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE ON OTHER ALBUMS. This is an audio recording from multi-media presentations. Much of the material is geared around visuals and Anderson's stage personnae. This is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture. You get the general idea what is going on, but you miss a lot. It is not like listening to a football game over the radio, where the broadcasters explain what you aren't seeing. Without the visuals to go with this CD, many of the stories and jokes come up flat. This CD set is about 4 and a half hours long. It was taken from several years of Anderson's live shows that eventually became the United States. Each CD more or less covers a specific "tour". Her back up band changes from CD to CD. You can tell that as time goes on, she gets more famous (and maybe has more money) she is able to add more to the shows (and her backup band gets bigger). The sound quality is amazingly good. It is sharp and crystal clear. There is almost no audience noise, which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories. About 80% of the material is spoken word. There is some music. It is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production. The recordings come from early in her career. She later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums. I would suggest getting her other CD's. Or if you want to see her performance art work, I would suggest searching out the Home Of the Brave VHS tape (I don't think it has been released on DVD). Don't get the Home of the Brave CD
0	An alternative view This came out when I was 12: it would have been far too 'difficult' an album for a young whippersnapper and I was only vaguely aware that the Bunnymen existed at that time. In my early teens I bought a few Bunnymen singles and Ocean Rain; now, 24 years later, I'm trying to fill in the rest of the Bunnymen jigsaw. After a week of repeated listening, I'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways. Either, you judge it by its stand out songs, which are far and few between: if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards, you're doing better than me. Alternatively, you can put it in context: appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-U2 sound, (which I have to say does precious little to endear it to me). If you're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake, it's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from Joy Division to U2 within a couple of years. However, if like me you think both Joy Division and U2 are vastly overated, this really isn't going to do much for you. It's determindly bleak, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but this also captures the Bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody: only 'Over the Wall' and 'A Promise' deliver a decent hook. I've seen Heaven Up Here described as a work of 'rare beauty'. It can also cause a tense, nervous headache. If you're interested in the early 80's British underground scene, then of course you should hear it, along with the other Bunnymen albums. Compared to the lush Scott Walker-esque Ocean Rain, though, this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding.
0	The most overrated album in history! Never a Beach Boys fan I had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews. What a dissapointment. I just don't get it. &quot;God only knows&quot; is indeed a masterpiece, but the rest of the album is filled with boring music that does nothing for me. I've tried multiple listenings to make sure I'm not missing anything, but the plain truth is that this album stinks. I was expecting some deep music as described by some Beach Boys fans, but the best use I can get out of this album is using it as a coaster. In a word, BORING
0	It's a joke Very bad selection of songs, most of them you alredy have in others Bee Gees collections like number ones or the record. It would be much better if the producers choice new songs like country lanes, or tears and remaster them. Any real fan can make a better list
1	Scarling surpasses Jack Off Jill This proves that Scarling is an original and creative band, far surpassing Jack Off Jill. All JOJ fans can be sure, that Scarling is no JOJ reborn, but is it's own band, inovative and brain-tickling. What a refreshing break from the norm! ~Mirlin Popla
1	Now wait one minute ! Now, I know I'm not the only one that realizes that critics barely know what the hell their talking about. I must admit that the first time I heard this album I was not that thrilled by it. But the more I heard it, it quickly became one of my favorites. I think this album is very underated and quite brilliant. I believe that this album allowed Prince to develope as an artist in a big way.
1	Great! Simply put, this is a classic. The album is basically perfect and not one of the tracks are 'fast-forward-able'. Black Thought gets better with each release and the band seems to get tighter and tighter with their chemistry and sound. The guest appearances are great too. This is the album that clearly defined them as the pioneers they are
1	Super Happy Funky & Energizing!!! Every time I listen to this album, I have to jump up and down!!! Lot's of fast tempo beats and super fun lyrics! I highly recommend it
1	Unbelievable First off to avoid any conflict of interest claims I admit that I an a huge Rod Stewart fan. That being said, I just wasn't interested in hearing him do the old American classics(which I also love). I just didn't see how he could do them justice, that is, until I saw his DVD "Live from Royal Albert Hall" in which he did several of the songs from his first "Great American Songbook". I was just blown away. These songs were now his. I went to the computer to order one of the CDs but my wife talked me into getting all three and I am surely not sorry. I believe that there are very few CDs available with no weak tracks(there are some) but here are three that just don't have a weak track(IMHO). He has made all of these great songs his. My all time favorite song is "Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael. I had never heard a version that I thought could top his, until now. If you love the old standards you should really give these 3 CDs a listen. They'll melt your heart!!!
0	What's become of the Great American Songbook? This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series. Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully. I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture. More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way. That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead.
1	Lots of dusty folk songs about a hard life they love--Live Disc 1. Buskers who have been together long enough to tighten up, play inside each others' moves, and develop a distinctive style all their own-dusty folk songs about a hard life they love. Subdudes come to mind. They document life on the road, in a beloved Australia, and their personal lives in up-close personal terms. Striking phrases of lyrics repeatedly grab my attention. They fans love them and they love entertaining them. Disc 1 is a revelation. [72:04] Disc 2 offers more of the same. Maybe too much of a good thing all at once-the distinctive style gets a little claustrophobic. And yet, I want to hear more. Watch for last track. [68:15]
0	Puts the Dead back in Dead Prez This is typical political hip hop. Rants, slander, and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories. All accompanied by weak beats, bad lyrics, and terrible performances by M(oron)-1. This political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped. Save your money and buy Ghostface's new album. This will be surely headed to my list of the year's worst albums. Big Big Big Big Thumbs down
0	yuck Sounds like every other I'm such a sensitive sad male garbage that is flooding corporate radio stations. Boo hoo. The bravado of these people to take a beautiful song (all is full of love) and puke on it. It really makes me sick to my stomach
0	Lil Jon - Lil Talent Okay let me get this straight. If I wear dreadlocks, throwback sports apparel, big sunglasses, put some radiators in my mouth, act drunk, and scream lame unintelligible raps I too can be a big star? Alas, there is no accounting for taste or the lack thereof. Scuse me whilst I look for a bridge to leap from
0	bonus DVD is a DUD I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and was really looking foward to his his new DVD, Modern Times, and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus DVD in two dvd players i have,and lent it to a friend to try,and neither one of us could get it to play.I should have returned it,but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play,as stated,i was just disgusted. I desided not to order any more music DVDs from Amazon.I must say that the music on the first DVD was great,starting with Thunder On The Mountain,it was good to listen to some new Dylan.
1	Brave New World Laurie Anderson recently applied for and was hired as kitchen worker at McDonald's hamburger joint near her studio in Manhattan. Huh???...yes it's true, and she recounts her McDonalds experience in her new performance piece, "Happiness". Laurie Anderson can find beauty in strange places. At Town Hall, eight short days after the collapse of the Trade Towers, Laurie found beauty in a terrifying place. She performed "Love Amoung the Sailors", from her Bright Red album and the lyric..."There is no pure land now, no safe place...If this is the work of an angry God, I want to look in his angry face..." ; becomes a prophetic statement of iron willed resolve. "Let X=X" takes on a new meaning as we, the listeners, are placed in an aisle seat of a burning plane. George Bush talked about "wanted dead or alive" and "hunting down terrorists like dogs" and Laurie Anderson talked about the phenomena of flaming birds in the sky after the American planes became guided missles from hell. Now, one year later as Sadam becomes the ghost of Osama, I look to Laurie Anderson's concert at Town Hall as a defining moment in a Brave, New World. Laurie Anderson (not Rudy Guliani) is New York's first citizen and the heart and soul of this planet, Earth
1	Prince Serves Notice To The World On This Seminal 80's LP!! Man, what can I say about this album but CLASSIC!! Prince was 23 when he dropped this one and forever served notice to the world that he was a different kind of kat and that the whole scape of the pop world as we had known it at that time was going in HIS direction! Never one to conform or confine himself to any one particular musical genre, he delves into new wave & punk (Dirty Mind, When You Were Mine), then grooves us with the nasty but infectious "Do It All Night"... Then he goes into the album's only slow jam, the lamenting "Gotta Broken Heart Again", which is a classic to true Prince fans who go all the way back with him! Then Side 2 opens with the punk-funky "Uptown", which truly captures the vibe of the times of pre-aids, experimental, ambisexual, free-lovin' late 70's / early 80's america!-- Which is the world that I came of age in! (I was 16 when this album came out and it seemed that Prince was reading my mind!) Then at the end of "Uptown" there's a cool synthesizer effect that swooshes us right into the classic gut-bucket synth funk of "Head", which is self- explanatory! Then, at the end of that, the same synth swoosh takes us into Prince's tabu tale of incest as a streetkid of 16 who lives (albeit antagonistically!) with a half sister of 32 who is determined to teach him her warped view of the facts of life or else "Put him on the street again!"-- A punked-out, rockin', fast-moving piece that caused quite a stir back then! Then the synth swoosh takes us to one of my all-time fave Prince "Party Til' You Pass Out!" jams.... "Party Up"!! This song sends this classic album out with a bang! The "Dirty Mind Tour" of late '80 and early '81 was quite a spectacle to behold! Prince broke all the taboos of sexuality, fashion, staging and just brought a whole new energy to the game that just caught you on fire! He was the opening act (at that time!) for then "supposedly" notorious Rick James (RIP), whose "Fire It Up" tour was all the rage! But to those of us who were lucky enough to see it, it soon became apparent that Prince's flame made poor Rick's look like a bic lighter! After about 3 months of what was supposed to be a 6 month tour as Rick's opening act, tired of being upstaged, Rick James fired Prince from the tour and harbored a bitter resentment of him which lasted up until about a year before his death in 2004 when he had to finally acknowledge that Prince Rogers Nelson was indeed a true genius and a force of nature! If you don't have this album in your collection, you're short-changed 4-real!
1	I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself either Excellent, excellent, excellent! I love this raw sound of the White Stripes that doesn't sacrifice the melody. Jack shows he is one of the best rockers out there (and Meg, well, you gotta love Meg!). Standout tracks are Seven Nation Army (which sounds like Salvation Army), Ball and Biscuit (I love to crank up the solos!), I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself, You've Got Her In Your Pocket, and even In The Cold, Cold Heart (You go Meg!). Yes, the drums are choppy in places, but it works well with the White Stripes and you gotta admit - there is no one else like them. They are original and are here to stay

0	disappointed I bought this CD based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old. Some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense. My daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song. ("There's a Little Wheel A-Turnin In My Heart" and "Pig on Her Head"). I really didn't like "I'm a Mess" which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter. I would recommend instead Karyn Henley's CDs which I found to be the best out there for the toddler age group (3-5 yrs). She tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter. The songs are wholesome and innocent
0	Way Overrated Out of this whole CD, I could only pick about 3 songs that I liked. This CD is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying. The best songs on here are Everything Part I, II/ Bow Before The King and Victory. Past those songs, there is not much because I can't bear to listen to the rest. Those two songs get 1 star each
0	fun, but not appropriate for kids - violent lyrics This CD is fun and musically intriguing, but not appropriate for kids... one song talks about "what can you do in a case like that but stamp on your mother, and your toothbrush, and on everything that's helpless." Another talks of being an immigrant to the country and says "and they beat me, and they banged me, and they left me on the ground." And another says "I'm a great sharpshootress. There is nothing that I can't shoot in the eyes, or the ears, or the teeth, or the fingers." Musically it's fun and goofy and intriguing, but I was appalled when I realized what I was encouraging my young child to listen to.
0	Should have changed name, simple as that. This band claiming to be hopesfall is not! There is only one original member left, they should of changed their name with the release of atypes, no question. Atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in NC! I would have respected them if they changed their band name
0	An ode to the 90's How can a group fall as far as they did? "Who Can You Trust" and "Big Calm" were both classics (dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another). Now with "FoF" it just went down hill...and never came back
0	I wanted so badly to like this. I really couldn't wait to get this CD. I wanted so badly to like it. But - it is just too bluegrassy for me. Every single song. It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old. Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great. You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along. Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's
1	Innovative musical hybrid This CD re-release of their 1981 album has been substantially enhanced by the addition of many previously unreleased tracks. It opens with their masterpiece Wheel Me Out, an eerie and evocative piece with addictive beats and strange interpolations by vocalist Liz Weiss. The hit title track is a funky rap, Where Did You Heart Go? a mellow soulful ballad with great sax and Tell Me That I'm Dreaming a complex piece with many samples and unusual vocal arrangements. Oh Mr Friction has a jerky rhythm, meandering saxophones and rap-style vocals, whilst Carry Me Back To Old Morocco has an innovative instrumental mix and fun lyrics, reminiscent of their James Brown song. It's An Attack with its delicious sax patterns is closer to a rock song but with a jazzy edge, whilst The Sky's Ablaze is a spoken poem with minimal instrumentation. The additional tracks provide a wider perspective on the virtuosity of this unique band whose music remains hard to categorize. My favorites are Christmas Time In Motor City and the dub version of the title track. The list of vocalists and instrumentalists on this innovative album is quite phenomenal. Was (Not Was) certainly contributed to making the early 1980s a very interesting period in popular music.
0	This Is One Common Project that Made Absolutely No Sense I am a Common fan. I have all of his projects and go out of my way to get all the music that he is featured on or artists that he aligns himself with personally. If he's on it or likes it, its alright at the very least. Or at least thatw what I thought. This Album was indeed eccentric to say the very least. Unfortunately, what many do not realize, is that just because it is different does not make it good. This album is not good. The same socially conscious message is there for the most part and that is the only reason I dont give it a one. The Production overall is horrible and though the message is the same, the lyrics are not quite as sharp. His worst effort clearly. Some cat on this page said that it is better than Can I Borrow A Dollar and One Day It'll All Make Sense........he's on some extremely potent narcotic drug to say that. He cannot beleive that himself. That is the most single ridiculous critique of a solid Hip Hop album that I have ever heard. Nothing personal, but I by no means agree with him and neither would any other head who has heard either of the albums. He's CRAZY!!
1	Favorite DCFC album When you listen to a cd, why do you listen to it? Simply because it sounds cool, or you enjoy how it relaxes you, or it fits a certain atmosphere? If that's how you listen to cd's, don't bother getting this album. I wouldn't want you to. This album is best enjoyed by those who listen to something because they get the feeling inside of it. I don't know why so many people here call this album pop and lighthearted. I completely disagree. The lyrics are not particularly dark, as opposed to maybe, lyrics from Alice in Chains' "Dirt", but they aren't exactly happy either. I absolutely love them. "Sleep Spent" is a great song. There is a lot more to this album than everyone seems to let on. The key to DCFC's music is that it takes a lot of listening before you actually get it, and the emotional value begins to sink in. I have been listening for three years, and just in the last six months or so, has the meaning of their music, the emotion behind it, the depression, sadness, and confusion finally begin to show themselves through the tone of Ben's voice and the guitar riffs. I'm not suggesting this is a depressing album, in fact it's rather comforting. Most of their albums are.
0	the new rubbish its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it
0	self-referential bs, and not of the good kind I've probably listened to "crane wife" several dozen times (one of the perks of working for a hipster clothing retailer) and after rolling meloy's lyrics around in my head for a month or so i can honestly say that he has created the pirate-prog rock song cycle of the year, which somehow is not as cool as you'd think it might be. what i really don't understand is the slavering fanboyism this band seems to inspire within some "intellectual" music fan circles. just because you need to use a dictionary to decpiher meloy's overblown dickensian narratives doesn't make them well-written or intelligent. instead "the crane wife" is the newest addition to the recycled 18th Century story sketches meloy doesn't seem to be able to depart from. maybe i'm just too picky but lyrics such as "Produced my pistol, then my saber to make no whistle or thou will be murdered" from "the island" come off as extremely silly, especially when filtered through meloy's extremely nasal delivery. the "crane wife" titled-tracks produce some interesting images, but ultimately lose their effectiveness due to meloy's weakness for 10-dollar-words. overall, the whole album sinks under the weight over over-writting, over-singing, and over-playing. meloy and co. should put down the dickens for a little while and read some william carlos williams.
0	Very disappointing I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it
0	Stay away from this album I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!! In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way. Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin
0	HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When brian goes to his first race in the eclipse there is a song that starts "tell me whats the secret im missing and im...." i would really appreciate it if someone could tell me the name of the song and the artist. Thanks.
1	"HISTORY IN THE MAKING" If I were to rate the packaging, I would have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the way it was made, I've had the discs fall out several times myself. But it's a beautifully packaged and recorded document(in its appearance and sound) that I listen to constantly. One problem I have when I look at the roster of talent, is I'm reminded or our own mortality; so many of these people are now dead, and the era that followed can never replace what was here. That could be good, though, they all sound so alive here, enhanced by one of the best bands ever to grace a stage. As an aside, I wonder why people call a death "passing away," or just "passing." They didn't "pass," they died; there's no shame in saying it. Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, Carl Radle, and Pop Staples are all dead; go ahead, say it. I don't think they'll mind. Nobody flinches at the word "suicide" when talking about Richard Manuel, but let Rick Danko peacefully drift off in his sleep, and he "passes away." These things have always puzzled me. Back to the music; it's all good, so much talent crossed that stage that night, the audience had a real treat. The Band's songs cover such a wide spectrum of topics, and I understand the guys resenting Robertson's appropriation of the writing credits, but these are men who have definitely walked the walk, and because of that, they are certainly able to talk the talk. You can hear the heartbreak in Rick Danko's delivery of "It Makes No Difference," and the effects of the hard life in Richard Manuel's voice in "The Shape I'm In," and even more so in "Acadian Driftwood." His voice here is hoarse and ragged and PERFECT. Levon Helm summed up Manuel's demons quite well in in The Band's "Authorized Biography," and in his book, "This Wheel's On Fire." He said "That's between him and his Higher Power, and I've always tried to keep from having too much of an opinion about it." He is still shaken over it this many years later, you can see it in the video, because here, he just clams up, takes a big drag on his cigarette, and looks off somewhere into the distance. I can see in him a sense of betrayal by one of his closest friends, and the knowledge that it will always hurt. This is relevant to "The Last Waltz," because there was a sense of brotherhood with these guys, from the beginning, all the way through, until huge success started to splinter that element. They were so good, and to watch this, knowing that these five will never grace a stage or studio in this form again, has the feeling of ending, of winding down, and being forced to say goodbye when you don't want to say goodbye. Even though the sequencing is out of order, and there were a few omissions from the show, it's still a magnificent document of one of the greatest live performances of the era, one of the best
0	the fall of the beastie boys! this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff
1	waited too long to get it i didnt have the most remote idea that i was going to like this album this much. My only experience from the band was Clint Eastwood and recently Feel Good, which even though i thought it was great i wasnt too crazy about it.But i recently watched the whole Demon Days album played at the Manchester Opera House and...oh man! i was totally blown away! the performance waas amazing, i totally loved the songs, and all the energy that is coming from that stage makes you get up on your feet and start singing too. God! i wish i could have been there!i had to buy the cd, love kids with guns, dirty harry, last living souls. Even the soft and mellow songs are amazing. I was talking to a friend when i started watching the DVD and i had to put the phone down.if you like something different, away from the ordinary, catch Damon albarn this time
1	like wow man When I think of Greg Dulli, I think, why isn't this guy in more cigarette commercials? Also people have told me that I look like him, so I always want to check out with my doppelganger is up to. In the 1990s, Greg Dulli carried the weight called the Afghan Whigs and challenged everyone's attention largely on the force of his personality. That is so me. Outside of Kurt Cobain, Dulli is the only real charmer from ten years ago. His music was honest and cool and had R&amp;B and Motown sophistication. Dulli now peeps his head over the fence with Blackberry Belle. Dulli pissed his territory with songs about love and suicide in a style of a smooth operator. His voice is more confident than ever. His new outfit seems more musical than the Afghan Whigs which were limited to their usual rock and rock paths. This is like when Nick Cave left the Birthday party to do much more stylish music on a bigger scope. I think Barry Adamson and Kid Congo are available for employment. I look forward to more records and shows
0	Good job Bebe and Joel... sorry, Ann. A not bad recording of this, in my view, poor and rather over-rated show. Amazing orchestration and the performances of Bebe Neuwirth and Joel Grey stop this recording from falling in the gutter of musical tattle. The cast is nothing to get excited about quite frankly, although Bebe Neuwirth is a real treat as Velma. I wish the same could be said about her co-star. Reinking, with her voice similar to the noise of clattering shovels, manages to (allbeit in the "Broadway-darling" style we have grown accustomed to) take awfulness to great new heights. The only thing that is good about her performance, quite frankly, is when it stops... reminiscent of that blissful moment when people stop playing bagpipes. Having said this, her acting is great, giving the character of Roxie depth and meaning - however ancient she portrays her. This is something Gwen Verdon tried and failed at. On balance though, Reinking's badness outweighs anything else, sadly. Neuwirth with her "older" style of voice and singing makes her seem to own the role of Velma Kelly here, although she does over-do the older-portrayal sometimes. Joel Grey lights up this recording with a superb performance and with much ease. On the whole, this isn't the best recording if this show I've heard, but its certainly not the worst. A good buy if you know the show well, but, apart from that, steer clear for now.

1	Three Cheers for Artistic Bravery I grew up in the 80's, during the heyday of great dramatic metal bands like Iron Maiden and Queensryche. Now that I'm older (and a professional musician myself with years of classical training), I can recognize the cheesiness of the bands that I loved when I was a kid. But I can still listen to a lot of that material and appreciate the musical and poetic ambition, the theatricality and the grandeur that the bands of that day were earnestly striving toward. I got "Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge" for free, and I probably wouldn't have even given it a listen if I hadn't been so intrigued by the cover art (which it turns out was done by the lead singer of My Chemical Romance). I'm embarrassed to say that I just associated this band with legions of mindless teeny-bopper fans and I couldn't even imagine liking their music. In retrospect, I see that that is an insult to the band and to its fans (who are clearly on to something). It's been a long time since I've been excited about a rock band. The last five or six years have been discouraging ones for mature pop music fans. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like, in the wake of September 11th, 2001, we've been awash in nostalgia acts: The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Killers, The Scissor Sisters, Jet, Gnarls Barkley, Franz Ferdinand and the like. These are acts that deliberately attempt to evoke another era, not only with the sound and composition of their music, but also by the way they dress and even by their bands' names. It's true that pop music has always mined the past for inspiration, but these "retro-parody" acts, as I call them, shamelessly attempt to recreate a specific musical sound of an earlier time without bringing any stylistic innovation to the artistic process; the music could easily be mistaken for material recorded 20 or 30 years ago. And while I actually like some of the work being produced by these bands, I feel that this approach represents the worst kind of artistic cowardice, for it allows the artist to hide behind a veneer of irony. Like foam trucker hats, this kind of art mocks the style while copping the style at the same time. The artists puts nothing of himself into the art, and therefore risks nothing. In a day and age when real life seems dark and complicated, it's easy to understand the appeal of retro-parody music; it transports us to an imaginary time when life was simple, even simplistic, and when nonsensical music reflected that simple-minded aesthetic. The more I listen to "Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge", the more I admire the sheer audacity of this record. The first time through, I couldn't shut it off; the album is a RELENTLESS attack of high-energy pop/punk, replete with rhythmic drive, wailing guitars, infectious hooks and lots of screaming. Even so, I thought the album might be a bit much for me- a little over the top, a little too dramatic. But I was intrigued by the lyrics, which seemed to be trying to tell a story, so I went online and poked around and found out that "Three Cheers" is in fact a concept album that tells the story of a man who must kill 1,000 evil souls in order to be reunited with his lover. I also found an interview with the band where they explained that they intended "Three Cheers" to be completely dramatic, theatrical and totally over-the-top; I'd say they succeeded on all three counts. I realized that My Chemical Romance is a kind of anomaly in today's pop music sphere. They represent the rare breed of artist who is willing to take a huge risk for the sake of making an original artistic statement. No one out there is doing anything remotely like this; while MCR might sound stylistically similar to other bands out there, I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the only band making big, dramatic, SINCERE concept albums (in the line of "Operation:Mindcrime" and "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"). I emphasize the word "sincere" because I think it's hugely important to the MCR phenomenon. While retro-parody acts mimic and mock the style and dress of 70's and 80's bands for a cheap thrill and a quick buck, My Chemical Romance clearly recognize that the great music of those decades was written with sincere intentions, and this is manifest in MCR's own music, which reflects the influence of their predecessors without ever sounding quite like any of them (you'd never mistake My Chemical Romance for an 80's or even a 90's band). The fact that My Chemical Romance is hugely popular among people half my age (I'm in my early 30's) almost turned me off to the band. But I'm starting to realize that this kind of musical snobbery is self-defeating, and when it comes to pop music it may be that teenagers are sometimes more likely to recognize a good thing. Pop music critics, most of whom are my age or older, naturally fawn over the retro-parody acts, as these bands validate, by obsequious imitation, the music of the critics' own youth. But while the critics live in the past, I'm not surprised that MCR, whose lyrics sincerely and directly reflect the moral ambiguities of our own troubled times, have found many loyal young fans. When you think about what this band is attempting on "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge", it's actually pretty amazing that they pull it off. It would have been less surprising to see a band with this kind of grand artistic ambition simply fall flat, getting bogged down in solipsistic lyrics and ornate, melancholy music. But that doesn't happen here, because these guys have the talent, the wit, and the chops to make it happen. The music, in fact, is probably the most surprising thing happening here. Forgetting for a moment the concept, the hype, the theatricality and all the rest, no one can dispute the fact that there is a high degree of musical talent at work on this album. Sure, the songs are basically formulaic- most good pop music is. But the songwriting is solid, accomplished and unique. The single "Im Not Okay", for instance, with its carefully-plotted and infectious vocal line, could almost have been ghost-written by a professional songwriter; but the quirky lyrics mark it as unmistakably original, an irresistable anthem for a new generation . It's easy to lose sight of MCR's strong compositional skill under all the screaming and the eyeliner, etc., but, to me, that makes it all the more admirable- the fact that the musical artistry of this band is never thrust in your face as something to be admired; it's just quietly at work, the motor driving this mad machine. Not only are the songs remarkably well-crafted, but the execution of the songs is impressive, too. The sound of the band is incredibly tight, with dual guitars dominating the music texture. The lead singer does a lot of screaming, but also a lot of really excellent singing. He has a semi-obnoxious, but clear and strident voice, and a pretty wide vocal range. Forceful and propulsive, the album is pretty much a shot of musical adrenaline from start to finish, with a short interlude (track #8) that works to break up the texture a little bit. The only thing that prevented me from giving this album a full five-star review is the fact that tracks #11 & #12 tend to lag a bit, not in musical energy, but simply in content; they seem somehow like slightly meandering, B-level songs that might've been cut if the album were longer. But track #13 brings the record to a satisfying conclusion. My Chemical Romance is a genuinely talented, skilled and honest band making an all-out attempt to deliver bold, artistic statements with each album; for this, I think they should be commended. Whether or not you like their music is entirely up to you, and I don't think a distaste for this type of adventurous stuff necessarily reflects badly upon the individual listener- just give MCR props for being artistically courageous
1	A REALLY REALLY!!! good album I'd first heard of Lupe Fiasco on a track off of Kanye West's album "Late Registration" called "Touch The Sky" i said to myself man this guys good. As 2006 rolls around I kept hearing his first single "Kick,Push" on the radio I knew I had to get this cd when it came out. When I opened it and first played it in my truck OH MAN it was like opening your first present on christmas day. I couldn't stop playing it from "Real" to "The Emporer's Soundtrack" and the track that makes you think of the special girl in your life "Daydreamin" featuring Jill Scott, this is album you should DEFIANTLY add to your collection.
1	Let me hear that again. This is generally regarded as Public Enemy's best album. It's easy to see why, because it does feature many of their best songs. Like "Bring the Noise", "Don't Believe the Hype" and "She Watch Channel Zero". Believe the hype
0	You eatin off hip hop and I hope you choke onthe gimmick!!!!!!!! When are we gonna start boycotting this bubble gum pop bull S%%T! Lil john is one of the worst emtertainers on this earth. His flow is rough and terrible and he wastes beats on a regular basis. I guess all of the zombies and sheep won't appreciate me dissing this retarded muppet but someone has to stand up and say something. This album is a just like a vicious string of herpes infecting the youth of many nations. We need some hip hop penicillin like KRS ONE, Mos Def, and kwel
1	An Open Book Loreena McKennitt's music will evoke other artists such as Enya and Kate Bush (when she's in full Celtic mode). McKennitt seems a bit more earnest in her seeker stance, and there's nothing wrong with that. It does probably mean that she may not reach everyone, especially those listeners who are less of a mystical bent. There is precious little irony or skepticism here, so it pretty much helps to be on the same spiritual page as the artist herself. Or at least to be able to temporarily to suspend your lack of belief. I did after a few listens, and I found myself coming back for more. New Age Music has its own kind of "hooks," and it is unlikely that once having heard the exotic arrangements here that you will be able to get them out of your head very easily. Her European hit "The Mummer's Dance" is particularly haunting. Unlike some of the reviewers below, I have to recommend this album with a few caveats. It may be hard for fans to realize that this really WON'T be everyone's cup of herbal tea. But then what is? Although I can think of one or two people I wouldn't bother playing this for, if you like your music Romantic (in the original sense of the word) and your lyrics appropriately diaphonous, well, you can't do better than Loreena McKennitt.
0	Stop trying so hard Brandon Cruz is trying to recapture something he never had. His credibility as an artist. Why else would he redo the songs written by Kyle instead of writing his own? Kyle toucher was the backbone of Dr. Know! I am utterly amazed at how Brandon can take truly amazing songs and butcher them beyond recognition.I recommend &quot;The Best of Dr. Know&quot; if you want to hear these songs as they were intended
0	Forever tacky? Contrary to the concert of praise surrounding Lang's virtuosity, these memories have little to do with music. Is fingerbreaking pace, music? The scherzo of Chopin third sonata says it all: it's all about how fast Lang can play, not at all about what Chopin's music means. The score -written by the decidely stubborn Chopin- doesn't acknowledge Lang's change of tempo: there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle. Once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype, marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats. I'll take the impetuous Argerich over this anytime: at least she is genuine. Her scherzo is organic, fluid. A recent CD by pianist Svetlana Ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as Lang is in the sun, she follows Chopin's score in a meaningful and sensitive way. Check the soundclip on her website [...], compare with others on amazon, listen!
1	The True King Of The South! Lil Wayne has truly developed and grown over the years and this cd is only a taste of what's to come.Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers in the industry right now.He's the best rapper out the south(behind Mac)!He has a unique flow and some really diverse lyricism.Tha Carter 2 is a instant classic and it was the best release of 2005 in the Hip-Hop/Rap category!Lil Wayne is on top of his game,as he released 5 solo albums,3 group albums,most recently a duo album with Baby and has a numerous amount of mixtapes.If you haven't cop this cd yet,then you are truly missing out on a great classic!Keep bringing that fiya music Weezy F Baby
1	Definitely a buy!!! One of 2005's odd gems, this is one of my favorite new bands. I can't really explain this album, just know that it is very strange and beautiful
0	seventy-one long minutes "Raw?" "Energetic"? "In your face"? I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things. Energy level is close to that of "The Trinity Sessions", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever. Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush. Coming soon to garage sales all over the country
1	4 stars Outkast has always been an unbelievably creative and experimental group. Arising from the south, which is typically plagued with no-talent wannabe-emcees who can't seem to keep their platinum teeth off each other's rectum, they manage to always provide conventional and beautiful music. Their dope debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was just a mere introduction to their skills, and would only pave the way for their untouchable classic known as ATLiens. On this superb sophomore LP, Outkast gave us an unbelievable grouping of introspective and thought-provoking music, with their own P-Funkish beats. Their experimentation only continued on their third album Aquemeni, which is yet another superb album. On this one, Big Boi and Andre 3000 experiment with some new sounds, go for some new creative subject matter, and slow down the tempo on a few notes. Their most recent album, 2000's Stankonia, showed how dynamic they were, giving us a mix of unbelievable, up-tempo party jams, feel-good music, and of course, the signature introspection. 2003 promised Outkast's return, and they indeed delivered. Firstly, Speakerboxx/The Love Below are two albums packaged as one. Speakerboxx is Big Boi's album, and The Love Below is Andre 3000's solo effort. Each member of Outkast basically star on each album and provide their own musical landscapes and styles. They each released a single, one per album, hence making this feel as if it is two different albums, and in fact it is. Therefore, for my review, i will review it as two separate albums, to keep the comparisons separate throughout the majority of the review until my conclusion. Keep in mind as you read the review, before i begin, that both albums are VERY DIFFERENT, and i will review this with an open mind and as a true fan of Outkast, which i am... enjoy... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Firstly, i will review Big Boi's album Speakerboxx. Big Boi's disk is loaded with the typical Outkast sound, keeping the experimentation level on a minimum. Big Boi has always been a dope lyricist, so i look forward to listening to this album with high hopes that he hasn't fallen off. The guest list looks pretty impressive, including some big mainstream names, and a couple of lesser known names. Still, Big Boi is the star, and he has proven in the past that he can carry the mantle. Let's hope that the same applies here. Track List & Rating: "Speakerboxx" 1 - Intro (NOT RATED) 2 - GhettoMusick (3 1/2 Stars) 3 - Unhappy (3 Stars) 4 - Bowtie f/ Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha (4 Stars) 5 - The Way You Move f/ Sleepy Brown (4 1/2 Stars) 6 - The Rooster (3 Stars) 7 - Bust f/ Killer Mike (4 Stars) 8 - War (4 Stars) 9 - Church (3 1/2 Stars) 10 - Bamboo (Interlude) (NOT RATED) 11 - Tomb Of The Boom f/ Konkrete, Big Gipp & Ludacris (4 Stars) 12 - E-Mac (Interlude) (NOT RATED) 13 - Knowing (4 Stars) 14 - Flip Flop Rock f/ Killer Mike & Jay-Z (4 1/2 Stars) 15 - Interlude (NOT RATED) 16 - Reset f/ Khujo Goodie & Cee-Lo (5 Stars) 17 - D-Boi (Interlude) (NOT RATED) 18 - Last Call f/ Slimm Calhoun, Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz & Mello (3 1/2 Stars) 19 - Bowtie (Postlude) (NOT RATED) Big Boi's half of this double album, known as Speakerboxx kicks off with a skippable intro, which then leads us into "GhettoMusick". The synthesized beat immediately kicks in, making you think that it would be some sort of up-tempo techno track. After a bit of the beat playing, we get some quick, danceable, party music and Big Boi kicking off a flow. The sound of the song is fast and smooth, perfect for those long high-way drives. Big Boi sings for the first part, and raps for the latter part. I like to consider this an introductory track, experimenting with techno, R&B, and hip-hop elements. As a sidenote, id like to say that i am a huge fan of experimental music. I love it, which is why i enjoyed the most recent experimental musical albums such as Phrenology by the Roots and Electric Circus by Common. When classic, well-respected artists decide to cross into new styles of music, its always interesting and fun to me, and those with an open-mind. "Bowtie" features the southern, P-funkish elements which make Outkast who they are. Featuring some slamming trumpets, that typical Dungeon Family singing, and some nice guitars, Big Boi drops some pretty dope lyrics about a certain female who can't seem to get off his mind. The track might seem a bit commercial, but its a pleasure to listen to due to the lyricism of Big Boi and the dope production done by Jazze Pha (who is typically a commercial producer, but has his moments). Big Boi proves on this track that he is indeed still a dope rapper, and has yet to fall off. "The Way You Move" is Big Boi's lead single. Big Boi's unbelievably creative lyrics adds some nostalgia, taking us back to the groups' extraordinarily light-hearted work found on Aquemeni. The production is one of those pieces that will be stuck in your head for ages to come, with its pounding trumpets. The background R&B/soul vocals only add to the song, giving the song an unforgettable, seductive feeling to it. Big Boi's mic presence is unforgettable, and this is an ideal lead single for Big Boi. Killer Mike joins Big Boi on "Bust". The melodic production is dope, and the background vocals are reminiscent of some of the silly singing found on D-12's debut Devil's Night. Killer Mike and Big Boi drop ill introspective verses, reminiscing about the past. The production is, as expected, loud and pounding, but also melodic and listenable. Immediately with the first listen, you can tell this is an Outkast track, and a damn good one at that. "Church" has the incredible makings of a classic, but is shut down by seemingly annoying and overabusive production. The subject matter revolves around Big Boi questioning his religion due to the problems surrounding not only himself, but the entire world. Big Boi mixes introspection with some creativity and heart, backed by some thought-provoking lyrics. Lyrically and Subject-Matter-wise, this track is dope, but the production and organization needs a lot of work. As i said earlier, youve got to have an open musical mind and be a fan of true hip-hop lyricism and elements in order to fully appreciate the experimental sounds found on Speakerboxx. Skipping ahead we arrive at "Flip Flop Rock". A commercial Jay-Z joins Killer Mike and Big Boi on this dope introspective collaborative crew joint. Big Boi touches on street violence, racism, and oppression that is seemingly killing the blacks of this country, as well as the other kids in the streets. Big Boi's introspective lyrics and political views are interesting, and add a new twist to those who doubted how ill of an emcee he is. The melodic hook is one of those dope ones, but soon Jay-Z appears on the track and gives us some egotistical, somewhat materialistic lyrics. I dont understand all of the hype over Jay-Z's Black Album due to the fact that Jay-Z is nowhere near showing me that he is going to change, and turn underground again. His verse on this song is very commercial, and leads me to believe that his so-called "final" album might just be a repeat of other washouts he's had in the past. I sure hope not... because the heads deserve a LOT more. Its interesting that the Dungeon Family themselves provide the first true classic on Speakerboxx, that being "Reset". Cee-Lo and Khujo Goodie from Goodie Mob join up with Big Boi to give us the dopest song on Big Boi's disc. The slow-tempo production and haunting background vocals provide an amazing atmosphere, and a somewhat nostalgic trip back to the days of the classic ATLiens, where Outkast gave us a classic-filled album of this caliber. Big Boi, Cee-Lo and Khujo drop some memorably DOPE introspective verses, touches on the evils of the world from government, to racists, to life itself. The overall feel of the track is unbelievable, as it is a true classic. Speakerboxx is nowhere near being as good as any of the previous Outkast albums by themselves. Its obvious to me that Big Boi fits a LOT better with Andre 3000 than without him. This album, unlike his partner's disc, stays true to hip-hop and retains the traditional Outkast sound for most of the tracks, along with a few new soundscapes and experimental sounds. This album incorporates lots of guests, but the majority do a great job and manage to keep up with Big Boi. A lot of the songs are bangers, and it stays at a great level of quality, but nowhere near the classics that they have put out in the past. However, Speakerboxx is a pretty dope stand-alone album with its share of hits and misses. 3.75 Stars ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moving On, we now arrive to Andre 3000's somewhat solo effort, known as The Love Below. This is about as farfetched as Andre has ever gone in his career. Experimentation and Eclectic music is the name of the game here, as Andre gives us some unique musical landscapes, touching on every single musical style thinkable, from jazz, to soul, to R&B, to hip-hop, to rock, and beyond. As i said at the beginning of this review, i am a huge fan of experimentation by artists who have already proven themselves, thus i fully respect Andre's decision to explore his creativity as he has done on The Love Below. Staying true to hip-hop is something that i treasure, but Andre has proven in the past that he is capable of doing that, so i will review this album on a completely unbiased level. Track List & Rating: "The Love Below" 1 - The Love Below (Intro) (NOT RATED) 2 - Love Hater (4 Stars) 3 - God (Interlude) (NOT RATED) 4 - Happy Valentine's Day (4 Stars) 5 - Spread (3 1/2 Stars) 6 - Where Are My Panties? (NOT RATED) 7 - Prototype (4 Stars) 8 - She Lives In My Lap f/ Rosario Dawson (4 1/2 Stars) 9 - Hey Ya! (4 Stars) 10 - Roses f/ Big Boi (4 1/2 Stars) 11 - Good Day, Good Sir (NOT RATED) 12 - Behold A Lady (4 Stars) 13 - Pink & Blue (2 Stars) 14 - Love In War (3 Stars) 15 - She's Alive (4 Stars) 16 - Dracula's Wedding f/ Kelis (3 Stars) 17 - My Favorite Things (NOT RATED) 18 - Take Off Your Cool f/ Norah Jones (3 Stars) 19 - Vibrate (3 Stars) 20 - A Life In The Day Of Benjamin Andre (5 Stars) "The Love Hater" kicks off The Love Below with some already ecleptic music. The song captures an unbelievable early decade style of mo-town jazz, which im sure older musical fans will be thrilled to listen to. The piano melodies and trumpets give the song a very Tom Jones-like feel, where singing was the main operative. Of course, Andre 3000 isn't just an ordinary artist, and i consider him one of the true innovators of not just hip-hop music, but all sorts of musical styles. Fans of the traditional Outkast style might shun at this, but for once, listen to Big D: It helps to have an open mind. The album continues with "Happy Valentine's Day". Kicking off with a thumping bass kick, drums, and claps, we immediately get some funky guitars. Immediately you know that Andre decides to experiment with a funkish style of music on this track, with a tiny ounce of R&B and Soul. Andre's singing talent is off the charts, and i truly believe his skills are largely underrated. The background singing vocals give the song a unique, early 70s soul feel, with some funk. When it comes to subject matter, Andre stresses the importance of "Valentine's Day" and how love makes the world go round. Forget your typical rapping here, Andre once again sings, and does a damn good job of it. Andre 3000 goes to pure R&B/Soul with "Prototype". The song title doesn't exactly sound like it would be a love song, but it is. Throughout the majority of the song, we have a nice soulful vocal display by Andre, along with background synthesizers, guitars, and pianos to add to the mood. The slow-tempo feel of the song gives it a relaxing atmosphere as Andre shows off once again his vocal skills. "She Lives In My Lap" is an unbelievable display of honesty, even though its not exactly the same opinion that I have. Andre deals with the fact that he seemingly cannot stay in a relationship because of the mere fact that he keeps females and enjoys their company hoping to get into their pants. The subject matter is honest, yet shallow due to the fact that Andre can be easily critiqued for not giving a f*ck about a women unless she f*cks him. He admits it on an honest level, and behind an unbelievable mix of vocals and production. However, i wonder if he was actually telling the truth, or if he just wanted a little bit of controversy and/or needed a song idea. Who knows? Up next is Andre 3000's lead single, entitled "Hey Ya". The fast tempo, guitarish beat giving the track an amazing light-hearted feel. However, besides the excellent, fast tempo production, Andre 3000 spits fire with his amazing vocal display. The song has a very mid 50's sort of quirky feel to it, making it one of those songs that many heads are afraid to admit they enjoy. Me? I love it. The beat is tight, the singing is amazing, and its difficult for you not to enjoy this melodic musical medley. I feel as if Andre chose the perfect lead single, just like i felt Big Boi did on his album. "Roses" and "Behold a Lady" are eerily similar love songs. Both songs feature some seductive, R&B/soul vocals directed to a woman. Keeping the familiar Outkast P-Funk, mixed with new forms of music and nice melodies is something that Andre has seemingly perfected the art of doing this merger. The second track of the two is a much more up-tempo track, with a tiny bit more seductiveness to it, and some more appeal. The synthesized melody is different than the last, proving that the only familiar parts would be the seductiveness of the vocals and Andre's choice of subject matter. The Love Below hits a speed bump with "Pink & Blue". I appreciate the elceptiveness of the album, as long as it makes sense. What we have here is a cadre of sounds put together in a fast pace, making the song sound like a complete mess, and almost unlistenable. Thusfar, this is the only extremely weak moment on either album. Skipping ahead past some of the average moments of The Love Below, we get to the closing track, strangely titled "A Life In The Day Of Benjamin Andre". Believe it or not, Andre does something on this track which he has yet to do... and thats RAP!!!! Unbelievably enough, Andre ends his disc with what brought him to the fame in the first place. Production-wise, its pretty simplistic, with drums, a clap, and some weird background effects. This song feels a lot like something that was pulled from ATLiens, due to its simple production and song concept. The subject matter is creative as f*ck, as Andre uses his "art of storytelling" to summarize his entire life into one day. The song has no catchy hook of any sort, but that doesn't matter due to the fact that Andre gets personal, even touching on his relationship with Erykah Badu. A fitting close to Andre's disc. The Love Below is eclectic, unique, and at times just plain bizarre, but its primarily good. The musical variety is shown, and Andre's maturity and growth as an artist is something to give praise about. His disc is filled with mainly good or great songs, and pretty much only one flaw. Old-school Outkast fans probably wont dig it too much unless they have an open mind, and most likely neither will backpacker heads. However, i truly believe that this is an album not only for hip-hop fans, but for fans of all music respectfully. 4 Stars ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In listening to Speakerboxx/The Love Below as a combined album, i often wondered if Big Boi and Andre 3000 could really separate and keep apart without losing a tad bit of the quality. I mean, lets be honest, they are an unbelievable duo and their different points of view as well as rhyme styles create a wonderful landscape of lyricism and music. Apparently, they indeed prove that they can. I honestly had no clue what to expect from this album except that i honestly trust Outkast to give us good music, and im glad i did. I always walk into an Outkast album with an open mind set, and i always walk out with a smile knowing that they have yet to make a bad album. The question on many fans minds is: which album is better? Well, in my own personal opinion, Andre 3000's album is slightly better and much more consistent this time around, and the music is unbelievable. However, Big Boi's album is much more true to hip-hop with lyricism and such. My conclusion to this is that i highly appreciate that Outkast gave us 2 discs this time around, but i believe that they belong together in order to give us the true classics which they are more than capable of. Their experimentation is great, and this album will always be treasured by their fans, but i do believe that their part should only be temporary. It was dope how its 2 discs for the price of one, and thats even MORE the reason for me to reccomend Speakerboxx/The Love Below. It is a dope album loaded with stuff to please everybody... so get yourself a copy as soon as you can. Overall Rating: 4 Stars
1	great album I don't really write reviews but I wanted to throw in here that this is a great album, because there are so few reviews of it. If you liked his first you will like this to; I don't find either one any better or worse. Also, watching that video they've got on this amazon page, he seems to be pretty great live. But really, there's not much else to say: If you liked his first, you won't be disappointed by this one.
1	Pretty good selection of songs Wow - this cd set has it all! I particulary like the 4th cd and play it all the time for my 3 month old. You'll definitely enjoy hours upon hours of kiddie music
0	Baaa baaa, music for sheep (0 stars) Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity.
1	With deeper listens... ....I have found that Incubus' masterpiece "Make Yourself" is much more of an obscure Progressive Metal album than a Nu-Metal album. Take some deep listens into this album, and you will see that the musical progression of each song fits perfectly into the moniker of Progressive Metal,with a lot of funk, Hip Hop and Nu-Metal tossed into the mix. Each song progresses with perfection and every note played is placed in just right. Even Brandon Boyd's amazing vocals are progressive, as is the concept of the album, which is making yourself out of your own ideas, thoughts and beliefs, not letting the Government, Authorities and the world shape what you believe and feel. The guitar riffs are intricate and amazing, as is the funky bass lines and the tight drumming. The DJ adds much atmosphere and ambience to the record as well. Brandon's vocals are superb, having a wide range and deep metaphoric lyricism. I took this album for granted ever since I first picked it up, but in the new perception that I am in now, I appreciate it much more. I feel that it takes time for the true goodies hidden in the compositions of this album to come to the surface, and a face value listen won't reveal anything beyond a great "Nu-Metal/Rock/Funk" record. I think this is Incubus at their finest(which many would argue with, citing "Science" as their best. True, I feel that Science is amazing as well and shows elements of Progression, but its "Make Yourself" where they reach their pinnacle). Do yourself a favor and pick this album up, if you can get past the whole Nu-Metal Stigma, you will find a true gem that is worth many repeated listens
1	Nina Persson and friends Nina Persson's "debut solo album" (as described on the promo sticker) began life in Sweden in 1998, the same year as the Cardigans' Gran Turismo. It was completed in America throughout 2000 with producer Mark Linkous from the excellent Sparklehorse, during time off from the Cardigans, which had clearly taken on a life of its own, not entirely of her choosing. A Camp was born in 1997 after a meeting with Niclas Frisk, who co-wrote most of the songs and plays on several of them. Boyfriend Nathan Larson (from Shudder To Think) also plays on all but one of the tracks and co-wrote the opening song. Frequent Flyer sets the mood of the album as it opens with eerie samples, theremin sounds, thuddy drums and Nina's gorgeously bittersweet vocals over an engaging melody. In fact the tunes retain a high standard throughout and the quirky production (though mainstream by Sparklehorse standards) is never less than complementary and interesting. Angel Of Sadness is a stand-out song although I Can Buy You made a first class single. Although the album consists mostly of original material, a few stray covers shoe-horn their way in - the Replacements' Rock 'n' Roll Ghost; bizarrely, Restless Heart's old US hit The Bluest Eyes In Texas; and Walking The Cow, one of the best known songs of cult singer Daniel Johnston, whose 2003 album Fear Yourself was also produced by Mark Linkous. A Camp manages the delicate trick of being unmistakably, instantly belonging to Nina Persson whilst at the same time being quite distinct from the Cardigans. May her future projects be as successfu
1	Pure form of Art I've been a fan of the Cardigans ever since their first CD release in USA and when i've heard that some band members were doing solo I was very anxious to hear them. I think that Nina's CD is art in its purest form. Each song is carefully put together like a collage to form a trully unique piece. I found my self experiencing different moods as I listened to each of the songs. Some other very good songs were actually not released on this cd. Songs such as &quot;Charlie Charle&quot;, &quot;My Misery is my Mystery&quot;, and &quot;What the hell are you crying for?&quot; but dont worry you can still hear these songs. For those of you who don't know Nina has a special website for her CD its : http://www.acamp.cjb.net/. There she has an option of listening the unreleased songs. I hope this review has helped you in some way
0	More Carpetbagger BS Wow, another buncha poetry school dropout pouting girls clutching "banjers" and "gitars" wearing old dresses and ripping off Appalachian and southern culture while the ripping off is good. Tune in next year and the BGTs will be putting out a Calypso record. Another one for the "No Depression" poop pile
0	Not What I Wanted The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either. The primary reason for buying this CD was the song "You Are My Sister", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing
0	Thom's Tourettes Ok first off I love radiohead -pablo honey up through the electronic swarms of Kid A, as well as the avant-garde Amnesiac. So I guess I am confused why I DONT like this... it's boring? it's like white bread, flat and blah... and with no real substance? Thom isn't covering any new territory here lyrically, or melodically. The electronics don't supplement his voice either... each song opens with inessential spastic ticking of naked techno beats...then a layer more or two before Thom chimes in with a droning melody that sounds like he's dragging his feet over routine tones. I'm left understimulated and quite unimpressed. I even question Thom's concept of quality... Surely he knew that this was subpar... nevertheless it was packaged, shipped and is displayed on shelves at the right eye level to lure dollars- all because of name recognition. We learned our lesson with George W. Bush, let's not relive it in the vein of cult music. If only I had an Eraser, that I could wipe this disappointment from my memory
0	very disappointing I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad.
1	A must have for your child I can't believe someone would not enjoy this CD. My 2 kids ( ages 1 and 2 1/2) love this CD. Sometimes it is the only thing that will keep them happy. I will admit, if you are new to Laurie Berkner, it seems a little boring at first. But, after listening to it a couple of times, it is incredible. the words are so easy to learn and the tunes are catchy. I don't even mind if they are trapped in my head all day (unlike the other kid songs we have). We also have We Are the Dinosaurs, and love that one, too. I can't wait to get Laurie's other 2 CDs. I tell everyone about Laurie Berkner, she is a true gem
0	What is this? We all have different taste and I am trying to consider this. But to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life. Nickelodeon and even the Disney channel featuring him. My little girl and I listened to two songs that they played on the Disney channel over and over.Malti is the song she really started to listen to. Honestly. The only reason why that song is so great is Barbara's voice and singing ability. Dave can't sing and shouldn't even try to sing in Spanish. The tune is catchy and we find us humming along. SO I ordered this CD. What a joke. Most of the time you can't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs. He has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it. But it is not entertaining for little ones.My daughter keeps asking: What is this? Till Malti comes on and then she and I are relieved and hum along with joy and glee. Thank you Barbara for saving this song. I even bought another CD thinking perhaps I just got a bad one and the next are better. I am disappointed with that one as well. So you take a song like Somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it. Wopee. I like it but it isn't worth it to me and I admit I have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly.. he is overrated and sold. There is a song with Cheryl Crow on it. Okay. SO I am thinking this will be fun perhaps. Only to find that I want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song. I guess I am not a alternative and don't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music. I want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children. This type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time. My children have NO clue what this is about and can't figure it out. And we listen to everything from Disney to Classic, to Broadway. YOu name it. So we are not just Sesame Street CD lovers. But this music is a joke. No talent. ONE tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing. Barbar saves this CD but what a waste of money for ONE song. DON"T BUY IT. And all these people who fall for it.. grrrr. It is like a art gallerie. Everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot. And they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is. And in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it. Give me a break. Shame on Disney and Nickelodeon to fall into this as well. And taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity. WOw, guess you can tell I am not into it. ;0( Explore, again.. everyone has different taste. But I just don't get it, nor like it. I find it horrible.
1	holy whack! this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell.
0	what were they thinking? I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that
1	the escalator the escalator and the man stand at the bottom summed up the album even before i had the pleasure of listening to such beauty and intelligence in my entire life time of listening to folk rock music this has affected me the most i can't tell how much.. i know it's an clinche but.it left me speechless i didn't know whether to cry jump up and down with merriment of..just sit quietly and seep in the beauty i had just been laid next too me. all them emotions from a voice guitar and a trumpet at the end of broken arrows how do you say can that happen? because this guy has talent. to transmit an beauty and vibrance over to the listeners ears in my mind you have to be in tune with yourself to fully appreciate the album. we all have these emotions in us to appreciate this album on another level and i have and i won't be turning back it changed my life this afternoon.. the escalator only goes up..
0	Awful, Awful,Awful One great ballad, Evermore Without You, doth not a musical make. That song is stunning, slightly pedestrian lyrics not withstanding. The rest of the show is simply dreadful. Some is downright irritating." A secret, a secret.....", that line plays on the nerves like a rat gnawing on the fingernails. Horrible. I have a secret, stay away from this ridiculous mess. The plot is ludicrous, and the performances dull. They all sing it like they know how awful it is. And Michael Crawford has reached a new low in his mediocre career. Hopefully someone like Barbara Cook or John Barrowman will record Evermore Without You, so the world can appreciatte it without having to go near this embarrassing trash. Sir Andrew, c'mon, surely you can come up with something better than this
0	Mediocre Rapper Takes Over The World! First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes. He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like "Who Cares?" But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's "Nothing Left To Lose." The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself
0	Hideous Arrangments !!! - Stay clear. 1 of Dylan's Worst !!! I'm a huge dylan fan - and collector (I have around 120 or so of his albums, bootlegs, shows etc.). This is one of his worst ever - if not The worst - the only redeeming feature - the singing is not bad - even good on afew tracks. Docendo Discimus is dead right - spot on criticism - I could/t have said it better myself - so I won't try. anyone, IMH, who gives this album more than 3 stars is of his rocker..
0	And People Buy This? One of the most ridiculous pieces of minimalist trash out there. It just goes to show you where a lot of time, a lot of money, popular culture, and a twisted world view have landed so much of American. Don't waste your time or your money on this.
0	To be honest... Not the best score I've ever heard. Certainly not bad, some tracks were very nice. Unfortunately, a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking, or simply boring. The best piece of music from the film, the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene (best part of the movie!), is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc. I don't doubt Howard's talent as a composer, but the music for King Kong, sadly, doesn't have the same bite as the movie.
1	Adds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle The first Band box-set, "Across the Great Divide," was a disappointing ripoff, so this is long overdue. And it's also worth the wait! Others have criticized this set for having nothing completists won't already have. I disagree. I've been a serious Band fan for about a decade, and there are rarities on here that I'd never even heard of until now. So for all but the hardest of hardcore fans, this is a welcome surprise. Not perfect, but close enough. If the accompanying book is correct, even the Band members themselves had forgotten about a couple of the previously unreleased tracks. As for the rest of us, if there's a mid-60s recording you've heard of but never heard up to now, chances are it's here. The 1964 single "Uh Uh Uh"/"Leave Me Alone" - which was considered "lost" a few years ago - is here, and it sounds terrific. All three of the 1965 Atco sides are here (only one, "He Don't Love You," was previously available on CD). The studio recording of their cover of Bobby Blue Bland's "Honky Tonk" was an especially nice surprise for me; I'd heard an extremely low-fi live recording of it before but didn't know they'd ever officially recorded it. There are a few surprises among their better-known work as well, notably the newly restored coda in "To Kingdom Come." What is less satisfying is the selection of previously released tracks. I know no box set is ever going to satisfy all of a given act's fans, but the previously-released portion of this set seems particularly haphazard, especially the recordings with Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. Where is "High Blood Pressure," the only Hawkins single on which Robbie, Levon, Rick, Richard and Garth all played? What about the myriad still-unreleased Basement Tapes that are rumored to exist? (There are a few new releases from those sessions here, including a great early version of "Caledonia Mission," but if the rumors are true it's still a drop in the bucket.) And why does every Band best-of have to include the supremely overrated "It Makes No Difference" and omit the beautiful "Hobo Jungle"? Minor complaints, I concede, especially since anyone who likes the Band well enough to shell out for this collection will probably also have most or all of their original albums anyhow. The DVD is a great addition as well, particularly the Saturday Night Live performances from just a few weeks before The Last Waltz. Seeing the guys play together at that late date is almost surreal for those of us who know, er, the shape they were in, if you will. If you want everything, this will get you close to it, at least
1	Laid Back EC, Living and Loving in South Florida I have to confess that, while I love Clapton, his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair. And I can't say I am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately. For me I enjoy his work with Cream, his guest work, his first few albums, the one he recorded with The Band, a few older live albums, and bits of the Phil Collins-produced record in the early 80s. After that it's a fall-off, but I am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years. I have been listening to 461 a lot lately. It holds up exceedingly well. The groove is laid-back, with solid musicianship and expert song selection. It makes for great road music, especially "Willie and the Hand Jive," "I Shot the Sheriff," and the classic closer, "Mainline Florida." The ballads are beautiful, too. There is not a weak track on the album. There is a consistent tone, an aversion to excess and a concentration on the note and harmonic "fit" that makes this album an overall winner in EC's catalog. As someone who used to party in EC's old house at 461 Ocean Boulevard in Golden Beach in the early 80s, let me say -- you did it (and us) proud
0	Sour Cream 32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad.
1	Ahhhhhhhh refreshing Like crackin open a cold beer. This is hip hop ya'll. This what needs to be on the airwaves. This whole album is listenable. No poppy fluff here. Just a dope MC paintin pictures with words and not videos. How dudes like JOC D4L and franchize boys sell records is still beyond me. Support real hip hop and buy this. You wont regret it
1	A very Good Debut album Sheryl Crow has become one of my favorite artists. Several of my favorite songs appear on this album. Run, Baby Run opens the album in good form. Leaving Las Vegas is next. Strong Enough is probably my favorite song by Sheryl ever. I love the acoustic guitar. All I Wanna Do turned out to be a major hit for her and probably launched the career. I Shall Believe is another great song. This is a must for any fan of Sheryl Crows
0	I think he needs a pad and a pen. As another person mentioned, I am no where near a bow bow hater. I remember feeling some type of way about liking him when he was younger because I seldom dig commercial rap. So now he's all grown up and doing his thing. He had a couple of hits. One day I'm online reading about this guy hating on Will Smith and I later learned that this guy doesn't even write his own music. WHAT?! Are you kidding me. No matter who the remarks was to, one cannot disrespect another rapper when they don't even write their own music. After hearing that I was just done. How can you rate his music when he is not writing it? What are we rating his sound over the music because he has no connection with it. I think it was just ok. "Fresh as I am" was hot. I was really feeling that sound. I like ok, he's all grown up and showing people what he is made up but again later I learned he didn't write it....lol..that'f funny. Is this how Jermain Dupri feels? Can the real rapper please stand up
0	give me a break Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, "wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good." Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified. Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes. However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke
1	IT'S BEEN WELL OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I I HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME OUT IN 1973, AND ITS' STILL AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS BACK THEN. WOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY ARE A LOT OF REVIEWS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RECORD.IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM, IT'S NOT QUITE JAZZ, IT'S NOT QUITE "FUNK", IT'S NOT QUITE "FUSION" MUSIC, IT STANDS ON ITS' OWN AS SOMETHING ELSE. KIND OF A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE. AT THE TIME, KEYBOARD INNOVATIONS WERE REALLY COMING INTO VOGUE AND HERBIE REALLY KNEW HOW TO EXPLOIT IT ON THIS ALBUM. BETTER THAN HIS LATER ELECTRONIC STUFF, WHICH WAS A LOT MORE COMMERCIAL. OTHER CONTEMPORARIES FROM THIS TIME INCLUDE CHICK COREA, JAN HAMMER, GEORGE DUKE, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, STEVIE WONDER.
1	A very good collection..more than just the 4 singles Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to "Cooleyhighharmony", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group. HIGHLIGHTS: This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before "Khalil") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half. Part 1 has "Thank You" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. "Vibin'" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). "I Sit Away" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and "Nobody Knows"..is Rich clinically depressed or what?) In the "slow side", Babyface's "I'll Make Love to you" set a record for the length of time at #1. "On Bended Knee" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and "Water Runs Dry" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic "Yesterday" and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition. LOWS: "All Around the World" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's "Travelin' Man" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, "Khalil" is a pretty blah track. "Jezzebel" is a dull overlong affair. "50 Candles" includes the lyric "Holding your body like a plastic molding"....'nuff said. BOTTOM LINE: There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like "I Sit By" and "Yesterday" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans
1	When R&B was something special With the founding father of R&B groups New Edition doing the solo thing in the early nineties and Boyz II Men still a year or so away, Troop was the premire R&B group of 1990. The songs Spread My Wings, All I Do Is Think Of You and I Will Always Love are some of the best songs to come out of early 90's R&B and the boys earned their spot in R&B in my opinion
0	DISSAPOINTING HE SOULD KEEP WRITING RYMES FOR OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE RBX AND THE WORK HE DOES WITH OTHERS BUT ON HIS OWN NOT SO GOO
1	Fantastic CD Michael Buble is phenomenal. Song number 5 HOME is a choker-upper at our houses, but we all love it and sing it out loud. Right now our family is separated by miles - but not for too much longer - the CD has tremendous sentimental value in our homes already and we will still be singing it I'm sure when we are all reunited again
1	Awesome Soundtrack! The National Treasure soundtrack is one of my favorites. It's up-beat, and fast-paced, and very energetic. It has an interesting mix of orchestral, techno, and rock music - put together in a very creative way. It doesn't have many of those moments of miscillaneous chords wandering around everywhere like alot of soundtracks I've heard do. The only thing is that there are only a few themes and they are repeated a lot. So, listening to it TO much may get you tired of those themes pretty quickly. Other than that, I've REALLY enjoyed listening to it - and I highly reccommend it
0	The Trouble With Tributes The trouble with all-star tribute albums to past superstar artists and bands is that oftentimes they are done purely for money, attention, and a sense that certain of those artists can one-up the artists being paid the "tribute" to; and often, the results don't come close to measuring up to the originals. Such, I'm afraid, is the case with the 1993 COMMON THREADS album, where Nashville artists give their props to that renegade bunch of desperados who occupied the Hotel California for most of the 1970s, the Eagles. The brainchild of Eagles manager Irving Azoff, who saw how revered the band had become amongst the Nashville hierarchy of the Nineties, COMMON THREADS also functioned as a charity album, whose profits went to the Walden Woods Project, of which Eagles drummer Don Henley was a particularly prominent supporter. Were it not for that one particular aspect, COMMON THREADS would be as much an aberration as a lot of other tribute albums of its type. Even as this album already stands, however, and even though it caused hell to freeze over and the Eagles to reunite, the artists here still fall well short of what the band originally did. What seems to have happened here is that each of the artists got so caught up in the idea of doing songs from the Eagles' massively successful catalog that they thought they could get off by copying almost note-for-note and by arrangement what the band had done; one listen to Travis Tritt's version of "Take It Easy", and Vince Gill's take on "I Can't Tell You Why" seems to indicate this. In other cases, they sound terribly anemic, as in Clint Black's version of "Desperado", where he sounds like second-rate John Denver (and I think John Denver could have done this far better than Clint Black). And hearing faux-Eagles wanna-bes like Little Texas doing "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and Diamond Rio doing "Lyin' Eyes" is no substitute whatsoever for the real thing. The womenfolk don't have it much easier either. Lorrie Morgan simply sounds out of place on "The Sad Cafe", seemingly not having any idea about the song's mournful inspiration; and Tanya Tucker's toughness on "Already Gone" is quite dull. Suzy Bogguss' take on "Take It To The Limit" is a bit better, but it won't make anyone forget the Randy Meisner-led original. And Trisha Yearwood's version of "New Kid In Town" is okay, but she sounds like she's trying to do it the way she thinks her idol Linda Ronstadt would, and it's not totally successful either. In the end, the inability of contemporary Nashville artists to really understand the Eagles lies in the fact that there is a very wide gap between the Eagles' sound of the 1970s and the way contemporary Music Row does things. Though classified as "country-rock", the Eagles also mixed in elements of bluegrass, surf-rock, R&B, disco, and even Tex-Mex a time or two, styles that are largely alien to contemporary Nashville. As Linda herself, around whom the Eagles originally formed in 1971, has said, it is a part of the diverse spectrum of California music: "California music is a real hybrid, very specialized, and it doesn't have anything to do with Nashville." This is something that I'm not sure these artists really understand, and why I can't give this album a better rating
0	He's not quite there yet... Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!
0	Scraping the bottom of the barrel As if Toxicity wasnt mediocre enough, this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it. Where do we place the blame? Is it Darons poor songwriting skills? Or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible MTV-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up? Or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and TV? Whichever one you choose, this is not the SOAD we all love, this is an unoriginal rehash of Toxicity. Oh wow, they have an anti-government song? So what, who hasnt made one of those. And anti-war songs? Travel back to the 60s, they were chock full full of them. Everything I hear is uninspired and downright lazy. Its also unfortunate that Serj got sidelined by Daron "I wish I had talent" Malakian, for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs, while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have ADHD in your classroom that are just seriously not funny. Maybe im being to harsh, but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-Toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure, and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics. You want to get good music, get SOAD's self titled, its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as MTV.
1	Awesome Instrumental!!! I have been addicted to this CD for months. I heard one of the songs on the NEW AGE satellite channel and thought I'd give the CD a chance. The entire CD is awesome. The music reminds me of Enigma, Deep Forest, and Medicine Woman (except no fruity bird sounds). Sure enough, as I checked out some stuff about Kevin Wood, it said his influences were: Enya, Patrick O'Hearn, Deep Forest, Sacred Spirit, Enigma, and George Winston. If you like the sounds of those musicians, you'll love this CD. The piano pieces are exceptional and every song has a good rhythm/beat. If you take a chance, ENJOY
1	if not for us eccentric music fans it would be totally forgotten What a shame. Such a good debut album yet no one even knows who they are. Jay Ferguson is one of the luckiest or most talented artists. He achieved success in 3 forms (Spirit, Jo Jo and Thunder Island solo). This is a great, gritty, greasy, soulful southern rock album. I would like to see a modern band do a cover so as to resurrect this quality band. How about Metalica doing Run, run run?
1	A Happy Sacrifice I gladly sacrificed two of the four speakers in my car to this wonderful, wonderful treasure. What more can I say
1	I Wish Dylan Were Young Today My favorite song on this record is "Subterranean Homesick Blues." I keep picturing that video in my mind of a very young Bob Dylan, flipping those cards to the beat of this song. "115th Dream" is another song with those great lyrics that only Dylan can write. He is certainly a poet, there is no denying that. I Love it's Alright, Ma." But every time I hear the version on this early record, my ears subconsciously hear all the the applause that you hear erupting during the live version on "Before the Flood" when Dylan shouts out, "Sometimes even the President of the United States must have to stand naked." That song worked then. It works now. We need a young troubador to help us find our way in these troubled times. But, I suppose nobody listened then, so I guess they wouldn't listen now. Still, I'd like a young Dylan today raging against all the injustice that abounds
1	TALENTED I'M FROM FLORIDA AND DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THAT MUCH TALENT HERE. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I BOUGHT A ALBUM THAT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD SPENT 15 TO 20 DOLLARS TO HERE 1 SONG THAT I LIKED. I ROCKED T-PAIN'S ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END. RAPPA TERNT SANGA PROVES THE U DON'T HAVE TO STEAL, KILL, SELL DRUGS, HAVE SEX, OR BE THUGED OUT IN EVER SONG TO INTEREST PEOPLE. . .
0	Probably the most stimulating relaxation CD I've ever heard Points for the concept, but this CD kept me awake! The crashing waves are loud and distracting, even on low volume, and the music frankly a little depressing. I actually found myself getting agitated listening to it. Then again, I had some of the worst nights' sleep ever during a vacation in Belize in which I camped on the beach for a week. Oddly enough, Gibson's Ocean Sounds works better for me, probably because there the waves are gently washing up on shore rather than smacking into rocks. If you are used to ocean sounds then Natural Sleep Inducement may work for you, but if you're landlocked like me you may not find it as helpful
0	I'll give it half a star... this CD Deserves 1/2 a Star Because i did enjoy whipping it out the window of my car into a nearby bicyclist....It was pretty funny. Otherwise this record was worthless
1	Funk Is on the Rise! I have been reading some of the reviews online for this CD and I am wondering for the P-Funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect? I like this double CD because George was going for the old & new sound of today's overproduced and water down sound.The songs I really liked were "Bounce 2 This" a funk jam for the ages,"Inhale Slow","Never Ending Love","Su,Su,Su","Something Stank","Viagra","Paradigm","Gyspy Woman","Whole Lotta Shakin",and "Goodnight Sweetheart,Goodnight".There were some songs I didn't care for songs like "I Can Dance" which went on for too long and "Butt-a-Butt".I wish Mr. Clinton would brought some of his trademark characters to this CD:Sir Nose,Starchild,Dr.Funkenstein,the monkey,The Horny Horns,etc.In short,this is a very good album better than the pervious P-Funk albums in the 90's.This CD is a good start
1	Reviews less than 5 just don't get it... Ever walk around, read the newspaper, watch TV, and basically see so mch stupid stuff that it takes all your willpower not to go off and bash everything? Thankfully, Black doesn't care whose feelings get hurt, so we're all benefitting from it. Hilarious stuff, man..
0	sick boy? is this a cover of Social D's sick boy? and if youre looking for a good album, get one of theirs
0	At Last was disappointment Turns out I purchased this cd for one song. I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd. The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd
1	SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGIN' If you've never bought a Country CD in your life, Make this your first. It is haunting. I defy anyone to play this just once. I always repeat it at least 3 times. The Man is the most potent proof that one can reveal the age of one's soul through his music. As flat & shallow as the most electronically plumped pop crap on the so called country charts today, is Hank Williams III deep. Next to III, His Father may as well be a fat drunk in a seedy karaoke bar. This young man does his Grandpa proud & them some. He seems possessed of the spirit without having to struggle to invent an identity of his own like his father before him to step out of big Hank's shadow. III steps into the shadow and lights it up like a state fair on the 4th of July. It is all there. It has skipped a generation but it is in the marrow of his bones. In fact he's a damn good living argument for re-incarnation if you ask me. Haunting is a word that is in my mind every time I play my copy of one of his albums. But this isn't for someone looking for a fair impression of Grandpa as his father once did. I myself find myself listening to III then putting on a bit of Grandpa & after a few songs I'm hungry for this all together new phenomenon. The dimensions he reveals & the music he creates in doing so. It's not old fashioned country, nor rockabilly, punk, rock or anything that I think can be pigeon holed. It is as new a form as the bop with which Charlie Parker once rocked the Jazz world. Hank III's versatility is beyond description. Surrounding himself with a posse of daredevil side men who are as hot, versatile & inventive as he, Hank III will have you banging on the Internet for more discs & cursing his woebegone label for holding him back. So talented & so obviously deep a well of humanity is this young man that it would come as no surprise to me if someone, someday mined a great acting ability from that well. The distant mournful look in his eyes within the innocent childlike face belies any image of less to which any reviewer of poorer soul may point. He is at once, dark, mournful, childishly cocky, sexy, raw & miscieveouly playful. He has a facet for every emotion a listener can possibly need expressed through music. You will put him on when you're blue and end up cheered, you will put him on for a good time & end up haunted long after the album has reached it's end. He comes across as the kind of guy with whom any fun loving man would like to roll one, go out & get plastered & any woman would want to hole up for a stormy few days in shack with a guitar & couple of bottles of J.D. I pray he can get by & be happy without ever selling out to the industry & falling into the same crap mold of all the big Nashville/Hollywood stars who pass for country artists today.

1	One Of My Favorite Hip-Hop Albums.. I love this album.. every track fits perfectly.. this is good hip-hop the way that it's supposed to be done. I don't know which track I would consider my favorite since overall I like every one but I would say that the beat to T.R.O.Y is just plain out awesome one of my favorites of all time. If you want some hip-hop look no further check this out. You will not be disapointed. Justi
1	Pete Rock & CL Smooth This is a very enjoyable hip-hop album that was a breath of fresh air when it sppeared. Although it lacks a super-duper classic tune, it is strong on 90 percent of the songs. The only problem for the artists who recorded the album is, it is so good, there isn't anything else to say at the end. How can Pete Rock and CL Smooth do any better? This is their 'Invisible Man' so it did not shock me that they did not record much after the release of this gem. CL Smooth appears to improvise at times on this album and doesn't sound rehearsed (much rap does). Pete Rock's beats are superb. Don't waste your money on sex rap or crime rap; get this one, and learn
0	KIDZ BOP MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!! Who keeps coming out with these CD's? Who is crazy, stupid, retarted, and idiotic enough to make so many Kidz Bops!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? They KILLED My Immortal which is my absolute FAVORITE song that was ever written on the face of this earth!!!!!!!! The adult who sings the leads on Toxic sounds like somebody's grandmother being eaten by giant mutated brocolli. I'm serious--and I don't even like Britney Spears. Who is buying this crap? THE TERROR MUST STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	A Little Country, But Still a Rocker What a change for Bob Dylan. First he was a folk singer, than a hard rocker and now it seems he'd turned direction, going a bit country. However, don't make any mistake, just because he's got country musicians, this is still a rocker and it's one of my top five favorite Dylan records. "John Wesley Harding" is sort of a western ballad that will have you stamping your feet. "As I Went Out One Morning" is a country rocker with a message. So are many of the other songs on this record
0	Classic album -- TERRIBLE remastering First of all, I want to make clear that I think this is a phenomenal, 5-star album. This review is for the remastered edition of the cd only. If you already have the original cd release of this, hold on to it. That one has problems, but it at least sounds true to the original album. This remaster is an atrocity. The drums dominate the mix (sorry Cozy -- I don't love you THAT much), while the vocals float in the background. Worst of all, you have to strain to hear the guitar in many parts, with the synthesizer far more prominent. Whoever remixed this is an idiot. Evidently, they think that Ritchie Blackmore was the LEAST important person in this band. I assume that most Rainbow fans would disagree--with no disrespect to the rest of this legendary lineup. Rainbow Rising is classic rock for people who enjoy guitar, not nu-metal for people who want to demo their subwoofers. It should have been mixed that way. Beyond the sound of it, all these Rainbow remastered re-issues are a rip-off in every other way, as well. No liner notes. No lyrics. No bonus tracks (not even the inclusion of "Jealous Lover" with Difficult to Cure, which was on a cd single at the time of the album's release). These re-issues are the worst I've seen from any band. Compare them to the Deep Purple anniversary remasters and it becomes obvious how much more could have been done with these. In my opinion, this is an insult to the diehard fans who are purchasing these releases for the third or fourth time (lp, first cd release, Japan import cd, and newly "remastered" version). If you don't have this yet, you should buy any version you can find as quickly as possible, because you've been missing out. But for anyone who already has a previous release of this cd, you should just save your money
1	Musically Fit As a musician, I find &quot;Not Guilty&quot; to be of a very high standard, musically. Calvin Rodgers is awesome and unmatched on the drums. The musicians kept the Groove in the pocket. This is a very professionally done project and it is an example of a &quot;More excellent way&quot; of ministering the Gospel in today's world.I listen to the CD daily. Who said that we cannot play Jazz, R&amp;B, Rap, Hip Hop etc etc? Yes, &quot;IT'S POSSIBLE&quot; but the difference here is The Anointing; Lyrics to point folks to Jesus, and Music, saturated with the God kinda vibe played in the vernacular of the man on the street. Pastor Kee, you are a trend setter. Keep up the good work. So Folks, go out there and purchase a copy today. It will change your life
0	Boring! The first song is okay... the rest are incredible boring. This album is completely unoriginal. I regret buying it.
0	An ozzy osbourne rippoff, don't buy Have U heard "let's go" from from this poser who thinks nobody has ever heard crazy train from ozzy osbourne? He completely killed a really cool part of that song and replaced a really hardcore song with somthing dumb like "Let's Go!!!!!" and other dumb rhymes. I never understood why rap did this. Think of me as white heavy metal trash if U want but at least heavy metal people play guitar and rappers use mics and rap about things nobody cares about. Heavy metal people are experienced with their fingers while rappers like Trick Daddy use their palms (think about that for a minute) now if U like trick daddy I have no problem with that. I would also have no problem if they did a cover for crazy train from ozzy but I get pissed if they start ripping off giutar riffs from him. I'm more of a heavy metal type of guy but I like SOME rap. Listen to Eminem, Ludicris, or Lil'John if U wanna hear some rap with original Ideas
0	Bad Title, Good Music Although I do not agree with the message this CD is trying to get across, I will say the music is great. I think Rock Stars/Celebrities should quit pushing their views on easily persuaded 16 year olds who think of Rock stars as idols. It seems people in this world don't make up their own mind anymore, instead they are manipulated by the "Loud-Mouth Minority." Get your facts straight, but in the meantime, enjoy the great music. 2 stars for good music, missing 3 stars for the stupid message they are pushing forward
1	A great performance I have a very special care for this Vivaldi's work. Somehow, life has made me aware of many forms of interpretation of this very concert. Yesterday I was listening to it and I was aware of some details that made me look for it. I simply knew that the director was asking for wonderful new sounds that are not often to be found in the average performance of this masterwork. Often, my favourite version is the one of "I Musici". Yet I wasn't too surprised to find it was Osawa the conducer of this amazing version. I had had the chance of listening to previous works by him and I realize how he manages to make a classical always present. If he is the director of this record, no doubt, it is worthwile
1	Relation to other comments A few points about the bad reviews sitting in here... Master Shake shurrup you should be slapped about the room!!! Mathew Braxmeier --- Generic Emo??? I bet you have never listened to Emo in your life man... Clueless Whiner!!! And as for a title lenght... What would you preffer? Something short n catchy for you like 'Wannabe' By the Spicegirls??? Did you buy the album or just search for sum bands you probably knew you wouldnt like so that u could moan about em??? And as for Jane Doe --- HHHMMMM there is the 'old favourite' Nirvana... WOW that would be amazing for sumbody to not like Nirvana thesedays... Granted they did write a few good songs... Heck even spawned Foo Fighters after the death but jesus samuel christ!!! Ive yet to meet sumbody thats not in love with them... And before you sit there and say... Aw i bet he hasnt heard anything other than smells like teen spirit and come as you are... Wrong! I have every album... I just choose not to listen to them to fall under the typical Category of Anotherone who goes with the crowd... As for Black Flag, Sex Pistols and The misfits... Wow a little bit of taste from someone who has yet to have a little bit of variation in her taste!!! Move with the times Jane... All great bands in their time just as Fall Out is a brilliant band of this time!!! Every song just as catchy as the next with this album... Yet to hear how they can sound the same as AFI, Greenday or Panic! Anyone who wants to whine send them my way... Im sure Jane will i noticed the only 2 reviews were complete and utter moans... Buy this album... It is sheer genius!!! At the same time check out these bands guys... - Hoobastank (New album out) - Jimmy Eat World - Stiff Little Fingers (Amazing Punk band from late 70's still going at the moment and touring soon) - Flogging Molly (Irish Punk) - Three Days Grace - American Hi-Fi (New Album) - Yellowcard (Amazin Band) - Papa Roach (Still Going Strong) - Panic! At The Disco - 3 Doors Dow
0	R&B singer or Rapper I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, "Sideline Ho" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close.
0	Barry ManiLOW...real low......... How did this guy ever get a recording contract? Not only is his singing style shmaltzy, but his voice is grating, whiney, and nasally. Besides being a self-admitted atheist and homosexual, he is a terrible singer. Very handsome, though. He looks like a cross between a giant mosquito and a Kangaroo who got into somebody's eye shadow and makeup kits. What an overrated wierdo. This guy had to have friends inside the industry. Manilow singing Tony Bennett or Bobby Darin is akin to Cedric the Entertainer playing Cary Grant or Clark Gable. In drag, no less
1	"Hits" the Spot "Hits" is a collection of 16 songs from Phil Collins solo career, from 1981-1998. I'm a big fan of Genesis (both Phil Collins' and Peter Gabriel's), and Phil's "Groovy Kind of Love" was playing on the way home on my first day of school, so I'll always have a soft spot for this collection, and though it's missing and has room for a couple of the hits I would have liked (like "Don't Lose My Number") I have gone through a couple of copies of this one. Phil really has a warmth and honesty to his love songs that's pretty unique. His earthy voice, matched with the particular production he prefers, captures and evokes the 1980s pretty well too. That's not to say he's just 1980s ballads. He also sings of contemporary issues like in "Another Day In Paradise" and "Both Sides of the Story", and does interesting descriptions of character in songs like "In The Air Tonight" and "Take Me Home". There's a good mix of all that here. Phil's voice can get pretty powerful, on "I Wish It Could Rain Down" for intance. He'd come a long way from quietly singing "For Absent Friends" (one of his first recorded songs, featured on the 1971 Genesis album "Nursery Cryme"). He's a great drummer too, always had been, and even then he's not afraid to play around with a drum machine, which were seen to some as a bit threatening in the 1980s, from what I've read. The bonus track on "Hits" is a version of Cyndi Lauper's "True Colours", with some backing vocals by Babyface. It's pretty laid back, fits in with the hits, and I'm glad to have it. The booklet folds out into a mini-poster with the vague impressions of his solo album covers (as painted on this CD art) on it. On the other side, there are credits for all the songs, which were interesting. I had no idea both Sting and Phil's old friend Peter Gabriel do backup vocals of "Take Me Home", and I wouldn't have known unless I read it here. There's a 2 CD Phil Collins compilation out there called "Love Songs", and while there's some good tracks, and some interesting bonus and live stuff on it, it's all slower and sentimental, and doesn't really show off Phil's versatility as well as "Hits". Plus, with this compilation, there are songs from soundtracks and non-Phil Collins albums (like "Buster", "Chinese Wall", etc) that you won't have to go hunting round for, as they're all here in one place. Genesis' "Turn it On Again: The Hits" would go well with this one, as it has Phil's other hits like "Invisble Touch", "I Can't Dance" and "Follow You, Follow Me". Recommended. Four and a half stars
0	Major Let Down I really enjoyed the first two books albums, I bought Thought for Food almost immediately after the Lemon of Pink because I enjoyed it so much. I found their sound to be quite original with an interesting balance of emotion and humor along with the balance between electronic and acoustic music. So I was really disappointed when I heard their new album. This record is clearly intended to be their breakthrough, with far more vocals and regular song structure and less expirementalism. The record even reuses some samples from old albums which was really annoying. This album lacks the interesting, unexpected twists from their previous works, and as a result comes off as generally bland and sometimes even cheesy. If you want a Books album, please check out the other two first
0	false information! said new, but wasnt they said the cd was new. that it was still in its shrink wrap and everything. instead, they sent me an old, delaphadated and used cd. it had many scratches on it, and one of the tracks wouldnt even play
0	Hello Mediocre I've been a Beastie Boys fan since I was in 8 years old. I played the cassette version of License to Ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones. And until a while ago I would maintain to anyone that EVERY Beastie Boys album was great, cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop's most talented artists. (Get to the point. I know, I know.) But I had never really owned "Hello Nasty' myself. It was the only one of their albums I hadn't picked upon release. Until recently. Now, upon closer inspection reveals that there really isn't a stand out track on the whole album. "Intergalactic," "Body Movin'" and "Super Disco Breakin'" may have been pseudo hits but they don't really stand out from the rest of the album, which feels like mostly filler. Decent filler, though. There are a few stinkers: "Song for the Man" (It's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting, but this track is utterly skippable) and Dedication (following House of Pain's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to). Like their previous two LPs, there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album. But in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed. I listened to it 4 times in a row while at work an couldn't really discern any standout track. But for what it's worth, I wasn't annoyed. All in all it's cool to hear the B-Boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound, but it's not mind blowing. I'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their CDs. It's certainly won't detract from your collection and there will be a time you'll want to listen to it. But I wouldn't expect to find yourself picking it over Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head or even To The 5 Boroughs (awesome, by the way) for that matter.
0	Just 'cause you're in a movie doesn't mean you're great singers The Cheetah girls are so full of themselves. I recommend the Cheetahs girls to 5- year olds
0	And then he composed himself... Let me start off by saying that after extensive therapy, I feel that I'm finally able to write this review. I've been reading some of the other comments on this board and all I can say is that I've never been an advocate of hindering people's right to free speech...until now. I just got finished listening to Jeffery Gaines's version of In Your Eyes and I have two burning questions that just won't go away. First of all, where is it that the other contributors to this board buy their smoke? And secondly, why didn't Mr. Gaines just cover Peter Gabriel in gasoline, strike a match, and call it even? On the other hand, I must agree with a few of these people on one point: this version of In Your Eyes evokes emotions in me I never thought I had the capacity to realize. I honestly can't say I blame anyone who finds their eyes welling up with tears when confronted with this towering monument to mediocrity--I had the same experience myself. And as for those wisened souls who feel this version has some measure of value and, in fact, &quot;blows Peter Gabriel's version out of the water,&quot; here's a thought for you to tax your proton-sized brains over: a nuclear bomb can blow many things out of the water, but that doesn't make it a good thing to inflict on innocent people. But if, after considering this, you still arrive at your original conclusion, there's only one course of action I can self-respectingly recommend. Take your own life. Do it now before it's too late
1	This band was so far ahead of it's time . . . that you will discover them very soon - buy this disc! Seriously, I had vinyl of both of these releases in college and as CD's took over replaced my vinyl with this. It's pure psychedelic power pop done right, combining sing along hook happy elements of the Beatles, ethereal layered guitar work with background electronics that really put it "out there". Front man Mitch Easter of course played a hand in putting REM at the forefront of college radio and it's unfortunate that his excellent work with Let's Active never really made it into the mainstream consciousness. Those who have heard it know. Buy this, love it, and then move on to Big Plans for Everybody
0	All garbage doesn't sell In today's rap market the hot commodities are the albums that have the most materialism, disrespect to women, and "gangsta fairytales". Well Shawnna's album has all of the above and her sales are poor. So what does that say for Shawnna. She can't even sell in a market that caters to commercial BS!!!!!! This album is garbage, Shawnna is chi-town garbage and needs to find a new occupation. I suggest her finding either the nearest strip club (since she is from the chi I suggest Arnie's in Harvey!) or find the nearest porn studio for a more productive career
1	IMPRESSIVE This is a very good dance album with amazing lyrics and beats! i remeber when i first saw the "Dancing Queen" video on Disney Channel when i was in 5th grade and i was truly captivated by them! AND THIS IS AN AMAZING DANCE ALBUM for the fisrt 7 songs My Favorite songs Mamma Mia (Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie) a man after midnight Super Trouper One of Us Voulez-Vouz S.O.S 1.Mamma Mia-10/10 2.(Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie) a man after midnight-I LOVE this song it is just one of the most amazing songs to dance to.10/10 3.Super Trouper-AWWW this is sucha sweet song with dance- i LOVE the beat.10/10 4.One of Us-GREAT lyricz 9/10 5.Voulez Vouz- a really great song to dance to, with amazing beats and rythms, My 2ns favorite song on this album 6.S.O.S-REALLY GOOD 10/10 7.Dancing Queen- THIS WAS MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE SONG EVER(back then) now i dont think its all that great, but i still love the video. After these seven songs the album just gets pretty lame. BUT TRUST ME- THESE SONGS ARE WORTH IT Final Grade-9/10
0	Open your ears, people. This record blowz. The tunes last forever -- one verse after another, same crap melody over and over, no drama, no nothing except the old ennui, which I guess is what appeals to some folks. And Lenny couldn't manage to sing in tune for more than three consecutive notes. He's improved somewhat over the years, but you all really need too look up from your "Fleurs de Mal" once in awhile. Poetry is poetry, music is music, and while Leonard's poetry may speak to you, his music sucks
0	White Bread Christmas? Indeed....... I've always thought of Diana Krall as a sellout. I've been told that she was not a singer by choice, that record execs saw dollar signs and "encouraged" this mediocre pianist to sing. They were lucky that Krall has a nice voice quality and sings in tune, and can swing in a very middle of the road, 2 levels above white bread kind of way. But as a performer, she comes off as an emotionless robot. Her overall delivery is a droning monotone. Every song is performed the same way, in a husky, lilting, and ultimately boring as hell manner. Since Norah Jones has effectively blown Krall out of the water in terms of sales, what could they think of as a comeback? How bout a Christmas album! Nothing says sellout like Christmas. And I actually like some of those songs, but to be honest, I'd rather sit around and sing them with my friends than listen to Krall sleepwalk through this set of traditional tunes. In fact, I'd rather go Christmas Caroling in the Gaza Strip than listen to this unimaginative, boring, lifeless collection of performances. OK, maybe I'm being too harsh. But once a tool, always a tool. Krall is too much part of the machine, so if she did have an original idea, I doubt there would be anyone in the company that would let her try it. Some the arrangements on this disc have nice orchestration, but overall sound very functional, commercial, and bland. Which fit perfectly with Krall's bland delivery. Even when she tries to emote on Mel Torme's great composition " The Christmas Song", it sounds disingenuine. I think of Diana Krall as a product. When a business school grad goes to work at a corporation, they come in with profit as their goal. So whatever product they want to market and sell to the American public, and hopefully the World market, they want to have the most widespread appeal possible. Diana Krall is the Coca Cola Sugar Water of music. Sugary Sweet, a buxom blond with very little nutrition or substance in her artistry. But the vast public wants a CD, i mean, product, that they can put on at a dinner party and basically talk over and say, " We love jazz! Here's our Diana Krall CD." Diana's pose on the front cover says it all. Pretty and all dressed up but just lays there lifeless. It's almost a pose of defeat. Even sellouts have their limits
0	Barbara Cook Disappoints I was very disappointed in this CD. I like her and have been a fan for years. I think the piano accompaniment didn't do her justice either. I listened to half and couldn't be bothered to finish the rest. I was so disappointed, especially since I had read such good reviews of it
0	DIS ALBOOM RULEZ!!!!!!!!!!!! DIS ALBOOM IZ SOOO HAWT AND SEXI!!! CHINGY IZ DA BOMB!!! PLZ BUY DIS!!! ITZ ON MTV SO IT MUST RULE!!!

All of that was untrue! Chingy sucks and he's the worst rapper ever! P.S. Iron Maiden and Sepultura are amazing and Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park suck
0	It sucks man,but rap is dying out like Basic Cable Rappers like this piece of S***,him and Nelly,all that southern bull is the reason rap is flockin,one of theese days 50 and Ja are gonna end up like big n pac.What i do is,i be honest is i listen to rap and rock,also thats played out if you want to wath thoose new bands and there videos watch Fuse,but anyway i may be laughed at n S*** but i listen to rap from the 90's and the early 2000's cause there aint jack S*** out there but bubble Gum M.C.,s.Anyway lets get back to Chingy,the only good major release he has is that Jackpot BullS***.Plus his F***** style is annoying he sounds like a chipmunk on Helium.

1	the first review/kagemusha well, this is the first time for a review, and i was recomended to this review. so here it goes.First of all wow!!! i mean wooow what a score, Bear McCreary did a hell of a job on this project. Its like a mix of all kinds of composers , like Harry Gregson Williams( from Man on Fire), Halo lot of cue`s, i could go on, and ofcause a danish group called Safri Duo. If anyone of your guys and girls like this kind of sumption , then buy it now
1	Prince's Hip Hop Revolution We had already seen an album with Hip Hop infleunts on "Diamonds and Pearls" from 1991, this album from 1992 commonly called The Symbol or just Prince & The Power Generation is the album where it eventually sounds like a band performing together, and not a semi-solo album like "Diamonds". They also go one level further with even more hip hop sound then on any other album. "My Name is Prince" samples his old song "I Wanna Be Your Lover" among others in the beginning, the song itself is a catchy hip hop infleunted song with both raps and samples. Prince also raps here and he's loud as even before. With lyrics such as "My name is Prince and I am funky,My name is Prince the one and only" it may sound ego-centric but with all the things he's done and experienced he got the right to. "Sexy M.F" was a song that the radio didn't want to play cause of it's explicit lyrics and (title aswell). On MTV is became a massive hit but it was highly censored. It feaurures guitars and classic horns. "Love 2 the 9's" is a middle paced slow jam, still with hip hop sound though. "Morning Papers" is anothe ballad, but more relaxed. Great lyrics like "If he poured his heart into a glass, And offered it like wine ,She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers". "The Max" is a funky hip hopish number where NPG show it's potential. "Blue Light" is a slow paced song with reggae sound somehow. "Eye Wanna Melt With U" Is also funky explicit song about sex. "Sweet Baby" is the opposite, a very emotional ballad about love. "Continental" is a up-tempo song with horns where NPG once again show what they got. "Damn U" is a slow trendy ballad. "Arrogance" is only 1.35, and sound more like a funny number then anything serious. "The Flow" is also a funky song that feaurueres horns, pretty typical for this album. "7" was one of the biggest hits from this album, a middle tempo odd number that does't really fit in here. "All 7 and we'll watch them fall, They stand in the way of love, and we will smoke them all, With an intellect and a savoir-faire" It's aparently about a man from the bible that will never grow old. Ditto with "And God Created Woman", a beautiful ballad perfectly suited for a Prince album. "3 Chains of Gold" is midtempo mini-opera that goes on for over 6 minutes, it's part soulish falsetto and part guitar solo's. Very Unique. "Sacrifice of Victor" is a funky song that portrait Prince as a civil rights activist and goes back discussing the riots after Martin Luther King Jr's death. Overall, this album is much more focused then the last one and here most songs are either funky hip hop sounding ot smooth ballds. It doesn't feel like a solo album anymore and NPG get's much more space then on any other album. The lyrics are exceptionally on point here and the rock opera on "3 Chains of Gold" is one not to miss. Although it was messy There were more natural hit singles in "Diamonds" though and this "Symbol" album get's a little repetitive at times, on the other hand it's proves that Prince was able to melt into the early 90's hip hop revolution and do it with class. 4/
0	Waste of money I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all
1	A DREAM WORTH WAITING FOR A dream is what your heart makes. And for years we've been dreaming and wishing that Cinderella would make a comeback. And thanks to the magic of Disney, our wish has been granted. (Please do not mix up this Cinderella with the punk-rock band of the same name. This is music; that is a mess.) We are happy to see (and hear) that extra tracks, including two demo recordings. And though we understand Disney's marketing techniques, we do wish that the added performances by Jim Brickman and Kimberely Locke would go away. Maybe if we close our eyes real tight and chant those three magic words. All together now: bibbidi-bobbidi-boo ..
1	Murs is top notch. When your drowning in the world of trendy, here today, gone tomorrow rappers... Murs is a breath of fresh air. I like every track on this album, as well as 3:16. Usually I pick up an album, like a few tracks, and listen to the dope tracks and that's it. I wish it were a little longer, or contained a few more tracks. Still a dope album though
0	POMPOUS, SELF INDULGENT DRIVEL! Just like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin in most peoples eyes can do no wrong. Sorry they can and this along with 'in through the outdoor' is a band so full of self importance that they can serve up drivel like this and go platinum. I mean if any other band served up psuedo raggae(d'yer maker), a funk James Brown catastrophe (the crunge), half finished songs (dancing days, the ocean)and a complete mish mash of ideas (song remains the same) it would be career suicide, not Zeppelin though. I find their arrogance on this quite breathtaking. Sure 'no quater' and 'over the hills' are great, but Jesus doesn't Plants warblings and hippy drippy lyrics grate after a while. Mind you he never was that great when compared with say Paul Rogers or Ian Gillan. The only saving grace with this is one of the greatest cover designs ever
1	Classic ***** a perfect album. start to finish. i don't know what more to say. 5 stars for Neko
1	Dick needs to get some.... I was laughing hysterically when I read Dicks review of John Lennon, I looked at the other things he reviewed - aprox. 10 albums, and he was bitching about them all, gave them all one star, so the only albums he reviewed were the ones he disliked....oh yeah except for the BEEGEE's, he likes them. lol So forget peace and love and understanding- its all jive talking.
0	Inner thoughts from a hollow man. Imagine no possessions? Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces. Imagine no religion? Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit. Imagine no countries? Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador. The world will be as one? Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most. John Lennon was a text book phony. He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't. Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now. The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation. His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn. Thank you very much. -DW.
1	Fun listen... more fun the second time, even more fun after that! I'm a recording engineer by trade. I sit in little rooms with no windows and big speakers listening to the same song for 15 hour stretches for weeks in a row. Every now and again a record will roll through that is actually fun to make. This sounds like one of those recordings. Whether or not the players took this seriously or not will only be known to them and the production team, but the presentation comes across as if it was just a bunch of talented friends hanging around a studio and having some fun making music. With a great cover version of one of my absolute favorite Hank songs, the album might have been able to leave one or two songs in the can... but rip the album to an iPod and those songs can be the right breath of fresh air as you're driving. The audio quality and production decisions of the recording should also be noted. Yeah, there are some notes of questionable tuning but the their presentation is so believable the record would not have been served if those notes had been corrected. Matt Marinelli captured the sounds with perfection, and didn't over process or manipulate it later [or so it seems!!]. The record works for me in a big way and I for one am exceptionally happy to own a copy of this recording [a client for whom I'm going to start a project in a few months sent me the copy as a kind of template for the way he'd like his project to come out... if we get 1/2 way there then that is going to be one damn fun project!!]
1	great Cd I bought this CD for my grandson and he just loves it. I enjoyed it too. Just loved all of Trace Adkins music on the CD
0	A few good bands but WAY to much emo/screamo This is an okay compilation however its far from the best. If your looking for good punk music you wont find much of it here. Heres a list of the bands i thought were pretty good The Offspring Pennywise Strung Out Strike Anywhere MxPx Millencoln No Use For A Name Street Dogs Plain White T's I really hate emo music, And it's not like a really really hate all screamo/hardcore music its just that i really don't wanna hear like 40 songs in arow of it it almost sounds the same. Hopfully next year there will be some more punkish bands on the tour such as Propagandhi, Nofx, Desendendents,Pennywise, Rise Against, Black Flag, Anti-Flag...et
1	Classic Soundtrack This soundtrack is a mix. My favorite songs are some of the prototype 80's tracks: Danger Zone, Mighty Wings, & Through the Fire. But it also has some great oldies like Dock of the Bay & Great Balls of Fire. If you haven't seen this movie yet then go out and rent it. Then pick up a copy of the soundtrack
1	50 Times And Counting... I have owned this CD since the day it came out and I have not stopped listening to it. I like all rap and hip-hop for the most part. I love lyric, social driven rap like The Roots and Talib Kweli and Mos Def, but I also have no problem throwing crunk club ish in the deck like Three Six Mafia or Lil' Jon. That said, this album completely blows me away and it seriously pains me that Obie Trice is so slept on. This album is better than Second Round's On Me, most likely because he had more help from Em on this one truthfully, but still, both CDs are great. I just wanted to write this review to do something to try to spread the word. This CD is unbelievable. My three favorite rap CDs of all time are the Notorious BIG- Life After Death, Eminem- The Eminem Show, & Obie Trice- Cheers. I love the female-problem-driven songs on here like Lady, Hands On Me, & even Don't Come Down about his mama. The lyrics are unreal and his style is unprecedented and fresh. He is creative, witty, and his flow is downright cold, not to mention production is superb. Please buy this CD
1	Get Down With Da Goblin Profondo Rosso is probably Goblin's finest hour in the soundtrack department, though I think many would debate that Suspiria and Zombi might be a little better. I won't go into the music, coz I can't imagine someone buying this cd who's unfamiliar with the film and the music from the film. You do get your money's worth, this sucker is 72 minutes long. My only complaint with this, and all the other Goblin soundtracks is that there are about eight billion different versions of the same song. I know people like this, but to me it gets a little irritating. The alternate versions aren't really all that different from one another(with a few exceptions)-at least not different enough to want to hear the song again when you just heard it one or two tracks ago. I mean, do we really need that many versions of the lullaby song? But on the other hand, I do respect the fact that Cinevox went out of their way to make this as complete as possible. And considering you have to take out a loan to pay for these soundtracks, it doesn't seem so bad in the end. What it really comes down to is-If you like the music when you watch the film, then you'll like this cd
0	ewwww.... I honestly hate Kidz Bop. I mean, Avril Lavigne is my favorite singer, and My Happy Ending is too good of a song to be wrecked by Kidz Bop. I mean, I sing in the shower better then these kids! Don't buy it. Borrow it from the library if you must.
0	The Duke Meets The Earl I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record
1	AWESOME! BUY THIS ALBUM! Seriously, this is one amazing cd. Every single song on this cd is worthy of your purchase. I promise you will not be dissapointed
1	So Good Man, this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove. Just kidding I don't ride motorcycles, but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul. It can't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine, moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas
1	It takes a while... I grew up on Dylan... in fact, Dylan is my middle name. I was very intimate with his songs from a very early age. When I bought this album in the early '90s, I was still in high school. At first, I remember thinking that his voice was gone. I didn't think I could listen to the entire album. I struggled through it and put it on a shelf. From time to time, I forced myself to listen to it. I don't know exactly when the change took place... I suppose I grew up a bit, musically. Good As I Been To You started to take shape. The guitar... the harp... the voice. All of a sudden, it meant something entirely different. It made sense. It all came together. Now, fourteen years later, I listen to this album at least once a week. I will not hesitate to say that this is a great album. But, for some reason, it needs to grow on you. It builds up to some subtle crescendo. Then, suddenly, it will hit you like a ton of bricks. Dylan knew exactly what he was doing. This is his re-entry into greatness after a few years astray. The guitar picking is incredible. His voice couldn't be more appropriate for the content. If you need more proof, just look at what the (rare) vinyl form of this album can fetch. I recently acquired the LP, and it is the most expensive one in my collection! Those 'in the know' really know what this album is worth. Give it a try... then try it again. Let the guitar flow through you for a while. Sing along. Go ahead and try. It's not that easy. You'll soom see why this IS one of Dylan's greatest albums. I say that as a hard-core Dylan fan, so don't take it lightly
1	Stunning... Sheer intangible musical brilliance I bought this album because of the opening track, "The Hollow," which, after listening to it online, I felt as if it was the most incredibly melodic rock song I've heard in a long time. I also thought Maynard's voice sounded absolutely amazing on that song. So I went out a bought the album about an hour ago, literally! Every song is amazing! Even though many of the songs are heavy, they have this highly ambient melodic feel to them, especially with Billy Howerdel's and Troy Van Leeuwen's guitar playing, which really shine all the way through on the album. They use some very interesting guitar effects for virtually every song. In any event, whether you are a fan of Tool or not, a fan of Maynard's or not, BUY THIS ALBUM! I'll admit, I'm a fan of Tool, no doubt, especially the albums "Aenima," and "Lateralus," which both have some of the most incredible progressive metal music on them, but I almost like this band better. I like the fact that APC is just about as heavy as Tool, more melodic, have a more polished sound, are more experimental and progressive (in my opinion) than most of what I've heard from Tool. This is not to discredit Tool's work, of course, whose music has already been etched in the alms of metal and hard rock history, it is just to say that APC is another alternative. Whether or not this is a "side project" of Maynard's or not, it does not matter to me, the band and album is flipping amazing in every which way! FAVORITE SONGS: "THE HOLLOW," "ORESTES," and "3 Libras".
1	Jesse in CA Unbelievable songwriting! How could TJW go relatively unnoticed as he has been in the music industry? I just saw him in Los Angeles last week in a smaller venue and he tore the roof off the place!!! Just him, his Stratocaster & harmonica and a drummer. With the PA system set up right he sounded like a 5-piece band with just the 2 of them! One Hot July is probably his best effort to date in my opinion and now I'm currently in the process of purchasing everything he's ever put out!!! Buy this album and experience some of the best music ever produced
0	A baby band................... The CARS were one of the most annoying, dumb, pathetic, lame, overrated, stupid, lousy, and awful bands ever came out in the 70's. Their lead singer RIC OCASEK sings horribly and sings like a baby. This greatest-hits album was a huge joke that each and every song is incredibly bad. Their guitar playing is really bad. They are only recommended for loosers. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this album and avoid CD's from the Cars, Nirvana, and AC/DC who suck. Listen to good bands like Foreigner and Dire Straits insted. ps.the cars are for babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Tropical Jazz There are some great songs on this cd. Club Paradiso,&quot;Be Cool,Love Child,I Found Heaven,and the title track are my favs. It's smooth jazz with a tropical twist. Be Cool stars Dave Koz another one of my favorite smooth jazz artists
0	sorry Latinosoulboy ,U GOT IT WRONG this is whats wrong with most of the smooth jazz genre.lame mechanical tracks thrown over a bed of programmed drums.Its time to get REAL and play it that way!!!!!
1	Great album This is one of my most favorite Commissioned albums ever. Reason being is because Fred and Marvin are great singers and this was the last project they had together before their solo careers really took flight. I love this album, "Dare to Believe" is a classic. "I'm Learning" is one of my all-time favorites. "Love Is The Way" and "Come Home" are two blazing, bumping tracks that will get you bobbing your head. Then the album goes urban praise and worship on the last few tracks which is uplifting and spiritual. "Draw Me Nearer" is, vocally, Commissioned at its best. Another one to add to the collection
1	A Timeless and Smooth New Order Album Of all the New Order albums that I own, I would have to say that Republic has been my favorite throughout the years. I enjoy listening to this album the whole way through, and with the order that they used to lay out the songs, you can have it on repeat and want to listen to it again and again. So you can understand my interpretation of the feel of the album and why I like it, I will tell you that I enjoy this album because of the musical style it has, which in my opinion, has a timeless and smooth quality to it. Each song starts out brilliantly, and although it would go well on a pop radio station, it seems a little more mature and unique than your typical pop tune, using a fine combination of guitars, keyboards, and at times, a choir and a symphony. To describe the feel of each song, as each song progresses, you become more settled as the rythm and the background (almost a classical style-like music) resonates and blends with the guitars and keyboards even more as the song reaches it's climax. Bernard Sumner's vocals seemed to be most at home with this style. With Coldplay, Dido, Sarah McLachlan, Delerium, Balligomingo, and many others in my most frequently listened to category, this one definitely goes well in the mix... the mix for chillin. :
0	Wow., This stuns me in its mediocracy This is truly one of the worst Goth and related genre compilations I have ever heard. With the PARTIAL Exception of disk # 2, the songs chosen of even the best bands were among their worst or most mundane songs. It almost seems as if someone was given a list of bands and their songs and said 'pick songs to go on this album' they put up a list of songs up on a board and picked them by randomly throwing darts at it. Great bands on disk 1, but again they picked some of the more mundane songs overall from Bauhaus, Legendary Pink Dots, Die Form, Christian Death (Disk 4) and some of the more classic favorites. Again- on disk 2 which showed the most promise for other than the utterly mundane they had poor song choices- for example they chose 'Drool' for Switchblade Symphony (which is a band I truly adore otherwise) which is one of their least impressive and mundane songs. Though they made it clear by the intro this was not just 'goth' music, but supposed to encompass Industrial and Darkwave as well, I was stunned at how little Gothic and Darkwave music there really was- and was perplexed as to why they bothered putting metal-related bands on like Two Witches and several others on the compilation. A few good songs scattered on disk 2 and 3, but why pay for 4 disks of music with some to a few good songs on each, when everything worth listening to could have just gone on 1 album? Hours of boredom listening for a few gems. For a good compilation I would recommend the Goth Box and the Disease of Lady Madeline
0	Fun in Small Doses AFI's debut album is a great deal different from their last few CDs. There is no traces of Goth or pop punk here, just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics. The problem with this album is it's all the same, there's almost no variation, so it's good when you listen to just a few tracks (all of which are good) but put back to back it's impossible to get through the entire CD without a headache. The two standout tracks for me are "High School Football Hero" and the Classic "I Want a Mohawk but My Mom Won't Let Me Get One". The music reminds me alot of MxPx's debut CD "Pokinatcha", but the lyrics are alot more similar to the Offspring. Definitely a good CD if you wanna see where the band started and you're already a fan, but if you're new to AFI and want to backtrack from Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground I recomend either Black Sails in the Sunset or the All Hallows EP instead
1	Maybe even 5 stars I have now retracted an earlier negative review. I have played it since and enjoyed it. I was overly critical. I do play it and enjoy it. (ONE AND ONLY LOVE ALBUM) REALLY DOES BLOW THIS ONE AWAY THOUGH AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME (100 STARS)
1	continued brilliance Whenever anyone lists Joe's best albums, this one always appears at the top of any list. It really is amazing, with some of Joe's signature work, not the least of which is Summer Song, which has sort of become his anthem. This is a powerful song that rocks nonstop. The title track gets down in it, and the song Friends carries such an optimistic feel to it. Joe is the master at delivering a message without saying a single word. His guitar does the speaking for him, and it speaks beautifully. War and Motorcycle Driver are another couple of hard rockers. Cryin' is easy and more contemplative, and Rubina's Blue Sky Happiness sounds like a courtship song, something to be played on a warm spring day with your sweetie. I'm not sure what the name The Extremist means, but if it involves Joe's mastery of the electric guitar, then the title sure fits him.
0	girly chick lit god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after." the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!! if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.
1	Alan Jackson Precious Memories CD The is a wonderful collection of hymns. Alan should do more acoustic work. Glad his mother was finally able to get him to cut the CD. Sang most of the songs while growing up in El Paso. Already liked Alan but this collection of songs shows he is blessed with talent. Have bought 2 of these to share with family members. My aunt who just turned 99, thought it was great.
0	Listen First I wish I could have found a snippit of each song when deciding whether or not to purchase this album. Instead I relied upon the other reviews and my memory of 'Take On Me' and 'The Living Daylights' from when I was younger. I decided to take a chance and purchase this album. I listened to the album once and have no real desire to hear it again. The music/lyrics stink (unless the listener considers hearing about broken relationships and lack of commitment to other people and oneself enjoyable). I would definitely listen to any of Ah-Ha's albums/songs prior to deciding whether or not to purchase them
1	Great Mirman's humor is an acquired taste, but once you acquire that taste, you will keep coming back and reveling in its deliciousness over and over again. The problem with Eugene lies mostly in the fact that you have to appreciate utter absurdity in order to enjoy him. I can enjoy it and I love the album. Take a sample, if you like one bit, take the whole thing. Otherwise, wait awhile, Mirman needs time to truly live up to his potential which he gives us a peak at in "Florida" and "Shapes for Sale."
0	Should a comedy album feature pity laughter? Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy. I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off
0	A classic? This just furthers my argument even more. Just because an album is more than 10 years old by a "legendary" group doesn'tmean that it's good or even a classic. This is classh** at its finest. I actually owned this album at one point when I was young and stupid. But i wasn't that stupid cause I got rid of it quick. You mean to tell me this album is derived from true creativity from ones heart. Lyrics that mean somethin. Thats what hip hop is all about and this is not a hip hop album. There is nothin creative about this album at all. Its a dance album for freaks. Now if you lookin at this from that point of view, then I guess this is a 5 star album. But for someone to call this a hip hop classic you have no idea what a hip hop classic is. You just don't. Damn can the state of hip hop be so f***ed up when anything by 2 LIve Crew can be considered worth owning, let alone being called a classic? If you give this 5 stars,then trash garbage rappers the likes of Chingy, Nelly, Trina, Khia, Camron, DFB, D4L. then your the biggest hypocrite typing reviews on amazon. 2 Live Crew in my opinion, lyrically is in the top 5 of the worst rappers in history. And they are just as one dimensional as your most hated rapper. If you don't believe me just scope out ALL their album covers and song titles. And ask yourself can you really call these bums artist. Seriously I cant get it through my head why somebody over the age of 18 would actually by this s***. I just cant
0	What the game's been missin? Not you Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this.
0	Such a Let Down I write from the perspective of a life-long fan. This was one of the first modern bands that I loved and I followed their every release from my preteen years onward. They seemed to never miss the mark creatively or sonically, and the increasingly strong imagination and coherence behind each record was only matched by the increasingly complex production. But on this release, they seem to have run out of ideas and melodies and passion. That hurts to say, but it is painfully true. I'll accept this as their auto-pilot record. The reason I give it two stars is because it makes me appreciate Yoshimi, an album I initially viewed as a disappointment in the shadow of the Soft Bulletin, as a proper album (albiet a lateral move)
0	What happend to the BTNH we used to know? I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time.
0	Hey, Where's Crispy Critters? No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work! Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits. What a disappointment
1	Best Song Cycle Ever Written! I believe that this is the best song cycle ever written and remains as one of my favourite Guettel pieces. The songs on this CD are extraordinary, extremely well written and cleverly assembled. I have also bought the sheet music which confirms his musical genius even further and also contains many songs not on the CD such as Prometheus, Jesus the Might Conquerer, Life is But a Dream and Build a Bridge, all of which are fabulous. This is a must for all music lovers! You won't regret it
0	they've finally dissapointed me i feel like crying right now, literally. i suppose that i saw this coming, even though i'd give anything to avoid it: the goo goo dolls have straight up sold out, and no other band could dissapoint me more than they could. the goo goo dolls were the sole band that brought me through my teens, and probably had the single most early influence on my taste in music. no other band had the intensity, musically and emotionally, that these guys captured on their earlier albums (albums like jed, hold me up, superstar carwash, or a boy named goo for all of you who started with dizzy). the complete lack of words to describe the feeling a certain song gives you-- you know what i'm talking about- these guys had it in everything they did. had it, past tense. their progression that critics tote as "maturing," alas, was the dolls slow descent into what they've become now. we (longtime fans) saw it and silently groaned to ourselves, not able to admit to ourselves that it was happening. it started with dizzy up the girl (with what, for or five singles? get serious). don't get me wrong, i enjoy that album, but only because it still has some of the magic that made the goo goo dolls what they were. the songs still felt real. gutterflower was the real omen; but at least the songs were still somewhat interesting, musically. and so it comes to this, another great band ruining itself. trust me, i tried desperately to like this cd. desperately. but it doesn't feel real. the lyrics are cheesy. the musicianship is way below par (as compard to their creative ability and talent). the songs are forgetable and all sound the same. the only song i found somewhat enjoyable was "listen." (the only taste of real ggd i could find on this cd). (and only two songs with robby on vocals? its a shame. his raspy voice is beautiful.) its hurts me immensely to say these things about john and robby. they've been my idols for more than half of my life. it feels like a part of me is dead. sounds cheesy, but the ggd have never dissapointed me. time to face up to the facts: they finally have. i guess all good things come to an end. so if you want to hear some good music, go to the used cd store and pick up superstar carwash, and hear what this really great band used to sound like.
1	For What It's Worth What a combination! Releasing a soundtrack that would pit traditional southern critics of bluegrass against rabid White Stripes fans from Detroit! I'm sure that Jack White isn't the only performer who is delighted with the controversy this album generated. Musicians just love the music......it's the critics who need to take a hike. This is a great album that showcases BOTH great traditional bluegrass AND well known rock musicians displaying a love of the human feeling that is embodied in bluegrass. So.....quitcherbitchin and enjoy it for what it is.....a nice soundtrack to a movie that showcases bluegrass for a wide popular audience
1	I'm flying over I love the last Five Years so much and so when this came out I got it immeadiately. The song Over is so great I listened to it Over and Over (no pun intended) I thnk no one does a ballad like Jason and I highly recommend the whole albu
1	Indie Masterpiece There is no doubt that I would rate this as one of the best abums of the 80's and Sonic Youth's best abum. However, if you are not a Sonic Youth fan already, I would steer you to their olater albums first. This album is very atmosphereic. It changes moods from mellow and pensive to raging guitar riffs. It has an almost purposeful low-fi sound (think of early albums from Dinosaur Jr. or Guided by Voices). If you are not into experimental, indie rock, go to Sonic Youth's later albums like "Goo" or "Dirty". They are more accessible. ( I wouldnt say that they compromise integrity though) However, if you are a music explorer; someone who likes bands like radiohead, there is a reason that Sonic Youth are considered the godfathers(with apologies to Kim Gordon, the female bassist) of underground music. I defy you to talk to a person who loves indie rock who does not love this band, and particularly this album.
1	Love Letter Stars - Set Yourself on Fire 5 out of 5 Stars To take a cue from the great single that never was," Elevator Love Letter", from Stars' last under heard/appreciated release, Heart. I humbly submit my love letter to Stars' latest magnum opus, Set Yourself on Fire: Dear Set Yourself on Fire, You've got some nerve, coming into my life under the pretense of eletronica and then making me feel something so strong. You grew on me. The last time I felt this way was when I first fell for The Beautiful South. Your interplay of male/female parts by singers Amy Millan and Torquil Campbell is unparalleled now. From the stunning propulsion on your namesake track through the cinematic sensuality of "The First Five Times", I feel you. I know I've only known you for a few months, but I feel like we've been together much longer. I have a massive crush on you. You're all chill songs, goose bumps and couch dancing fun. You glide into the room with "Your Ex Lover is Dead, but your hopeful closing refrain ("Calendar Girl") is "I'm alive!" It's sadly beautiful. You're an album, a collection of songs that come together to form something greater. Taken alone, your songs are great ("Ageless Beauty" and "Reunion"), but together they are unstoppable. Our time together is precious, there's no wasting it with any clunkers. You're listenable all the way through, good for driving, headphones, partying and maybe later...making out? It's inspiring, tragic, and heart warming. Your strings and horns are hot and the piano, harmonies and glockenspiel are your prettiest eyes. I'm riding this rollercoaster of mood swings, dancing and tempo shifts. "I am trying to say what I want to say without having to say..." Dare I say love, during wartime? It's 2005 and we're alive. You're the reason I listen to and look forward to new music. You're my payoff. What are you doing on Saturday? --- Jeff Kami
1	Fun and Catchy! People, honestly, who cares if Franz Ferdinand is today's best band or if this album is "funky" or not. This album is just good ol' fun music that's not at all watered down or lackluster. Just listen to this album and dance to it. Not every critical acclaimed album has to be a masterpiece.
0	A miserable, mopey masquerade Someone here says "alot of indie snobs love Deerhoof". That's correct, and that pretty much speaks volumes. Here's another band with hip vintage equipment, boring song structures, alot of connections, and nothing to say. As if there weren't enough of these bands out there. Absolutely nothing of consequence is going on here: it basically boils down to a phenomenal waste of human and natural resources to make this band's CDs and release them to their 30 or so fans (mostly indie rock CD store clerks). It is also a waste of your time, and mine, giving them another moment of thought. Extra points docked for the worst band name ever
0	Disappointed As a long time Beach Boys fan who is in his 50's, I was rooting for Brian Wilson to pull this off. Unfortunately, this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me. My wife made me take it out of the player in the car. "Good Vibrations" and "Heroes and Villains" realize the potential of the 60's versions and shine as the albums best cuts. Most of the rest of the album is unlistenable. It is Pet Sounds progressing to the next level (not a good thing) and almost sounds like a Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon" wanna be, only 35 years too late, and not as listenable
1	THIS IS THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK!!! Don't listen to the other reviewers this IS the original soundtrack for the film when Harry Met Sally. Buy it and enjoy it
1	The Renaissance of Modern Music Jazz, R&B, Rock, Soul, Funk, and Pop music had all existed before 1982, but when this album came out, it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today. From recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition, Jackson set the standards for it all. Hundreds of years from now, this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded. While Quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings, Jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Beat It", and "Billie Jean", songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s, and showed the world just how musical Michael could be. Aside from those recordings, master songwriter Rod Temperton ("Rock with You", "Off the Wall", "Always and Forever") and R&B soulman James Ingram contributed their own unique tracks, as well. From "Thriller" to "P.Y.T.", every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole. While some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history's catalogue, I have yet to come across any with as much quality, energy, diversity, and versatility as this one. A masterpiece
0	Great single, just NOT a great album Most upsetting about PORT OF MIAMI is that being a big fan of the organ-filled "Hustlin'", I was hoping that quality-wise the entire album would stand up to that brilliant for single. Unfortunate for the somewhat fortunate debut (#1 on the Billboard 200 with 187,000 copies sold), the album to put it bluntly stinks. Sure "Hustlin'" along with a generic repeat of Young Jeezy's massive "Soul Survivor" hit ("Cross The Line" which features nobody else by Konvikt Akon), are fine, but otherwise, Ross has more inhabitions than attributes. While idealy Ross should compete with new standouts such as Southern rapper Young Jeezy or T.I., or even more less known names such as Slim Thug or Bun B, he doesn't make the cut against any of those artist. In fact, Ross's gravely vocals tend to grate rather than inspire, all except on the opening tracks such as the above par "Push It", "Hustlin'", "Cross The Line", or "I'm Bad". Otherwise, Ross unfortunately falls on death ears. It makes you wonder that if Ross were to ever release a sophomore album, would it be successful? With such boasts made of him by Diddy and Jay-Z, mega hip-hop stars and talent-searchers, you wonder who dropped the ball with the excution of this star's album, which is terrible to say about any new artist. And without a true single tall enough to stand against the incredible but minor radio cut (it never did really well despite fan support) "Hustlin'", you wonder if after an impressive debut and support if the only way for Ross is down instead of up? No, I'm not putting Ross down, but I can't help but to say that I was expecting a meatier, Grammy worthy debut from Ross instead of the rather hit-absent PORT OF MIAMI. Does he rep good for Miami? Sure, but hopefully a second round will make Ross more mature and more likeable than a rather bland debut. 2 stars for the album, 4.5 for killer single "Hustlin'", a sure to be rap classic
1	Omarion's Review OMG When I heard he was comin got with an album after the whole B2K break-up, I was surprised as hell!. I brought it and love every single song except for "Never Gonna Let You Go" I dont like that song really. I love the album coming from a true B2K fan i thought it was gonna be like the same ol' B2K stuff but with 1 person but I was really surprised. He really matured on this album and I love it. Love You O
0	buy Kelly's album instead of this I never got through listening to this whole album... I bought it because I was a fan of Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini - but just hearing the first few minutes of Kelly's version of Respect, I lost interest. I don't recall ever putting the cd in the cd player after that time. So if you like Kelly and Justin, buy their albums instead
0	Would the real Sting please stand up? Is it just me, or do all Sting's new songs these days sound basically the same? I've loved Sting's quirky, compelling - and not infrequently erudite - songwriting and music-making as far back as I can remember, from early Police through to 'Ten Summoner's Tales' - but every time I listen to one of the newer albums, I just get a feeling of wading through formless aural goo that refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a distinctive voice or vision. I don't WANT Sting to make Part 2 of 'Turtles' or 'Summoner' (artists have to evolve and explore to be worth listening to) but I miss the clever playfulness of 'Englishman' or 'Heavy Cloud', the sombre poetry and sweeping thematic unity of the whole 'Soul Cages' album and the heartbreaking simplicity of 'Fragile' or 'Fields of Gold' - I miss the way the music and words *worked* together, and the way there was always one more thing lurking below the surface if you listened carefully enough, or a cleverer musical joke than you'd initially caught. The point is, 'Sacred Love', 'Brand New Day' - and even 'Mercury Falling' - could have been made by ANYONE - there just isn't anything that separates these songs (okay, except maybe 'Desert Rose' and 'Thousand Years') from easy listening elevator music, nothing that makes them Sting's and not just another faceless product that exists mainly as background to a slickly edited music video. Even the outrage seems carefully calibrated -'This War' is certainly no 'Russians' (even discounting the brilliantly quoted Prokofiev theme), and the extra verbiage is neither forceful nor intelligent enough to induce me to actually listen, as opposed to letting it play in the background. On the plus side, I am looking forward to getting hold of the new album of Elizabethan songs - Sting certainly has the musical smarts to take on such a challenge, and I'm keen to see how he handles the delivery of the music. But I'll still miss the old Sting - the one who could make me dive into a book to check a reference while simultaneously making music that always had something new to offer - and I'll continue to live in hope
0	The most loathsome song ever. I don't listen to the radio much. In fact, it would be closer to the truth to say that I actively AVOID listening to the radio, whenever possible. But it seems that no matter where I go, I can't escape the constant airplay of Green Day's megahit "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." I don't hate this song because it has a bland, repetitive structure, or because of the band's lackluster musical talents, or Billie Joe's grating vocals. Those are all valid reasons to hate "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" but my reason is my own: The lyrical content. Let's take a look, shall we? "I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known" Yeah, sure, whatever you say. Not only does Billie Joe have a wife of nearly twelve years, he also has numerous friends and MILLIONS of adoring fans throughout the world and was voted "Sexiest Rock Star" by Kerrang!, and suddenly he's telling me how lonely he is? He's probably never experienced one moment of true loneliness in his whole life! What kind of hypocrisy is this? The whole song is nothing but Billie Joe whining about how he walks alone and how he wishes "someone out there will find me" which comes out painfully contrived and insincere. "Oh, you're overreacting," you say. Well, maybe I am. But the truth is, I am violently sick of bands churning out shallow, meaningless drivel with some mopey lyrics to try to make money off of people's misery; and it's not just Green Day, either. Bands like Linkin Park, Evanescence, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, and many others all seem to be hooked on trying to parlay their so-called "loneliness" into their albums not because they really feel such emotions and wish to honestly express them, but because it sells albums. Misery isn't trendy. Songs like this and countless others aim for your pocketbook by pretending to "feel your pain." These hacks aren't worth a dime
0	this is WACK it deserves no stars I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mi
0	oh cocorosie sucks. They can't sing. And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song.
0	Over engineered fluff BeBe and CeCe demonstrate great comprimise in this sad collection of &quot;gospel&quot; songs because almost every cut can also be interpreted as a secular love song. Unlike a true gospel artist like Vickie Winans, who has the ability to evangalize through her music, these performers seem to be embarrassed about being inspirational. This disc is for the bubble gum Christian, not for the listener who takes his or her faith seriously
1	Lovely Lila!!! Lila Downs is by far the most amazing vocalist of our time. I have all her CD's and can't wait until the next. Her music and live shows are inspiring and moving. She's a Latina who keeps it real and is proud of who she is, where she comes from and where she's been. I had the honor of meeting her and her inner beauty surely compliments her outer beauty. Her talent is moving, and her humility inspiring. I recommend this CD 100% as well as all her others. Hear it for yourself... and catch her live performances when she's in your town
0	Best Punk Compilation Ever? I Beg To Differ! ):&lt; Let's get one thing strait: I am deffidently not a punk hater, and DEFFIDENTLY not an mtv loser fan. In fact, punk rock is my favorite type of music. But I did not like punk o rama volume 5. I just did not find it cool, catchy, or even ok. It sucked. The only songs I really liked were the Pennywise song and the Vision song(which is about being close minded, and I don't like people who are close minded), and the Pulley song was okay, though the singer's voice annoys the heck outta me. The rest is bland, unoriginal, and annoying. Even the Rancid song was annoing. Yes, you heard me right. Everyone's so-called favorite punk band's song was annoying. At Borders, I had the choice between this and AFI's All Hollows E.P. I now know better than that. If you liked this CD, fine. Just remember to buy good punk CDs from bands like The Distillers, Misfits, The Ramones, Offspring, Rise Against, and early AFI, out of respect for good punk
1	Hope you're feeling better... This is the Santana &quot;best of&quot; for people who don't need a collection of songs that can be heard on any classic rock station within minutes of tuning in. The deeper tracks from Abraxus included here are more than worth while
0	A shoddy monument to a great artist's 80th year. Five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value. Value??? At around $135 this box set to mark Tony Bennett's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan / collector, rather than at the casual buyer. With that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that Sony/Columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special? What we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag. Firstly, the packaging. The picture on Amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set, as the finished product is more elaborate. The box is a cube covered in black velour with Bennett's signature embossed into the top. The front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer. Behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos, set slightly back from the panel to give a 3D effect. Above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with Bennett's signature. In the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small, hard backed book of approximately 60 pages, again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer's signature. Contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief (and I do mean brief) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set. All very nice, but as a fan of the music I would have prefered recording information, anectdotes about the original album releases, session details, etc. At approximately 7.5" x 7.5" x 7.5", the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your CDs. OK - so what about what we really came here for, namely, the music? This is where the above mentioned frustration comes in. Let's take it album by album. First of all there are several already available CDs, but in digitally remastered form, some with and some without bonus tracks. These are: I Left My Heart In San Francisco - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release. The Art of Excellence - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release. Perfectly Frank - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release. MTV Unplugged - Two bonus cuts ("Just a Little Street Where Old Friends Meet" / "When Will the Bells Ring for Me?") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release. The Movie Songs - Two bonus cuts ("A Time for Love" / "The Shining Sea") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release. Then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of "pointless" as they have already been available for some time, already previously remastered: Cloud Seven - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality. The Beat of My Heart - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality. If I Ruled the World: Songs for the Jet Set - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality. The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album - An even more puzzling inclusion. Not a Columbia release, but recorded for the Fantasy label in the '70s. This is the original Fantasy CD release, not even repackaged for the box set by Columbia. It's just as if they bought a bunch of these from Fantasy and popped them into this collection. However, and again frustratingly, this is NOT the 20 Bit remastered edition of this CD that has been available for several years but the non-remastered, sonically inferior release from the late '90s. Perhaps Fantasy had a few thousand of these that they couldn't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on Sony/Columbia? Whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set, to say the least. Next is one album already previously released and remastered, but here in a slightly amended form. I Wanna Be Around - No noticeable difference in sound quality, but with different bonus cuts from the previous release. The previous CD release of this album included as a bonus, seven tracks from the "This Is All I Ask" album, a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition, as all of the tracks from "This Is All I Ask" would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release. For the box set release we have three different bonus tracks "If I Love Again" (alternate take) / "Someone To Love" (alternate take) / "Indian Summer". So - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your (now deleted) previous CD release of this album. The next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless: The Singles Collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan and not the casual buyer (casual buyers don't drop $135 on a whim), another "Greatest Hits" variant is completely pointless. Something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc, probably several times over. Heaven forbid Sony/Columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this, their umpteenth hits compilation. Finally, two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans. Tony Bennett Sings for Two - Briefly available on CD many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason. This remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release. When Lights are Low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on CD (so far as I can ascertain). An absolute gem. More of this type of album -i.e. never before available on CD- is what this collection needed. So - what do we have at the end of the day for the Bennett faithful? One previously unavaiable on CD release and one long unavailable on CD album, three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in, one album in an inferior version to what is already available, one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release, five albums with remastered sound (two with bonus cuts) and, finally, one totally pointless "hits" collection. Considering that approximately thirty Tony Bennett albums have never had a CD release, many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults, this collection is a completely botched undertaking, a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man's 80th birthday. Just exactly who executive producer Danny Bennett and Sony/Columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery. If it is the dedicated fan, then I have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums, a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $135. Just what are the chances, I wonder, of Tony Bennett's back catalogue making it to CD before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves? This is a sorry monument to a great artist's 80th year. (AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set, namely, thirteen. Not a dozen, not twenty. but thirteen. Go figure. You know what they say about the number 13 - "...unlucky for some...". In this case the unlucky ones are Mr Bennett's fans.)
0	Petra doesn't want to grow up Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered.
0	Seperating the Tracks Would Have Been Nice! I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD. Was also disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own. This album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.
1	I love the Legacy version I am one of the people who got the album when it originally came out. I had it memorized. When it first came out on CD, I was disapoointed. I had noticed that quite a bit of it was cut, especially the bit he talks about before the VSM. However, when I found that the Legacy CD came out. I had to buy it. Boy, I have not been disappointed. It is great. It is even better because they have added some songs that were not even on the original CD.
1	Enjoying It This is the kind of CD that you don't skip over any tracks on. You can't help but to knod your head and tap your fingers to each beat and imagine being in a small intimate venue hearing the songs being played live. Most of the songs are kind of fast. Great driving CD. Favorite Tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 and you gotta love track 13 (also on his previous CD).
0	All Hype I bought this album because I am so into Sigur Ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews I read say that "...if you like Sigur Ros you will like MBV.." Let me say this album is no where near a Sigur Ros experience. If I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser. It would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. The sound quality is comparable to some old VHS tapes I have from the mid 80's that I recorded off the TV ( Then soaked in water for a few days!) .
0	Overpriced WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier
0	Hillbilly What? ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs "Believe" and "I'm Building Bridges". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!
1	This album is near perfect. This and Dark Side of the Moon are the most balanced records Pink Floyd has ever produced. Just the right amount of sax, synth, drums, guitar, and vocals. The album is a little different than their ealier stuff as it has mostly a possitive sound to it, in other words don't come from the Wall listening to this without giving it some time. The only thing in question really are the "A New Machine" tracks, which are certainly different, not something you would just jump into. Will you ever like them if you don't like them inittially? Probably not. But other than that, everything else is utter perfection for the style of music they represent. Listen to this album a few times and trust me, you'll love it
0	Kind of a drag, really Note to soundtrack producers: When we buy a soundtrack with a bunch of good songs, we want to hear the songs. Sure, a bunch of dialog scattered throughout is fine and fun, but not when it's cut into the music! (See the soundtrack to "Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back" for how to do it right.) Basically, what they've done here, is try to create some new experience that isn't quite the movie and isn't quite the soundtrack. You don't get to hear the full versions of the songs as the artists recorded them. The beginnings and the ends are crossfaded together with snippets of dialog. It's like a soundtrack/radio drama hybrid with no plot. The dialog runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, which runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, etc., throughout the entire CD. On the first listen, you think, "Oh, yeah, Ed complaining that the zombie blew the call-and-response in 'White Lines.' That was funny...," but then you're kind of screwed for the rest of your life because the editors have mixed in the boys doing their, "...diggeda, diggeda, diggeda..." bit right into the middle of the song. If you truly want to hear 'White Lines' or any of the other tunes, you'll have to get them elsewhere. Sorry. I'm not sure what the objective was with this disc, but if I wanted to relive the movie, I'd pop in the DVD. If I wanted to hear the songs, I would have liked to have played the CD, but that won't work here. The songs and the movie dialog on this CD are like Siamese twins sharing a single stomach. You get one, you get the other and there's no separating them. This is a bummer since they're good songs. What I've got now is a CD novelty that I really can't use. I may trot it out once a year, but I'll be disappointed every time. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay..
1	Welcome, but Uneven, Comeback It is difficult to rate and review 'Time Out of Mind,' Bob Dylan's start to a string of late Renaissance achievements. The album, which is named after Mercutio's line before Romeo crashes the Capulets' masquerade ball in 'Romeo and Juliet, 'finds Dylan "Love Sick" with a world that has gone wrong and left him bewildered. These subject matters are deftly taken up with the blues with his excellent new band and Daniel Lanois at the producer helm and Jack Frost just in the wings. The highlights are hallmark. Even though his voice has aged and is more gravelly, it does appropriately remind one of Leon Redbone, which suits his new endeavors well. "Love Sick" is thick and bottom-line. With some hefty guitar chords he sings his heart out. Then, he comes up with "Dirt Road Blues," arguably the C.D.'s best song. With what can be described as rockabilly blues, he and his band transport us to the Texas border for some hot chili. "Starting in the Doorway" reminds us of his vintage work. Sometimes this number gets as langorous, however, like the "...summer night..." he walks through. Similarly, "Million Miles" is good blues, even if the title tells us much about the length of the destination. "Trying to Get to Heaven" and the beautifully shimmering "Not Dark Yet," really hit the spot with two of his top songs here. Also worthy of his latter legacy is the celebrated ballad, "Make You Feel My Love," which is as eloquent and substantial as his best love songs. Also good quality can be found with the heavy "Cold Irons Bound". This song lingers a bit too long, but especially the closer, "Highlands," doesn't come close to reaching the destination and isn't close to climbing to the heights of a classic like "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". 'Time Out of Mind' was able to capture enough attention by landing Dylan on the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine. He deserved it anyway, but this album is a mixed comeback, providing some disapointment despite the hype. In spots he delivers his old genius in a different venue, but 'Oh, Mercy,' before it, and 'Modern Times,' after it demonstrate that there are a lot of Dylan classics to be found more worthy than 'Time Out of Mind'
1	Solid This is his weakest attempt but it is still very good and consistent throughout the album. Now why is it his worst because it sounds too commercial for me and that is my opinion and other people will say otherwise. I like almost every song here but I skip about 4 of them and the rest I can listen to all the way through. I recommend this album to fans of down south music and maybe rap fans in general but most rap fans probably never heard of him and most are skeptic but I recommend it
0	Not Even Worth "Rent"ing It's tough not to surpass judgment on the ruinous film when attempting to evaluate the soundtrack of `Rent' because the big screen adaptation was as intolerable as countless nonsensical movie tie-ins that MTV used to excel at force-feeding down our throats. But what exactly is missing from this recording? Well, while it's hard to pinpoint, it is so easy to comprehend. There is no joy - no hope - no struggle in the mechanized performances. We don't experience the lyrics, we remain unmoved by the static orchestration - each musical number is executed as stoically as a soundtrack should not be presented - on stage, such enunciation and bombast is called for; in a film there is room for embellishment - and restraint. Here, there is none - only aging players, too old for their roles, caterwauling mind-numbing denunciations and explorations. What `Rent' lacks is a timeless score, despite its cult status. While some tracks retain their original prettiness, more often than not we are assaulted with Jim Steinman-like pomposity from a cast that can't seem to project over the deafening drum machine. If you must revel in `Rent', dole out the cash for the original cast recording. At least there's Daphne Rubin-Vega. My grade: C-
0	Not as great as said by most Yeah i read the reviews on how great this album is. Dont get me wrong its unique but that doesnt mean im gonna feel it. Im sure some underground head is gonna read this and trip and write a review dissin me. So let me tell you there is just as much fake ass artists in the underground as mainstream. So dont discriminate mainstream and underground. Give mainstream a chance. You might like it. I dont even talk about whats what anymore. I like Outkast, The Game, and some G Unit that doesnt make me a "a non true hip hop head". Oh yeah back to the album. I really didnt like it cuz it was borin and left me thinking about other things. Im mad that i bought this cd. I will give him a 2 star for effort though. Heed my words majority kids
0	Stick with the original soundtracks Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies. You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks. These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams
0	a mix of old and new...more new This sounds a lot like 'Out of time', but not quite as good in some respects. 'Pop song 89' is a perfect opening to the album, it moves along nicely and is pretty catchy. Other highlights include 'World Leader Pretend', with nice percussion and steel guitars. There are three acoustic songs which began kind of a theme on the next couple of albums. 'You are the everything' to me has absolutely no melody and moves along rather boringly. 'The wrong child' attempts to utilise harmony vocals. They are completely out of key with each other. Another poor effort. The high 'OKAYYYY' parts are unbelievably out of tune. 'Hairshirt' is third cut in the same vein as the previous two. Same chordal structure without much melody going on anywhere. Clearly, the ballads needed to be perfected. 'Orange Crush' is a more catchy tune. Mike Mills can also be heard in the chorus and, at the risk of sounding controversial, he actually has a better voice. Much purer. Why he did not sing any lead until the next album, is just unbelievable. Probably the strongest track. The best way of summing up this album is that it consists of three types of songs... 1) The Pop songs - Pop song 89 (good), Get up (ok), Stand (rubbish), The bonus cut (ok and catchy) 2) The ballads - Mentioned above, all rubbish. 3) The rock songs - World leader Pretend (good - toes line of being a ballad also), I remember California (grundgy, not too bad), Orange Crush (very good), Turn you inside out (rubbish
0	Why? Why? ...Words, Lover's Prayer, To Love Somebody...why? I was pleased to hear Juliet again but resinging Barry's leads is a mistake. Would have loved to hear the brothers together doing a tribute album to Mo instead. When I look at this album, all I can say is "Why?
0	Lil' Kim...notorious for making horrid music. Biggie put her on the map. Why, i'll never know. So she sucked off the fame he gave her (not the only thing she's been sucking) Also, being a Biggie fan, the name of this cd (proving my point about Biggie) was offensive and disrespectful. This is not rap, this is pop. If you think this is rap, you need to get smacked with a "The Lost Children of babylon" album and learn real rap. Nothing but two dollar trash by a two dollar wh*re
1	Awesome! Jesus &amp; Mary Chain have 2 sets of fans, those who like the feedback drenched &quot;Psychocandy&quot;. And the rest of us, who like everything after. &quot;Automatic&quot; is full of 50's - 60's guitar style rockers played in the JMC way. Perhaps, one little flaw is the drum machine. But you can't deny the sheer power of &quot;Her way of praying&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Blues from a gun&quot; and the classic &quot;Head on&quot;. Without all the feedback, the songs really come out! They made it a point to stray away from &quot;Psychocandy&quot;'s sound alltogether and sort of reinvented themselves, pissing off their early fans. (Like the reviewer before me). The band made that very clear with the title of their next great album &quot;Honey's dead&quot; in 1992. Get it
1	Short changed Excellent album, great songs, beautiful bluegrass voice and some really fine backing muscicians, so why am I left unsatisfied? The total total track length is only 34 minutes! Thats not good value for my purchase, most albums run for 40-50 minutes. Nice album - shame about the length
0	I didn't think that they could get any gayer..(is that a word? Gayer???) Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it
0	where is vnv, this is not vnv I am very dissapointed with this album, it has not the mistyc of VNV. I suppose that this was only a mistake of these musician stars. I will wait the next release.
0	1-1/2 stars -- Dumb, dry and trashy First things first: this compilation shouldn't even be called Jermaine Dupri Presents... because JD is only involved with two songs on here (he stars in "Gotta Getcha", and he produces one other song). Anyway, I'm not exactly sure what possessed him to put together Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1; whether he was just thinking about "the way we were", or if he just wanted to showcase some new young talent. Actually, maybe I shouldn't have said the latter, because it looks like JD dug up some of the most UNtalented people ever. But things aren't very inspiring with the known artists, like when J-Kwon and Daz try to save "10 Toes". And I wonder how long ago that song was made because in it, J-Kwon says he's 17, but that's how old he was when "Tipsy" came out. I don't know WHY JD decided to dig up has-beens KP & Envyi for the dismal "Put Cha Hands Up" (that title even sounds like it came from 1997), and as for "I Think They Like Me", if it's really Dem Franchize Boyz' song, how come they're the only ones in there that can't rap? Most of the rappers on here are unknowns, but in the end they really aren't WORTH knowing because even JD is a better rapper than they are. Miss B's "Grown Man" suffers from a corny chorus, and T. Waters' "Throw'd Off" is just plain wack. And Cato's lazy "So What" made me say just that. But the album's nadir is the title track, performed by Young Capone, Midnight, Champagne Shawty and C-Dirt. Not only is there lackluster production, but the guys' rapping is so bad that they make Chingy look like Rakim. The only saving grace to this whole compilation is Bun-B's verse on the otherwise terrible "Kodak Moment". Unlike that title, though, this album isn't anything to remember. If Jermaine ever makes a Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 2, I'll be the first person not to get it. Anthony Ruper
1	Best of the Best This cd is full of emotion, and a lot of fun! It's like a great story in 10 awesome songs! 1. "Get Stoned" takes you back to (or reminds you of) your teenage years of love. 2. "How Long" shows the ache of a break up, and how much it hurts to have someone else with the person you love. 3. "By the Way" takes you to a place where everyone has/will be one day, wanting everything to be your way, and perfect. 4. "Nothin' Good About Goodbye" relates how hard it is to finally cut your love off, and how every time you try to end it, they just keep coming back. 5. "Bliss (I Don't Wanna Know)" about the way you try and try to make everything work out and how you really don't want to know it's the end. 6. "Better Than Me" is about the realization that you really miss someone but that they deserve much more than what you have to give. 7. "Room 21" a great song about a day at a bar that leads to a great night!! 8. "Lips Of An Angle" a very emotional song about two people that were in a relationship and are still there for each other. they still wish they were together. 9. "Homecoming Queen" a song about a girl that is missing, someone that everyone took for granted! 10. "Shoulda" very great song to end the cd with! it is about not saying those 3 little words and wanting to change it!! This cd is a must buy!!! no matter what kind of music your into.. it is an awesome cd that relates to everyday happenings... it is the best that rock has to offer!!!
1	Intens, hard-rocking, original. Up till now my favorite Chris Whitley album was Dirt Floor. There's another favorite now; this latest album by the late great floor-stomping singer is raw and rocking with a twist. The hard drive works to perfection in combination with a souring violin. Buy this CD and if you do not own a copy of Dirt Floor buy that one tw
1	An excellent CD!!!! "Looking Up" is absoulutley wonderful! Every single song is great. Gregg Karukas is simply smooth jazz finest musician. This CD is extremley enjoyable and creative
1	Hellogoodbye scores with Debut CD Hellogoodbye has recently become one of my favorite new bands. They have a unique emo sound , with a touch of techno . The best tracks on their Debut " Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs!", in my opinion are their first single " Here (in your arms)", " Baby , It's Fact" , " Touchdown Turnaround (don't give up on me) " , and " All of your love" . Their lyrics are just plain catchy , and their songs vary throughout the album . Some are loud , and some are soft love songs . Out of all the songs on the album , I can totally see Touchdown Turnaround as their next single . It's a great song , with really fun lyrics . If your a fan of Bright Eyes , you'll like this band . For some reason , they remind me of them in some songs . It's a fun CD that can be played over and over again.
0	Boring I cant say i especially like any of the songs on this album. All of them are incredibly repetitive. If you like aphex's repetitive stuff, buy it, otherwise buy one of his better albums, like Richard D. James or Drukq
0	NOT THAT GOOD I AM DISAPPOINTED OF THIS CD BECAUSE FRED HAMMOND AND RFC IS OFF THE CHAIN BUT THIS CD IS NOT. I REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT BECUASE THEY HAVE DONE BETTER AND THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY IT THEN YOU CAN BUT I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT. THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT ARE GOOD BUT THE REST ARE WEA
1	Scott's Review [jassiel2001@hotmail.com] Commissioned. One of the greatest groups of all time. Really gives it to you with this album. With lush flowing ballads such as,&quot;Do You Still Love Me&quot; and,&quot;Crucified With Christ.&quot; This album also gives you bangin' joints such as,&quot;Irreplaceable Love&quot; and, &quot;I Can Love Agin.&quot; This CD gives you all that you need, and will really help you with your walk with Christ. This is the year 2001, and I still rate this album(done in 1996)number one out of all my music I have at home. In church or out of church, I encurage you to buy this album. You wont be disapointed
1	A 'Real Good' and 'Intimate' Live Album When the Corrs deliver it 'live', they deliver it real good. Whether it is 'covers' or 'originals', it is as good a live album as I have heard. The intimacy with the audience is evident and all the songs stand-up well 'live'. In my view, this is the best 'Corrs' album out there. Bono pops up on two tracks as an added bonus
1	The Good Stuff By far, this is AFI's greatest release, period, if you don't like it, go kiss Raf. "No Dave Party" is an effing great instrumental track, if ya don't know where it is, ya better start looking for it. Every single song on this album is perfect, this is my favorite album of all time. This is the last album with the classic line-up and how fitting that it's their best, no? Geoff went on to play in Tiger Army, he left them and is now in HorrorPops. Geoff's bass playing is superb on this, the Good Stuff to say the least. Mark's guitar playing is pretty good, and Adam's drumming is the fast stuff. Now, good old Davey, the DXH. People will complain and say "He sounds like he's on elium" and that "His voice is too high". Well, the man was 20 when he recorded this, what d'ya expect? The lyrics are really good too, if you look closely, it's got some pretty good straight edge stuff on it. Then it's got the typical outcast, teen fury stuff. If you're a pissed off teenager and dig the real hardcore stuff-7 Seconds, Minor Threat, Black Flag, etc.-not that fraudcore Atreyu, From First To Last crap you should get this. So yeah, best album ever, buy it. JX
0	Go buy a Sinatra album Every singer has his song, on this album Robbie nails Beyond The Sea and the rest of the songs suck. Louis Armstrong nailed Mack the Knife and Frank Sinatra nailed It Was A Very Good Year. Robbie William does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs. Sorry. Hope you did not purchase this album. You can get the Finding Nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has Beyond the Sea on it
0	Different? NOPE, its the same stupid Cold. Yeah, this is metal madness!! Scooter delivers such gruesome lyrics and vocals, the two guitarists do psychotic shredding riffs and blazing solos, the drummer does machine gun double bass at 400 miles per second!! Metal is revived!! As you can see, I'm joking. Scooter has little baby squirel nuts, hence his super weak and annoying voice. His lyrics about "I hate my parents, my daddy touched my privates" tripe is nothing new, and nothing pleasing to the ears. The guitarists are very bad, they're downtuned and they only do powerchords and don't solo (because they can't). The drummer is very basic, nothing special. Bass? Can't hear it. Want the best album of 2005? Go for "Ghost Reveries" by Opeth. Opeth cares about music, Cold only cares about fame and money.
0	What's become of the Great American Songbook? Oo God, one more time! This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series. Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully. I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture. More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way. That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead.
0	Dear hipster: why read this review -- you're going to buy it anyway When I saw the Futureheads at Chicago's Empty Bottle in 2004, it was a revelation of jumproping vocal harmonies, savage guitar abuse and anthemic absurdity. The band's self-titled debut album was just as exciting. The Futureheads have barely stopped touring since, and it shows. All of their technical craft remains evident on News & Tributes, but there are few if any memorable moments. The songwriting just isn't there. And believe me: the band knows it. At this year's Pitchfork festival, they played perhaps three songs from N&T, choosing to lean on the older, tighter, hookier material. Want a great new rock album? Go Buy the Tokyo Police Club EP.
1	Beethoven Rediscovered!!!!! I was curious to listen to David Zinman and the Zurich Orchestra after all I had read in the CD guide books and magazines. This is my sixth full cycle (Karajan 1963 and 1977, Klemperer,Bernstein/VPO and Toscanini) and these days is definetely my favourite. Zinman brings new life to the symphonies- period. The Barenreiter edition may play a role in the freshness of the music but the passion of maestro and orchestra makes you feel as if you are present in the music hall, being a spectator of a live performance. The first symphonies were the greatest surprise for me, and I can now see the maturation of Beethoven, where as the older approaches interepreted these pieces as small "Eroicas". There is no doubt there are better interepretations of individual symphonies out there - ex. Carlos Kleiber on the 5th, Klemperer on the "Eroica"-old style or Furtwangler on the 1952 recording of the "Choral" - but this fact can not overshadow what I find as an excellent set at a great price
1	Brilliant. Ineffably singular. You think you've heard these symphonies before, but the combination of a smaller orchestra and period instrumentation with ur-text orchestrations makes these recordings a revelation. Not the least of the set's pleasures is Zinman's respecting of the real tempi called for in the scores - at times a tad faster than they're usually played - which strips the music of the ponderous heaviness that too often creeps in. One reviewer loved the whole set except for the Fifth, and I can understand why - the Fifth here sounds unlike you've ever heard it before. I'd say, having listened, that's a good thing. The best bargain in classical recordings this year
0	That Does It... I'm Bout To Drop Me A Album This is a good example of rap today. You don't need to be a MC to land a deal, or even know how to rhyme. All you need to do is come up with a dance move, make songs about your damn clothes and how you party all the time and your on. This ain't right man... it just ain't right !!
0	what were they thinking? I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that
1	JLP's last really good disc 1977's "Enigmatic Ocean" was indeed a tough act to follow, given the improvisational and sonic brilliance of one Allan Holdsworth on guitar. So, instead of trying to replicate that disc, Ponty wisely leaned more in a rockier/funky direction for "Cosmic Messenger", knowing that NOBODY could match Holdsworth's unique contributions or even get close. What results is a collection of songs that retain a lot of the characteristics of Ponty's earlier efforts but a bit leaner and meaner sounding. Of the 2 guitarists, Peter Maunu definitely comes up the most distinct sounding with his soaring melodic bluesy rock sound. What I really enjoyed though was the huge punchy sounding rhythm section of drummer Casey Schurrel and bassist Ralphe Armstrong (I especially loved Ralphe's huge thick growling fretless tone here, deeeeeelicious!). Allan Zavod provides all the appropriately spacey textures with a bank of synths. Have to admit though I would've loved to hear more acoustic instruments as well to balance it out, as it was a bit synth/electronics heavy. As for the highlights, "Ethereal Mood" is beautifully hypnotic with not much more than acoustic violin, chiming acoustic guitars, fretless bass and tablas, very beautiful haunting melody. On the funkier/rocky side, "Art of Happiness", "Don't Let The World Pass You By" and "Fake Paradise" come out swinging. The one low point for me is the ending tune "Egocentric Molecules" (corny title BTW!), which sounds more like a mathematical exercise more than it does music. Not one of Ponty's better compositional moments in this Owl's opinion. Overall, a solid album worth having, but not groundbreaking by any stretch. After this, JLP would seem to just keep making the same record over and over again
0	The second star is for persistance While not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow, this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four. Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame!
0	Inner thoughts from a hollow man. Imagine no possessions? Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces. Imagine no religion? Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit. Imagine no countries? Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador. The world will be as one? Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most. John Lennon was a text book phony. He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't. Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now. The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation. His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn. Thank you very much. -DW.
1	Read the Review (4.5 Stars) I write this review of "The Documentary" as The Game's sophomore release "Doctor's Advocate" prepares to be let loose on the populous. In January of 2005 The Game was let loose for the first time as he delivered his debut album "The Documentary" on Aftermath/G-Unit records. It was a much hyped and much anticipated release. As it dropped universal praise was hefted upon The Game for the record that was sonically spectacular and showed a revived west coast. Lyrically some people hated on The Game for name dropping so much, I won't lie sometimes it's a little tiresome, but as an obsessive hip hop nerd I like to hear people rap about hip hop. Its fun to figure out the connections they are trying to make and in all honesty it's nice to know that at least one artist in this game actually knows his history and respects the architects of our culture. Pretty quickly after the release it all started to fall apart. The Game and his boss at G-Unit, 50 Cent, seemed to already be on shaky ground before the release, but upon the release it seemed everything was all good internally between the two camps with 50's hooks all over the album along with several guest verses and Game's screams of "G-UNIT!" always keeping you aware of who was responsible for this project. Then all of a sudden it seemed it came crashing down. Game wouldn't ride with the Unit on their beef with Nas - he was out. We didn't really care because those of us who already had the record saw the talent that the kid had and we had "The Documentary" to prove it. The record continued to grow and went on to sell an absurd amount of records. I got to say good on The Game because listening to "The Documentary" it's obvious he put a lot of work into this album and that it meant a lot to him. He likes to talk about his life and what he's been through to get to this point of releasing his debut record. He likes to praise his influences. But most of all he likes hip hop. So as I look back at "The Documentary" almost 2 years later I can't help but feel what he's saying. It's the truth of that time in his life. Sure Game is cocky and seems confused and or lost with his life right now, but the one thing that he does know is hip hop and he knows how to write verses. If you don't have "The Documentary" you need this record if for no other reason to see a young man grow. Without "The Documentary" you will not understand "Doctor's Advocate" (which I'll write a review for sooner than 2 years!), the record that will prove he did grow up and doesn't need anyone's help, 50 or Dre (trust me I've heard it). "The Documentary" may not be a classic but it's damn good and deserves a place in not just your hip hop collection but in your music collection as this is an album that goes beyond the definition of genre and is just music at its simplest form.
1	The Documentary Excellent cd..every track worth downloading...well excluding the intro outro things.This is how i rate each track. The only dud is don't worry, game hardly raps at all on that track the rest are good, some are great, and some are classics!!(Higher, Put You On The Game, How We Do, We Ain't, Westside Story). All in all an incredible debut album...I've already heard a track from games next album, The Doctors Advocate, and I can tell you he is not gonna have a sophmore slump..It's gonna be hot! Get this and some mixtaps to tide you over till november 7th. Intro Westside Story-10/10 Dreams-6/10 Hate It Or Love It-7/10 Higher-10/10 How We Do-10/10 Don't Need Your Love-5/10 Church For Thugs-7/10 Put You On The Game-10/10 Start From Stcratch-7/10 The Documentary-6/10 Runnin'-6/10 No More Fun And Games-8/10 We Ain't-10/10 Where I'm From-8/10 Special-6/10 Don't Worry-4/10 Like Father Like Son-7/10 Outr
0	Meh. Basically, I think they sold out on this soundtrack. Alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing (for example, Sum 41's Makes No Difference, Mest's What's The Dillio, Bis' Detour (Do You Wanna Go My Way?)) and instead, we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes. Now, if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety, it would be different. But instead we are left with a bunch of, quite honestly, mediocre songs
1	A FEW GREAT SONGS! AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is one of METALLICAS BEST ALBUMS...I DONT REALLY LIKE THE LYRICS IN BLACKENED THAT MUCH, I MEAN I LIKE THE SONG BLACKENED. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS IS EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!! TITLE IS GREAT, BUT TOO LONG!! GET THIS WITH 5 OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS LIKE BLACK, MASTER OF PUPPETS, RIDE THE LIGHTNING, RELOAD, AND LOAD
0	Worst Band In The World I can't believe that I'm NOT ALLOWED to give this zero stars. This band is garbage. The record is worse than garbage. It's septic sludge. The music is unoriginal, cloying and boring. The vocals are the most annoying sound I've ever heard. I wish the courts would gag and restrain this band. This band couldn't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb. Boycott
1	Stevie's Double Crowning Achievement! I'm one of those reviewers that rarely rates music that hasn't touched me in one way or another. So when I felt that I wanted to write a review for a Stevie Wonder album, I ended up struggling over which of his great releases I should review. I love ALL of his mid-seventies releases....most notably, "Innervisions", "Fullfillingness...", and, of course, "Songs...". I guess I finally decided to 'tackle' this one based on its historical significance to the art of Music. For one, Stevie was "coming into his own" as far as musical expression and social commentary within his songs. Other than the great Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye, Stevie was at the forefront of writing about the joys, pains, positives and negatives of Human exsistance on Earth...and he did it very well. Songs such as "Village Ghetto Land", "Pastime Paradise", "Saturn" and "Have a Talk with God" among others, were as powerful 'messages' one could experience through a set of speakers. Secondly, He was able to finally gain TOTAL control of his musical vision from Motown and Berry Gordy....even more so than Marvin had done with "Whats Going On"...and this TOTAL control shows most prevelant on "Songs" than any previous release leading up to this one(IMO). There's certainly a little bit of everything on "Songs"---- the joy of life on "Isn't She Lovely"; black man's contributions to evolution in "Black Man"; World Love and Peace in "I am Singing"; the joys and pains of childhood in "I Wish"; Spiritual guidance in "Have a talk with God"; Desperation in the World's Ghettos in "Village Ghetto Land" , and even some "Props" to Mr. Ellington in "Sir Duke". One could literally go on like this for every song on this double album....Yes, very moving, significant statements indeed! As for the actual music and musicians, they are "all over the board" here (and Stevie certainly plays his share of the instruments, however, not as exstinsively as past albums). Every musician involved in "Songs" played exactly what each track called for, and, at the same time, still managed to put their 'mark' on these great cuts. The listener will be happy to find mellow, introspective songs...Upbeat, funky rockers...Spanish-tinged music....and even Stevie's brand of Fushion (Contusion)... Overall, A wonderful assortment of musical styles and genres mixed into one of the most important double LPs ever released. As a closing note, I am somewhat of a new-comer to this great artist, and yes, I am white. However, I feel this is one of a handful of artists that crosses/bridges ALL ethnic groups...weather black, white, yellow, or red. Please don't let the color of your skin (or Stevie's) stop you from experiencing some of the most important 'Art' ever produced. Strongly recommended, along with any other releases from this Genius
0	What a horrible album Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star). But it's quite called for here. CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!! Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album. Average production. Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content. The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose. An amateur job all around. It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape. There's definitely growing pains all throughout. Skip to his later selection
0	Great music, only one cd. Reason for my rating is the fact I only got one cd. I mean, 51 bucks for one cd is messed up. I guess I bought it after reading the reviews hoping the cd had like a bonus disc inside that they didn't put on the description... oh well. If you got the money and would like to own atleast ONE of the cd of this album, buy it
0	Disappointed Not the type of music I had envisioned...much slower than I was hoping for.
0	too much of a good thing don't just automatically hit "not helpful" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinoi
1	Real country This is what country music lacks today, the passion of John Anderson. All these mindless, &quot;popcountry&quot; songs are no match for ANY song by John Anderson
0	Buyers Beware These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent. "Totally Buble" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called "Totally Blonde" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him. It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album." - Michael Buble
0	If your heart beats more than once an hour, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more! Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band. I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country. I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis. When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ... I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word "Nothing" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party. You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader? I mean the kind of song that makes you think "Whoa! Who's THIS?!" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song "Out of Range" would do in less than 16 seconds. Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called "Wishful Thinking") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL! I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: "ZEIT". That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear. As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring. I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves "WOW! These guys are On FIRE! I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!" Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song "Next Time I Fall In Love" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's? In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than "Paranoid" by Black Sabbath. Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest. Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, "Oh yeah? Well, let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!" I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you. Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof. AAAaaannnnnd ... CUT! That's a wrap
0	Brainwashed Anthem for the Neo-Conservatives Wow. Where do I even begin? It is sad to think that so many Americans are as misinformed about Iraq and the war on terror as this Darryl Worley is. First off, I don't know anyone who is saying "you shouldn't worry about Bin Laden." If anything people against the war in Iraq wanted our government to spend more time and efforts tracking down al-Qaeda's leader. The fact that Bush Jr. will not make the hunt for Bin Laden his #1 priority is one of the many reasons why millions of Americans voted for Kerry. They want a leader who will stand up and protect us from the mastermind who attacked us and not send us on a wild goose chase like what Bush Jr. has unfortunatly done. Think for once Darryl! Next, if you are going to write a song about invading Iraq at least make references to it. Also, now that the war in Iraq and our president's approval ratings are so low. I doubt Darryl Worley would ever make a sequel song about staying the course in Iraq. He and his managers are probably thinking about the next tragedy to cash in on. Hmmmm maybe he will $ing about Hurricane Katrina next... We have spent so-far 500 billon dollars and more than that worth in human life lost in Iraq, all that in a war that "ended" according to our president on May 1, 2003. Perhaps, outsourcing jobs to other countries should be extended to crappy songwriters too.
0	Tanning with your eyes open wide! This album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating, and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere. Pacific is simple in its structure; and for the most part is listenable. At timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums, but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge. Overall I'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach, or some other equally applicable deviation. The group includes Lucas Jensen, clay, and Howard Hudson, and is currently playing shows to support the release.

1	A Defining Moment In '90's Punk The brilliance of the work on the early Bad Religion albums (Suffer, No Control and Against The Grain) is that it manages to be simultaneously delicate yet undeniably coarse. In terms of the lyrics, they can't get much more intricate, and yet they retain a hardened edge laced with a characteristically punk sense of discontent, which makes for a perfect balance. Vocally and musically the Bad Religion of Against The Grain are far more raw than they are they are currently, but there is still a sharpness which ensures that their raw edge does not make them come across as simply sloppy. Highlights include Anesthesia - with Brett doing what he does best and delving fearlessly into realm of the deeply troubled individual, and Greg furiously spitting social criticisms via his seamless polysyllabic approach in Get Off and Quality and Quantity. God Song is another gem which sits comfortably in the company of other Bad Religion tracks questioning the nature of religion, such as Chimaera and Generator, which are arguably some of their most effective songs. It's inconceivable that the boys will once again achieve the kind of punk perfection they did with this album, (and with Generator and Stranger Than Fiction) so no self-respecting punk should hesitate buying a copy of Against The Grain. It is a classic which effectively helped to define the genre of 90's punk rock
0	What were they thinking? Man, I can't believe Cold, Weezer, and Unwritten Law actually stooped to the level of doing something like this. All the other bands, I can see it, but these guys are way too good to have anything to do with the WWF! 2 stars for a phenomenal new Cold song, but why oh why does it have to be here
0	What? Why Ok so now Metallica decides Hey lets ripe off some more people because we can't do our own stuff without it sucking! You do know that Dave from Megadeth wrote all of there good songs. Without Dave around they sucked!!!!! I have sat down and tryed to rock out with this one because one of friends had it and I would just like to for the most part this thing sucks!!!! The Misfit's song they did was the worst cover ever!!!!! Hell COF does a way better cover of a Misfit song. If your looking for some band like to make money off of other peoples work then get any of there cd's. Now if your looking for some real metal then go get everything from Slayer, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu, and even COF because these bands are way better then anything they have ever put out!!
1	Truly, A "Timeless" Album!! Boy,when I first listened to this tribute to the famous Hank Williams Sr., I thought, "Wow, how different this is!". I gotta tell ya, all the artist's on there do a fatastic job! Tom Petty's version of "You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave) to my estimation is about the best cut on the album. Emmylou Harris' version's of "Lost on the River" and "Alone and Forsaken" are just wonderfull and Emmylou's version of "Alone and Forsaken" is about the best version I have heard of that song by another artist. I do have to say that the worst of all takes on the album is Johnny Cash's "I Dreamed About Mama Last Night". Thank goodness it's the last song on the album. Maybe it is because I never liked the song in the first place. I do like Johnny though. The true Hank Sr. fan will love this ablum. Especially if your a music fan
0	Two Great Songs Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs.
0	Better luck next album This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible. Better luck next time. If there is a next time
0	GREAT COMPANION TO THE "AIN'T I'M A DOG" CD I GOT THE ABOVE TITLE FROM ANOTHER VENDER AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEND THIS ONE AND THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST ROCKABILLY ON RECORD/CD. COLUMBIA RECORDS WAS NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IN THE 50'S AND IF THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. GET THIS CD AND THE COMPANION "AIN'T I'M A DOG". YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID
0	he needs to get back with paul brown not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to "seduction" and "sweet thing" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album.
0	8 year-old Daughter hated it My 8 year-old daughter hated the music and wouldn't listen to it. I'd put it in the CD player anyway. She disliked it so much that she took it out of the car and hid it! I was hopeful that this would work
1	it's good, a little too influence heavy I really would just love to LOVE this record, but I just hear too much of the other bands I like that it just doesn't sound as good. Of course this is the usual hardcore fare (no it doesn't have emo parts I'm talking about real HARDCORE not emocore) but it's still good cuase they play it passionatly and you feel it man, you feel it. My favorite line is where he says "I don't need a crew to validate me" man that line alone gave this an extra star. Now hear is a note to those bandana wearing losers who love this album, if you are NOT in a gang DO NOT WEAR A BANDANA! If you are not robbing a bank, don't wear a bandana! If you are not riding a horse or fixing a fence PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT WEAR A BANDANA. It's stupid and you just look like a dork, you'd just hate to see how many people roll their eyes when they see it (but your sooooo cool you just ignore it when those "normal" people look at you). This music is not for emo wusses my friends, the Kid doesn't listen to Dashboard (from the sound of this record I'd say more Ensign and American Nigtmare...) they listen to real hardcore music not whatever the hell loser music you "hardcore" kids like these days. Would you see Atreyu in these guys' cd book? HELL NO! I'd slap you if you even suggested it. So I'm out and please I'd like to beat 8 out of 32 so go ahead and say "no" you freaking dork
1	Is this good? Is this good? If you have ears the answer is Yes.Great tunes ,Great singers.Cooooooooooool
0	WHY PUFFY WHY Bad Boy did a horrible job with this album. There are some good songs (maybe 2-3), but over all this album is wack
0	A dumb joke...and i am not laughing I do not find this CD funny in the least bit. The song "Because I Got High" has got to be the dumbest thing ever written, with one of the most boring beats and repetitive lyrics that I have ever heard. Also, there are other dumb songs like "She won't let me". He tries so hard to be funny to the teenage crowd, and in some ways he succeeds, but to most people, I think that he will just be another annoying comedy rapper that us music listeners dont need to hear
0	Get the singles I saw this in a bin at Wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99. Well, I want my money back. No wonder I only remembered two songs from them Carmel and What would you do. I would say get the singles to Carmel and call it a day. I never liked What Would You Do because it was contradicting...guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice. Wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was. The rest of the CD is slow and boring. Claudette Ortiz has a great voice. She sort of sounds like Beyonce in songs 12 and 14 or vice versa. Save your time, energy, and money on this Cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio.
1	I had no idea I'd love Bruce... I was never a big fan of Bruce Springsteen growing up - I was a "tweener" when "Born in the USA" came out and for some reason his music just never appealed to me. However, this album is so different from his other stuff I've heard (which I completely admit is limited experience) and more like the music I typically like - folksy, bluesy, a bit of bluegrass, just so many things you cannot put it into a box. LOVE IT
1	Ludacris - Chicken N Beer Decent album here by Ludacris. I actually give this album about a 3.75 rating. I liked Ludacris older tracks/albums better. But this one is decent, for southern music that is. I think the production on this album is pretty good, gots some good beats here n there, some tracks are garbage, most are pretty good. Lyric wise, he does good on some tracks, some his lyrics are garbage. Gotta watch out. If your a fan of Ludacris, I dont find a reason why you wouldnt like this album. Half of it is good, half of it aint that good. Check it out before you cop it. But its good for southern tastes. My Top 5 Songs 1.Hard Times 2.Screwed Up 3.Hip Hop Quotables 4.Teamwork 5.We Go
1	The Beatles As I Remember Them "THE BEATLES - THE CAPITOL ALBUMS VOL I" . . . I HAD to get a copy of this box-set collection of the first four American Issued Albums by "The mop Tops". I was a sophomore in high school that year when The Beatles first entered into the consciousness of the world . . . and these four albums re-present exactly the "sounds" we first heard in our experience of the band that changed music forever. "Meet The Beatles" . . . where we first saw the "mop top hair styles" and the half-lit faces we would eventually come to know better than our own face . . . and where we first heard "I Want To Hold Your Hand"! "The Beatles' Second Album" . . . with their cover of "Please Mr. Postman". "Something New" . . . with so many tracks that became synonymous with "The Beatle Movie" -- "A HARD DAY'S NIGHT" . . . "Beatles '65" . . . my absolute favorite Beatles album . . . and the one that was current in my last year of high school . . . with my favorite "No Reply" . . .and that feedback amp noise that introduces "I Feel Fine". For me this collection of American Issued Albums from the Original Master Tapes is nostaligia . . . so many memories associated with these album covers . .and the song sequences . .and even the "echo" quality to the sound reproducton . . . but it is much much more . . . these were great songs and great performances and great recordings! When you listen to them even now, you realize why the Beatles were so special and such a phenomenon . . . and why they probably will never be equaled (although there have been and are and will be many contenders trying to do that). I am glad these albums were issued in their origianl format and sound . . . and I am glad that I lived my youth through the times when all of this was "live" . . . now we only have the recordings . . . but what great recording they are! :) Thank You John, Paul George and Ringo!
1	Amazing I saw this show about a week ago and all I have to say is, this show is amazing. Pure genius. Now, the Witch is one of my dream roles
0	thanks melania I would have saved more time if I had read the reviews first, thanks for the help finding that one song I wanted! verve remix
0	shoot me now i saw these guys live at a ludacris/rufio/walkman/phantom planet concert and i seriously wanted to shoot myself. not only do i hate girl rock bands to begin with, the singer was so annoying. their performance in general was just really really bad, i mean the girl playing the keyboard looked like she just wanted to die. they kept playing more and more songs, more than all the other bands, it was like a nightmare that wouldn't end. her voice is annoying, no range or style whatsoever, the music has nothing going for it. if u're into courtney love and all that crud, u may like this, otherwise bail on this one
1	no title I find it really difficult to write a review about this particular record, actually to write a review about any album by six organs of admittance. that is because this album works in a very non-verbal way. it does not create any clear thoughts in me while i listen to it. instead, it is very meditative and transcendent, it speaks directly to me in a very profound way. i find this record to be very calm and quiet but also incredibly intense at the same time, and it never forces anything. this music has about the same effect on me as buddhist mantras and chants do, but i find it even better. the music itself is consisted of acoustic guitar and drones. there are very few pieces that are lyrical on the record. the compositions themselves are brilliant and they make a brilliant whole. the record works as one piece perfectly for me. i wouldn't compare this music to devendra banhart, vetiver or any other new acoustic outfit, nor would i compare it to any droney "post-rock" bands. comparisons are generally just something silly and irrational, something that doesn't exist, but for the purpose of trying to describe this undescribable and unique music i'd say it sounds like mixture of forementioned buddhist chants, droney music like coil's time machines and brilliant acoustic guitar. six organs's music is unique and true, honest, without any pose, music that is concentrated on substance, not image, and i would recommend it to people who honestly strive to be that way..
0	HE IS JUST LIKE O'REILLY..A PRODUCT HAWKER Most radio shows will just play best of for free( btw Howard Stern invented the " BEST OF SHOW " ) ..to think he is selling it is very Bill O'Rielly. Sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck...vomit , puke
1	THE VERY BEST OF MEATLOAF I've been a fan of Meatloaf since His album "Bat of Hell". I like the dramatic use of orchestral and backgound vocals. I think that Meatloft's voice is so powerful, and these songs prove that. This is by far The best album of Meatloaf's performances. This album along with "Bat Out of Hell", and "Bat Out of Hell II" is all that you need for your collection of Meatloaf. This is a great career retrospective album
1	PERFECT DEBUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT a GREAT as "Stripped" but PERFECT DEBUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a great CD...it doesnt quite show her true potential like "Stripped" but its an excellent debut!!!!!!!!! Britney move WAY outta the way. hahaha CANT WAIT FOR CHRISTINAS "BACK TO BASICS" AUG.15TH!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	What a waste... The songs in this CD was sang by thousand other singers million times. Unless if it's done differently with new arrangements, new style, better performance it's a total waste. My suggestion, please find new songs, there are plenty out there. Give the new writers a chance, pay them few dollars and give them some royalties. And you IL DIVO, will sound more unique and different. After all you have great voices
1	An absolutely beautiful recording The cast in this recording is absolutely phenomenal, and the music of John Bucchino showcases the depth and beauty of his talent. Each song is a heartbreak, starting with Creel's stunning "Unexpressed" to Porter's poignant "Grateful." The performances are stunning, and the lyrics so simple yet so enlightening and a perfect complement to Bucchino's sweeping music. The orchestrations are supposed to be simple with only the piano as accompaniment, but that is all this CD needs. These are cabaret songs, and thank goodness this CD has come to showcase the best of Bucchino's work and this talented cast. It would be a travesty not to have this recording. Every song is a delight, with my favorites being: Unexpressed Sweet Dreams Playbill That Smile Love Quiz A Contact High [Ridiculous, but very clever] It Feels Like Home It's Only Life This Moment Taking the Wheel Gratefu
1	An Impressive, Rockin Debut! Now this is what I call rocking music. I first heard Cheyenne's "One Original Thing" on the movie, Aquamarine, and got hooked on it. I purely bought the CD just for that one song, then found out, there were so many other great ones. "Hanging On" and "Original Thing", title track "Day Has Come", "Everything to Lose", "Mr. Beautiful", "Four Walls" and "Full Circle" are ones worth listening to over and over again. I never get tired of them. 'Hello Goodbye', 'Good go bad' and 'Didn't I' are growing on me-more and more, "Breaking your heart" is edgy along with 'I want to'. This is definitely the type of music to have at a party to dance all night long to, she makes me wanna dance and never stop. This Texan is definitely has a lot of potential
0	Not a very good Christmas album.. except for Clay & Kelly The whole album was really bad. The group did not harmonize well on the ensemble songs. Tamyra screamed her way through Silent Night, a very mediocre version of Silver Bells, performed by Kimberley Locke and Clay Aiken. A boring I'll Be Home For Christmas, by Idol Wannabee, but charming, Justin Guarini had me falling asleep. And Winter Wonderland probably came close to being the worst on the album, but This Christmas, sung by Ruben Studdard beat it. Ruben's charm has disapeared since the show. The vocal performance itself was horrible, but as was the song. What ever happened to Traditional Christmas? I'll have to wait for Clay Aiken's Christmas Album to be released this October. But the highlights are Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - A duet by Tamyra Gray and Ruben Studdard, The Christmas Song sung by Kim Locke, and, the best, The First Noel, sung by Clay Aiken. Think I'm being biased towards Clay? By the album and see for yourself. And of course Kelly was great. She tends to &quot;scream&quot; sometimes, but she did a good job on &quot;Oh Holy Night and My Grown Up Christmas List - there are better versions then her out there, but Kelly is really a great singer
0	"Mom always told me that monsters don't exist... But they do, don't they?" Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced. - Thus says the Pellingto
0	King Holiday info In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus &amp; Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&amp;B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is
0	Nauseatingly syrupy. The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all!
1	Thriller is still "thrilling" ! Best Pop album of our generation..bar none...From the opening snare stabs of Wanna Be Startin' Something on through The Lady In My Life...this collection of songs puts the "magic" in ..you guessed! Magical! Sublime studio musicians, crafty songs and Q's executive duties, and of COURSE MJ's one-of-a-kind vocal/song contributions and least not his incredible mastery of melody and groove..You have not LIVED until you hear this POP masterpiece..Every song shines! Beat It..Human Nature...and Billie Jean..I still listen to this album after 23 years...it's fresh, it's vibrant...and the beats don't stop til you get enough
1	Its like a bad accident, you can't look away.. Face it. This was the best damn music to come out of MJ, audio or video. Jackson hooking up with Quincy Jones was like ten Lennon and McCartneys and and a couple of Bob Marleys all in one mixmaster. I remember when I first heard this album, thinking "He'll never be able to follow this one up". I was right...like a lot of people who thought the same thing. Everything afterwards just didnt have it. Downhill he went...the rest history. THis CD with SACD to kick its [...] is designed to pop your speakercones right out on to the floor. Thriller, right off the shelf all those years ago was top notch in sound to begin with, add a bit of remix and some technology and gawd...Vincent Price's voice at the end of it is sooooo real it creeps you out, like it's suppose to. Put all the headlines and People Magazine articles aside and go back to the early 80's before it all went wrong. Michael was hittin it on all eight cylinders.
0	In my humble opinion - Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede). If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.
1	The Greatest Rock album of all time sex, sin, and repdemtion in 40 minutes I have hestitated to write a review on "Purple Rain" for years because 1. I listened to this album for 4 years everyday (1984- 1988) and never knew what it truly was. 2. In many ways it has made the most profund change in me as a person. 3. Because underneath of it's sexuality is the greatest Christian Rock Album of all times 4. And also the greatest musical statment of the Rock Era. In many ways Prince and the Revolution's "Purple Rain" was the extension of the classic Sly and the Family lineup (whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically) and their second album together he leaves the Minneapolis Sound somewhat and instead of the Punk/Funk Nu Wave vibes of 1999 he opts for Power Pop like The Who and The Kinks on songs like "Let Go Crazy" is a classic clash of synth pop with Townsend -like Guitar chrouses but the lyrics start with him either in prayer in a thearpists chair with a traditonal gospel intro talking about the 'afterworld' or insanity (much like Marvin Gaye lyrically at his best) and with those Minneapolis synths of Coleman and Dr. Fink swirling and vamping about, the song becomes power pop heaven for guitar freaks and the lyrics which captures lust, salvation and insanity with it's perfect guitar solos and the end with it's cathraic release siginals that we are not only listening to a soundtrack but at it's core a Christian Rock Album but it doesn't sound like a Newsboys, Amy Grant or DC Talk album because unlike those groups, Prince talks about the flesh in ways that these artists would never broach on an album. Side one (I have it on vinyl,cd and tape) after the insanity of Let's Go Crazy is the great pop of Take Me with U with it's great arrangement and while Appolonia is vocally limited, she turns in a great performance on this song and Prince being the great singer could have overwhelmed her vocally but he stays in her range "The Beautiful Ones" The only R&B sounding song on side one, is a beautiful declaration of love to his Girlfriend at the time Susanah Melvion. In his best Smokey Robinson/Curtis Mayfield/Eddie Kendricks falsetto he pleads with great tenderness in verse "If I told U Baby If I was in love with U Baby Baby Baby We could Married would that cool In the last verses he demands she makes a chocie Do U want him ? Or Do U want me cause I want U Tell Me Baby Do U WANT ME !!!! I gotta know I gotta Know Computer Blue is probaly the most Song that is Hendrix/Funkadelic in spirit lyrically and in musical exceution with it's Wendy and Lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into the most insane Prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically with the lyric "Til I Find the Righteous One Computer Blue" with The Revolution jamming along Prince plays some of the best solos I have ever him play with it's Eddie Hazel - like first solo before the breakdown into a Ernie Isley-like second (whom I think Prince sounds like )melodic solo til the insane ending with him screaming like a banshee then it fades into the most controvesial song on the whole album , "Darling Nikki" (the reason there are Parental Advisory Tags on every album)is about a visit to a hotel to see a girl who was a 'sex fiend' and a song that while quite tame for today still only gets played late at night because of the lyric mastrubastion. I always thought the guitars had a Led Zeppelin vibe at the time but as I have listened to more Black Alternative Albums it sounds like Funkadelic in it's prime. Side Two (I know I am still doing the vinyl thing) is where you really see the Spritual side come out from the opener 'When Doves Cry' a musical and artistic acheivement with it's lack of bassline the song sounds like a sexual peacan about a woman, but it is actually about hwo one dominates or gives up control in their interpersonal and romantic relationships with really cold and dark lyrics with the lament of "This is what it sounds like When Doves Cry" even when Prince is not singing about sex it bleeds through the lyrics it really is a sad song in many ways but the guitar brillance keeps the song lite. "I would Die 4 U " is a great pop/funk song about faith under the quise of sexuality of God as a woman, a man or something you can't even fathom. Me and my friends couldn't believe at the time Prince was talking about God in all those mainfestions with the chrous "I would die 4 u Baby I'm a Star is actually the most classic Minneapolis Sounding song with those classic keyboard vamps with that chant "Doctor" with Dr. Fink's great keyborad solo and then the finale of "Purple Rain " in which he takes a Marvin Gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them in a godly realm it is lyrically a double endtree you can say he's talk about himself as a woman's savoiur but it can also be about the power of God into one's life. After watching the movie and concert you realize years later that this album at it's heart is a ode to God and sex like many of his classic albums but it is the greatest Christian Rock album of all time because unlike those Christian Rock bands, they are never in touch with the world they are always trying to run away from those issues in their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes unlike Prince who like Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye embraced the scared with the profane and came out with a masterwork for the ages.
0	I'd like to hear it first I ordered this CD on May 19 and I have not yet received it.Please advise as to what to do about this. I know I have been charged and I would like to think this doesn't happen very often. You might know, the first time I order CD's off the net and one of the 3 doesn't arrive
1	Beautiful, lovely CD I saw Jon Randall play live with Emmy-Lou Harris in Nottingham earlier in the year and was amazed by his angelic voice and his lovely songs. This cd is just wonderful and with some highly talented background singers helping him with bone achingly beautiful harmonies, you can't go wrong
0	hahahaha i wouldn't have such a big problem with rap if they didn't call it music. that's like calling the teletubbies 'theater'. a bunch of guys talking to a beat is not music, it's poetry with a rhythm. and these guys don't give a f*ck what they are writing about, all they care about is the loot. so f--- all of these rap artists taking up space on the tv and radio. progressive 4 ever
0	A very deceptive "Greatest" Hits for Whitney Whitney Houston is a nice-looking woman, has a beautiful voice, a good selection of songs... Why her producers have issued this crappy edition of her "Greatest" Hits???... The first disc is OK, almost all of her best romantic hits ("Didn't We Almost Have It All" and "Saving All My Love For You" plus the main theme for "The Bodyguard" originally from Dolly Parton) are included. The second disc however, is purely another attempt to promote these modern (and weird) DJs that "mix" dancing themes, whose original versions are far better than the mixed versions!
1	voices in the room Nice jazz sampler should appeal to most tastes in mainstream jazz since it's not too funky or free-style. What's the real kicker here is the SACD quality. Certainly not what I would call a great test cd but still good for amazing friends with the detailed sonics and tight bass lines and realistic voices in the room effects.
0	Why? This recording is just ok. I didn't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it's not that she is singing the songs just ok it's just that she doesn't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it. make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put "flame' my favorite patti cd
0	Very disapointing!!!! I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!
0	Horrible. Just Plain Horrible. As an Amazon reviewer, I have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that I have listened to that is worth reviewing. More often than not, I will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who haven't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it. However, I believe I have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it. Chingy never was very talented, whether lyrically or flow-wise, but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use, helping make some of the song more listenable. But his follow-up is...well, how can I describe while also being nice...unmitigated crap. There, I used a big word in an attempt to be nice. Even if you're into the whole "cash-money-hoes" pop rap that's been overtaking the mainstream, this album won't do a thing for you. Some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young "hood" life experiences to make it their own, but Chingy, other than his nasaly, thick accent, does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album. All that this album offers is more generic "I'm rich so I'll flaunt it until you puke" crap. Worse, the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the "music". I don't even know if you can call this music, as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down. Chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise. I can't believe I once even listened to this guy. It makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all. He and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives. And for the love of God, Chingy, LEARN TO SPELL! You're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and "Fall'N". I don't see what's so hard about spelling those right. Here's a short lesson: "WHERE ARE THE GET IT GIRLS?" and "FALLING", My god, you can't even spell simple words right. Bottom line: there is no reason why you should buy this album. Like I said, even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms, you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once. You'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full CD price for such a worthless waste of materials. For rap that actually warrants more than one listen, try Busdriver or Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow. For good music in general, listen to great metal bands like Children of Bodom and Blind Guardian, and maybe even some classical composers like Dvorak and Beethoven. Those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than Chingy has in his whole body. This CD gets no points whatsoever. I would also give 0 stars to it, but Amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there's at least a shred of quality on it, but this album doesn't even deserve it. 0/1
1	KISS REVIEW I must give a nod on my site, here, to kiss. since this album is chock-full of the best of kiss, i will thus toss this one into my eclectic mix of a review site, here, of the books, music, and movies i so appreciate - and any song that i recall hearing that literally caused me to turn around and stare at the radio in wonder at what i was hearing definitely gets a top , all time favorite spot on my site. i think i was washing the dishes when i first heard one of kiss' early, trend breaking records , " love gun ". the stucture of the song, the voice, the sound ; loved it. also, i recently heard the kiss classic, "beth", playing quietly over the muzak system at the grocery store. that took me right back to the seventies...and i realized that "beth" -as well as kiss -has quite well stood the test of time.
1	Yes, you DO need the 2-Disc Edition. I received the 1-Disc 'Best of Bowie' for Christmas, back when I was just a Bowie novice. With the 18 or 19 song track list, it was a short listen, but covered all of the basics. The problem was; I wanted more. I searched every record shop, EVERY eBay auction, until I got everything OTHER THAN the Tin Machine albums and 'Black Tie White Noise'. I am WORKING on getting those now. I finally came across the best of bowie 2-Disc edition, and boy am I glad I purchased it! The first extra essential this disc has to offer is the classic 'The Man Who Sold The World'. It was so good, it was covered by Nirvana! I consider it to be one of Bowie's finest; right up there with my all time favorite Bowie song, 'Ziggy Stardust'. It also covers another Bowie essential, 'Life On Mars?'. It's more of a nostalgical piece, the beginning taking place in a girl's dreamworld. He actually performed this with the indie band Arcade Fire. And, of course, it also covers 'Oh! You Pretty Things', which is another classic Bowie song off of 'Hunky Dory'. Other songs that have been put on this album and not on the 1-Disc include 'Sorrow', 'Drive-In Saturday' and the slightly controversial 'John, I'm Only Dancing'. The second disc is more of the 'present' Bowie. The first track is off of 'Low', which many people title 'technologically ahead of its time'. 'Sound And Vision' is one of the most famous songs Bowie has ever done, because it was featured on BBC (I think...) The title track off of 'Scary Monsters' is also here, thank goodness! It is such a good song and it showcases Bowie's 'Chameleon' technique. I'm also satisfied because 'Loving The Alien' is also on this; it's my all-time favorite Bowie song! It also includes more recent Bowie, like 'Little Wonder' and 'Slow Burn'. The 1-Disc Bowie is good for beginners, but if you want a real good taste of the most inventive artist in the world, get the 2-Disc edition. It covers more ground than perhaps any other Greatest Hits compilation (with the exception of Van Halen, maybe...). You wouldn't be dissappointed with this purchase. It's a lot better than getting Bowie's albums as a starter, and then not liking them...although I'm sure you would. It's just that good!
1	This is wonderful! Gene Harris is a true master of his craft. This quartet makes beautiful music; this group is one of which I want all their recordings (and I'm in process of getting it). The mood of the music is very uplifting! The audio signal is clear, as are all Concord Records I've bought. This quartet consists of Gene Harris on piano (and band leader), Ron Eschete on guitar, Jeff Hamilton on drums, and the late GREAT Ray Brown on bass! All ten tracks are beautiful, beautiful
0	Blues and Lamentations Kate sings "Pan Of Biscuts" almost as well as Hedy West cept of corse her guitars no match for Hedy"s great banjo playing. The rest of kates album is even more disapointing. joe
0	A wink is as good as a nod to Rod I'm in the process of confirming the rumour that Rod was being seriously considered for a knighthood until the royal family was accidently subjected to listening to this CD.The rest,as they say,is history. Let's get serious, Every performer of Rod's stature has the right to dress up and sing like a lounge lizard once and awhile. But like every good joke you only have to tell it to the audience once, not three times and counting.The only group that applauded the release of this CD were chronic insomniacs. Rod needs to emerge from the "counting room" of his Graceland mansion in St.Tropeze and get serious about the music instead of the bottom line. Forecasts are not promising. The music industry is abuzz, that his next project under consideration is a tribute album to the legendary Harry Reser and the Clicquot Club Eskimos orchestra. It's being leaked on the web,that through the state of the studio art, Harry's instrumental tracks are being combined with newly created lyrics for many of his best selling tunes. The standouts include,"The Old Town Pump" and"Send Me Back My Honeyman".I have serious reservations concerning the project's success, particularly given the weak performances represented on the American Songbook Vol.3. However,hope springs eternal.
0	Barry Manilow couldn't swing to save the world... Good thing saving the would doesn't depend on weather Barry Manilow can swing. because we'd all be in deep sh*t. Manilow is not capable of swinging, he doesn't have a swingin' bone in his body. He sounds like he can't keep up with the ebergy of the band. Manilow is the last person on earth who should be singing with a big band. Barley Man Enough just doesn't pull this off. Too bad..
0	To much country This was just to much country for this parrothead. I liked one song, Piece of Work and that was about it
0	CLASSINESS AND LONELINESS EV3 came in a time R&amp;B tunes didn't gave to much space for funkyness, the deaprture of Dawn Robinson to a supposed solo career didn't hurt the group in the vocal aspect, perhaps, what went wrong in EV3 wasn't the lack of another girl to make the quartet, in fact was the quality production that the group lack of. &quot;Whatever&quot; the outstanding track of this album, was a slow funky R&amp;B tune that somehow aimed for better airplay that it ultimate received, and of course was the only saveable track. The hole album is influence in that slow R&amp;B beat, not the funky jams of En Vogue that fans were acostume to. Even the highly anticipated ballad produced by no other than David Foster &quot;Too Gone, Too Long&quot; felt in the space of being pure pop, and pretty close too be another flop, but the voices of each En Vogue member shine, specially Maxine's in the bridge part of the song, something that it's caracteristic of EV3 is that was really crowed by filler cuts and really bad ones. In the name of music the only other joint that can be saved from being lost in creativityless, are &quot;Eyes Of A Child&quot; poppy friendly song. Despite the singles releases, and the later mention this album was such a dissapointment for many fans that expected a little more from the &quot;Funky Divas&quot; because after this they should be call &quot;The Amazing Boring Divas&quot;
0	Too Much Ballad, Too Little Honky-Tonk I'm a big George Strait fan and was disappointed by this album. This is not as upbeat as some of his other works, which would not be a problem if the slower pieces matched up well against classics like 'I Can Still Make Cheyenne.' Sadly, they don't. Moreover, even some of the upbeat works on this CD were not up to the high standards that Strait has set for himself. The end result is a CD with a couple of good songs and a lot of chaff. This CD starts off strongly enough, with a piece called 'If The Whole World Was a Honky Tonk;' this is upbeat and well written (Strait did not write any of the pieces on this album). However, the album then starts swinging wildly between some outstanding pieces such as 'Texas,' Strait's cover of Merle Haggard's 'The Seashores of Old Mexico' and the hit 'She Let Herself Go' and some substandard pieces such as 'Oh, What a Perfect Day,' the upbeat but uninspired 'High Tone Woman' and the disappointing title track. By far the worst piece on this CD is 'Good News, Bad News,' a duet between Strait and Lee Ann Womack. This is a long piece that has clearly been designed to show off Womack's vocal range. The song feels like it's missing a verse and like Strait really is just along for the ride. This is a CD that I would only recommend for die-hard Strait fans. There is not enough solid material for the casual fan or for a true twang aficionado to bother purchasing this instead of waiting for the best pieces to show up on a later Greatest Hits compilation
0	A bit disappointed I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys. With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released. Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes." The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it. It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus. Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong. It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had. Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways
1	Easy listening...with style It's a really nice album. You can listen to it for hours without getting tired. The style of Morcheeba is unique and is getting better and more sophisticated with the time. I strongly recommend it as an icon of POP music for this 2003
0	Brandon Flowers, the Hypocrit In short, this cd is half good and half crap. The cd starts strong with catchy guitar, and the obvious sharp synth parts. The thing that gets me is this bands over popularity with a genre of music that has been around for over 25 years. Frontman Brandon Flowers complains about other successful new wave/postgarage bands success (The Bravery, The Fever, Bloc Party, Moving Units) and that they are "riding on our success". Meanwhile the Killers go on tour with Depeche Mode after they reach platinum status and for some reason Flowers doesn't take a hint. He has simply become the Depeche Mode of 2004-whenever this band breaks up (cuz they should). Unfortunately this band has a lot less talent than Depeche Mode, seeing as how Flowers voice is overly futzed with in mastering and he uses a pitch corrector in concert. Plus half their cd sucks and their new cd isn't sounding much better. The new single is awful. Quite terrible. Now I know this review will get a bunch of thumbs down, but I know that those will be from people who have listened to each single on the radio and know nothing about real music, music history, or probably even how to play an instrument, so it won't bother me. If you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands: The Bravery Kaiser Chiefs Moving Units Bloc Party The Fever The Unicorns Wolf Parade The Dove
0	Entirely unclothed emperor parading about embarassingly This is an album the enjoyment of which requires the listener to excuse him- or herself from the very smallest shred of critical intelligence. The gray &quot;oracular&quot; drizzle spreading dully from the 90% asleep gob of this fatuous ennervated biped drives this listener up a tree. I'd excuse him, but I have better things to do, like putting my head in the oven. The degree to which this album is embraced by a loving public strikes me as all the justification a person ought to need to write off the species entirely. Other than that, thumbs up
0	The Best of KC & the Sunshine Band It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original. My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered. Don't order this product
0	not the way to experience 311 i used to be a rather large 311 fan due mainly to the comparisons to sublime. they are pretty good in my book but i must say, this cd is a weak compilation...one has to understand..each of the albums represents a different 311 universe. being reduced to 2-4 songs off of each album mushed together on one gets old very fast. start out with transistor or soundsystem if your into reggae-ish sounds..if your into rap rock..go with grassroots and blue album. this cd is a rip off and a cheapened 311 experience
1	the revolution of hard rock If Ride the lightning was the manifesto then this is the revolution of heavy metal. This is one of the greatest musical pieces every written. Over the first three CD's Metallica recorded they changed the way the world would look at heavy meta
1	Covenant: My hardcore industrial introduction Having listened to FLA, Delerium and Assemblage 23, I checked on the similar artists listing and came across Covenant and was intrigued by this name. I decided to purchase this CD through Amazon.com and was impressed by 'Dreams Of A Cryotank' which stirred pictures in my mind of sci-fic and fantasy ideas. And this music did not disappoint me at all. This is a quite long CD with 12 tracks. Track 11 is the extended song called 'Cryotank' and is a masterpiece of elusive industrial beats and sounds mixed with a slow beginning to a explosive end. Other songs to look out for on this momentous album are the songs; 'Shelter' that reminds me of nuclear disaster movies like 'Testament' and 'The Day After'. Another good song is the high tempo 'Wasteland' that should make it to dance lists if remixed properly fairly shortly. Also check out the bonus song on track 12 'Theremin Club Edit'now that's a dance song! A good CD from Covenant from 1999.
0	I'm sorry but this album sux I listened to this album and I actually felt cancer forming in my ear drums. Nelly is wack as hell period. He is the modern day version of MC HAMMER. Take a look at the music he is making now. This album is commercial as hell but when you slide down Nelly's resume it gets even more commercial. I mean how low can you go? Country grammar has some decent beats that get professionally wasted but the number one beat waster in the world. Nelly is the WORST rapper actor to ever walk this earth. What we need to do to people like this is to yank him off stage and tar and feather this klown. Check out real hip hop like Mos Def and Immortal technique
0	Thought it was better... Before buying the album I only heard 1 song. When I heard the hole track list I was disappointed. They sound like a lot of other things that are out there, so If you like the "same" sound over and over again you might like it.
0	Good songs....but good album? debateable She has some rockin songs on here. All her singles kickass and the last song on the album with M.I.A. (i friggin love her) is fire. but then, i start listening to the other songs, ready for a song on the album that is just as good as her singles and i can't find another. All of missy's singles are crazy, but then ui listen to the album, and its like a let down. any song that she sings in makes my stomach churn and some have just annoying beats and repititious phrases. If you really liked Missy's album 'This Is Not A Test', then get this album. but if you are lovin her singles and want some more, just download the singles, don't waste your money on the rest of this album.
0	big disappointment i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it
1	CD's the SHIZZLE DIZZLE y'all!!! How can you not love a bunch of guys out to make some real quality latin/rock/jam music? Every one of the band members has talent out the wazhoo. The only criticism I can make is that they toned it down too much for the CD. It's real chill, pre-game type music but when you see them live all you wanna do is grab a fine lady and dance till you wear her sexy latin legs out!! Buy the CD, but more importantly, if they're ever playing near you don't even hesitate to buy a ticket (and make sure you have a date!)!!!
1	I Agree - This is Great for homesick Texans Having grown up hearing this album at summer picnics all over the Texas hill country during the 1970's, I had to get this album to take with me when I leave. To me, this captures what live music was like in that area during that time. After having spent many summer nights at places like Floore's Country Store, Gruene Hall and Cibolo Creek, I can certainly feel at home with this album. Imagine a warm night with cool breezes, cold beer and crickets (whose presence is better heard on the CD of this album...). Toss in the smell of cedar and live oak with a dash of a musty walls and you're all set! This album is not to be taken as a top-notch, pristine live recording of a legend playing his hits and the audience roars with wild applause after each. This is as laid-back as the scene was back then. And this is a fun show. I would like to someday hear an expanded version of this show with any more material that might have been performed that night. Then I'd have to get more beer
1	Buy this, please, and listen to real hip-hop. Del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently... the beats of songs merge together as tracks change... El-P makes a cameo... Casual makes a cameo... Prince Paul produces a track... get this album
1	Nice follow-up to Adoration I am a more recent Newsboys fan, so I will not pretend to be able to compare this album with all their previous work. But, Devotion is a nice follow-on to the last album, Adoration. It is not quite as strong in my opinion, but it does have some really good worship songs. Overall, I think the Newsboys are a strong modern worship band, and they have created some great songs on previous albums. As far as this disk does, my favorite song on the whole album is "Orphan" which I think has a really different sound, and I also like "Devotion", "I Love Your Ways", and "Presence". Although some may disagree I really do not like their version of "Blessed be your name". I think it pales in comparison to the original, or the version put out by Tree63. I literally hit the skip button everytime this song comes up. I hate to hear a great song ruined. Having said that, I still recommend this album to any Newsboys fans, or anyone looking for some quality modern worship music.
0	10 years later 2.5 stars Hard to believe it has been ten years since Load came out. Like many Metallica fans I recoiled against it, not because of the songs per say, but the whole image change, the shock of Metallica being on Lollapalloza, the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by Hetfild and Ulrich towrds Metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.It was too much for many people to take, and they rejected Load right then and there. That said, with 10 years passing by, one can listen to Load is a clear eye(or ear). The fact is that while Load is not up to the previous standards of Metallica, it isint all that bad of an album, and despite the dramatica image change, it isint "alternative", either. What Load is more or less is Metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal. Think Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Sad Wings of Destiny era Judas Priest, Deep Purple, Budgie, UFO and Thin Lizzy. It are these influences that are most heard in Load. The mid temp, chunky riffs, the wah-wah pedal drenched solos, simple 4/4 based arrangements. Certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous Metallica albums(even the Black album still had agressive and progressive influences). The problem with why Load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold. One, at 80 minuites, there is quite a bit of filler on it. The hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a 45 minuite frame work at the very most when it came to LPs, Load would have been a double LP, and the number of successful double LPs in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand(the only one I can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is Led Zepplins Physical Graffiti). The filler material really weights the album down. The other problem is the bland, mid range production that Bob Rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power. Some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last 10 years. Songs such as King Nothing, 2X4, Bleeding Me, Aint my [...], Torn Within, the Outlaw Torn and Wasting My Hate are fiarly solid. The problem is the rest of the material is not solid, and still has the lifeless sound. Had Metallica only released one instead of two LOADS, had Metallica had better, more lively production, and had Metallica taken the better tracks off ReLoad such as Fuel, Devils Dance, Unforgiven II and Where the Wild things are, then it very well may have been a near great CD(think 4 stars or A- grade), but alas, Metallica went a different route, and the Loads are still considered a failure overall. I do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire Load CD, but the individual tracks I listed for Ipod make for decent rotation material
1	lifehouse for the fit and healthy lifehouse no name face a superb album that features that single that every remembers as "hanging by a moment" don't be fooled into thinking that the calling were doing something new this is the band whom had the deep voice the superb gritty guitars and belting drums and bass too make you deaf i heard "hsnging by a moment" on vigin radio and my first impressions were sounds a bit like the grunge bands but i loved the song and virgin didn't tell me who it was..so i had to wait about another 6 months until they played it again and i heard them say there name and i thought was "lifehouse" the rock opera pete townsend tried to make but didn't suceeded then i realise this..album is a classic gritty belting heart beating album that struck a chord with me..all the way through and that a strange thing for that to happen... this album features a classic "sick cycle carousel" "somwhere in between" "simon" with amazing lyrics and a sense of purpose of making music from the heart not just formulated for success a classic album and i think it was their only album really
0	You've got to be kidding me! This is by far one of the worse things I've ever heard. Right up there with Chingy or Changy or whatever it is. They should be ashamed. It's a miracle that can say "Laffy Taffy" and still show their faces in public. For shame for shame. For the record, D4L, to para-quote your own lyrics, No "I can't do it it like you" nor would I want to. I would never suck so bad. 1 Star here it comes
0	Tennessee Ernie Ford early hits It does not even sound like Ford and the socalled hits I never heard before and I am old enough to have heard all his hits
0	A "Not Necessary" remake - the Originals are better Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why "remake" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place? I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to "No More Kings" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!
0	Old Dude? Do Ben Clark's teenage fans realize that he's pushing thirty? The dude is OLD. He's not a young jackass, he's an OLD jackass. And isn't it a bit creepy that an OLD dude like Ben tries so hard to appeal to 14-year-olds? Check out the Lashes MySpace profile. Creeeeepy!
0	DISPOSABLE I have good news for the guys in Rooney and Hot Hot Heat: you'll have plenty of free time on your hands these next few months, as Seattle's the Lashes have taken the liberty of recording your new albums for you. Be sure to send them a thank-you card from the beach. I'm only half-joking. Get It, the Lashes' full-length debut, sounds exactly like the aforementioned bands. (Maybe instead of thank-you notes, those bands should be sending cease-and-desist letters.) And while plenty of bands sound like plenty of other bands -- hell, a good chunk of CD reviewing is merely pointing that out -- what's most distressing is that, as a result, the Lashes have no personality of their own. One minor aside: A buddy of mine teased me earlier this summer during a trip to the beach when I popped in Rooney's self-titled debut for a little driving music. "What is this? Inoffensive pop rock mix #1?" he cracked. My friend has a point, and it extends to the Lashes: the music cranked out by these acts is sunny, hooky and instantly disposable pop that works best when used as, well, driving music en route to the beach. Granted, this is not a crime, but it's hard to get too eager about such ephemeral music. Every track on Get It -- with the exception of the mid-tempo, string-section aided "Dear Hollywood" -- is upbeat and interchangeable-with-every-other-track-on-the-disc power pop, from the jangly single "Sometimes the Sun", the New Wavy flourishes of "The World Needs More Love Letters", and the bouncy keyboards of "Nate's Song". Trying to differentiate between these songs is like trying to pinpoint the differences between brands of toothbrushes -- they all do about the same thing, with very little variation. I mentioned that there are no actual crimes against music on Get It, but the Lashes are guilty of playing it too safe.
0	Sucks! The music sounds like generic oldschool Eurobeats which is fine. But the vocals are terrible. He sounds like the biggest fag in the world. They're even worse than Eiffel 65
0	Among the most forgettable of Part's oeuvre This ECM disc contains four works from the late 1980s and early 1990s by Estonian composer Arvo Part, performed by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra conducted by Tonu Kaljuste. Starting in the mid-1970s and continuing through the era of these recordings, Part composed in a style he called "tintinnabuli" for its bell-like tones. The austereness of the music and the religious titles of many of his works have earned this genre the name "holy minimalism." These four pieces I found these to be the most forgettable of Part's works. "Te Deum" (1984-1986), dedicated to the music publisher Alfred Schlee, is the oldest piece here. At almost 29 minutes, it is also the longest. A setting of the well-known Latin hymn, "Te Deum" combines choral moments with some striking passages for strings. While I don't care to return to it often, the piece is for me the high point of this otherwise dismal collection. "Silouans Song" (1991) is an instrumental work inspired by the poem of St Silouan the Athonite which begins "My soul yearns after the Lord and I seek him in tears." It is unmemorable music, sounding like a film score, and covers no interesting ground in its five minutes. "Magnificat" (1989), a ghostly a capella setting of Mary's words after her visitation by the Archangel Gabriel, is similarly disappointing. "Berliner Messe" (1990-1992) simply baffles me. With a theme like the Mass, one should produce something grand and moving; simply look at what Mozart did with his several Masses or, among contemporary works, Ligeti in his Requiem. Instead, Part gives a dull, lifeless, and barely-audible work that has few redeeming qualities. The "Berliner Messe" was revised in 1996, and that version can be found on the recent Naxos disc. The booklet contains the text of each of the choral works, along with translations into German, English, and French. It also has many photos of the beautiful Lohja church in Finland where the pieces were recorded. However, like the rest of the Part releases on ECM, there is no biography of the composer or musical analysis, a phenomenon I am beginning to get fed up with. I have generally been hard on Part's work during this period for lacking any real orthodox sincerity, though his PASSIO of 1982 stands as an important exception. Part really hit his stride during the mid-1990s, when he began to broaden his style and use elements from his Eastern Orthodox faith, a time when he produced his magisterial setting of the "Kanon Pokajanen" pentinence text of St Andrew of Crete. His tintinnabuli works could at best be called merely entertaining instead of truly insightful. However, the pieces represented here are not even that. If you have never heard the work of Arvo Part before, I'd recommend getting the LITANY or KANON POKAJANEN discs or, if you want to hear music from his tintinnabuli phase, the TABULA RASA disc, all of which are also on ECM. This TE DEUM disc is best left to completists
1	One of their best Definitely their most commercial album and in that sense to most people probably their best. Nothing will ever touch Master of Puppets in my opinion, but from beginnning to end this a top notch album without a single weak track. If you're a diehard metal fan and never listen to anything else, you might want to avoid this one and stick with the pre-black albums. However, if you love a solid hard rock/metal album this is one of the handful that is a must own
0	More Like BAD Let me just say, I'm not a Seattle scenester, I'm not illiterate and I don't like the Lashes. Sorry! I found a copy of this EP in the used bin at my local record store so I thought I'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks. Needless to say it's going back to the used bin. Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now. What's the point? These songs are derivative with a capital "D". The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there. The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB! It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary. Even my friend said "It sounds like these guys are about one year too late." The Lashes are so derivative and unoriginal I almost suspect they were "manufactured" to be popular. Absolutely soulless.
0	WTF?!?!?!?!? Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days. Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45
1	Why emo was good once I've had this album forever and it, to me, is an expression of emo when it was: (a) as a term, a much more precise description; and (b) as a body of work, good because it coupled actual musicianship and intelligent lyrical talent to garner such a true expression of raw emotion that to listen was to live that emotion, in a phenomenological sense. To this day, &quot;the new hangout condition&quot; (from which comes the cd's title) and &quot;today or tomorrow&quot; are favorites of mine. While my predecessor reviewers are right that this album (and, truly, karate) will never be &quot;amazing&quot;, they can best be described as &quot;honest and true&quot;, which is also valuable
1	Corina!! this band has a cute singer, Corina with chipmunk cheeks. She sounds like Belinda Carlile. I just want to pinch her cheeks!
0	New, but Bland Don't get me wrong - it is wonderful to have A CHORUS LINE back on Broadway. It is also wonderful to have this new recording, which is essentially the entire score. It be nice if "And..." could have made the cut, but the money hungry producers shouldn't be expected to include that. (Yes, that was sarcasm). The current revival is a wonderful evening in the theatre - but what makes it so wonderful is only PART of what made it so wonderful the first time around. Michael Bennett's choreography and direction are brilliant, and they alone are worth the price of admission. When the show fails, it fails because of the cast. Unfortunately, most of the flaws have been captured on this recording. Some of the orchestrations are bland and sound "canned" (just as it does in the theatre.) The opening number plays at a DEATHLY pace. Charlotte D'Amboise can't sing. It just doesn't work. Get it if you're a collector, but if you're not - save your money. Get the Original
0	Once again THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! I just reviewed the other cd and like i said its a waste of your money. Save your money for something valueable
1	Wonderful album needs remastering!! "The Best of george Harrison" is a wonderful compilation of his best Beatles and post-Beatles hits and songs, but I find myself agreeing with other reviewers on the choice of Beatle songs. "If I Needed Someone" and "Think For Yourself" could have been replaced with "All Things Must Pass" and "Isn't It A Pity" which deserves to be here even more since the "My Sweet Lord" 45 was a double sided hit with that track. This would have also tipped the scale more toward George's solo sides, to make a more even handed comp. Also, this CD has been out forever, it not only needs to be recompiled, but REMASTERED!! It pales beside the remasters of the original albums. But if you cannot buy the individual albums, "The Best Of George Harrison" is a decent pick for someone wanting to check out his music for the first time
0	what a waste This CD will no doubt appeal to drunken frat boys and fellow travelers, but to me it's all a waste of what once was a genuinely interesting (though far too self-indulgent) singer. In the old days I could forgive the relentless self-pity about how awful it was to be his father's son, because the occasional great performance came through. But there's no such saving grace here - and the explicit lyrics are just pathetic; we've all heard more accomplished filth from grade schoolers. No wonder Amazon - and most other retailers - are discounting this CD so heavily
0	Scraping the bottom of the barrel As if Toxicity wasnt mediocre enough, this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it. Where do we place the blame? Is it Darons poor songwriting skills? Or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible MTV-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up? Or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and TV? Whichever one you choose, this is not the SOAD we all love, this is an unoriginal rehash of Toxicity. Oh wow, they have an anti-government song? So what, who hasnt made one of those. And anti-war songs? Travel back to the 60s, they were chock full full of them. Everything I hear is uninspired and downright lazy. Its also unfortunate that Serj got sidelined by Daron "I wish I had talent" Malakian, for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs, while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have ADHD in your classroom that are just seriously not funny. Maybe im being to harsh, but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-Toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure, and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics. You want to get good music, get SOAD's self titled, its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as MTV.
1	we need more rough cutt It's bands like these that make the 80's shine.Too bad they did'nt make more releases.What's really sad is that a lot of rock stations don't even play this.paul's voice is very distinctive,also got his solo stuff.So if you get the oppurtunity buy this and any of paul's cd's.This is elite compared to the likes of kickaxe and black n blue.All in commin with great hard rock and songs that have hooks all over.And to mention they all did'nt make it big,what a shame!
0	Metallica - 'Reload' (Elektra) 2 1/2 stars Review no.618.Somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'Load' CD, which was one of their better works ever,I thought. I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible,it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here,I thought were okay,are "The Memory Remains" (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original),"The Unforgiven II",the melodic "Where The Wild Things Are" and "Bad Seed". Not the worst metal release I've ever heard,by any means. Take my advise,buy a used copy of this title
1	it's growing the more you listen to this cd the better it gets. it will sink in,just give it time
1	More than a Decent Album I keep reading reviews of Rainbow albums as decent or average, which is an understatement. While Rainbow never reached the musical heights of Deep Purple, the band was, in it's own right, influential in creating the gothic hard rock sound that so many derivative 80's English metal bands embraced. I admit that I AM biased in Blackmore's favor, but that's because he is THAT good of a guitarist and quite underrated. Listen to each song, but don't waste your time on "If You Don't Love Rock and Roll," which elicits about as much emotion as watching lichens growing on rocks. However, "Man on the Silver Mountain" and "Self Portrait" are 70's metal classics
1	macabre jazz at its finest Its difficult to determine where to begin when describing "Submariner". This is one of the most richly layered albums I have ever heard, not only that, but there are only three members to The Dead Science. To start off, the brothers Bischoff and vocalists Mickens started off as a arty jazz ensemble hitting the clubs in the Seattle area. Its clear that that jazz background permeates the album but putting your finger on who to compare THIS style of jazz to is very challenging. When one thinks modern day jazz influenced musical acts with dark overtones, a wide variety of artists that may range from Portishead to Nostalgia 77, maybe even Soul Coughing may come to mind. Whats amazing is that each one of these bands/artists have left traces of their jazz lineage DNA, and yet they sound nothing alike. The same is the case of The Dead Science's Submariner. This Album stands apart though by being surprisingly organic. No scratches, no samples (not to say there's anything wrong with those, but) this is an album that relies on its craftsmanship. Let's take track # 7 for example. The song is called Threnody, which literally means song of lament, sometimes used in funerals. This threnody called Threnody would be the best ambassador to Submariner as there is a collective of seemingly sporatic jazz improve. Upon closer listening though, one would be able to glean that this is as simultaneously horrifying and beautiful as a Giger metamorphasis. There is no conflict of musical elements as a double bass vamping is followed by flat rapid precussion artistry, which is needle-and-threaded with lyrics like "Corpses buried on the banks of the Mississippi river" and "Cell wall divisions corroding under falsities". "Below", "White Cane", and "The Ghost Integrity" are also very strong points to this album, although every song works well together as a well oiled submarsable.
0	letdown the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment. this one is just all cheese. the guitars have been replaced with 80's (the bad 80's) sounding synthesizers and the hooks, which may still be there, are just buried under layer after layer of production. i can't even believe this is the same band. i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was. the reception was..uh..not good
0	Boring and repetitive This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer. His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South. He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's
0	Band was so bad, singer killed himself This band's stated agenda was to create good old pop music, the kind you used to hear on the radio in the 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately, their execution was lacking. Their singer and songwriter had next to no talent. His best work was singing with Liz Phair on a cover of "Turning Japanese." And even that was hollow and soulless. Then he killed himself and nobody cared except maybe close personal friends and relatives, but maybe not even them if they'd heard this record. It's that bad
0	impulsive? i bought this record i don't know why. i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok. i listened to it once and it sounded so blase. i don't really know what i expected. i have add so sometimes lyrics don't really matter-- the rocking of the music does, which may be why i like jazz so much, because it doesn't have words. neither here nor there. any way: and yes i know this isn't really much of a review: i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside. i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is. first listenl-- not impressed. but give it a chance.
0	"Tallahassee Pain....in the @$$" Let me just say that, while I don't own the album, I did buy it for my wife. She loves it. That doesn't say too much for her taste in music, though. She also loves Akon... I was born and raised in Tallahassee. I listened to an interview that this overly-cocky s.o.b. gave, where he called all the artists in t-town crabs in a bucket, and that he had to struggle and fight to make it out. That he was the first artist to ever make it big out of the Capital City. There are a couple of issues with that. Like mainly the fact that he wasn't first, or even in the top 5. You may have to go back a little ways, but all you really need to do is check out a Dead Prez song called (of all things) "Tallahassee Dayz". stic.man himself went to Rickards High School on Tally-ho's South Side. So, he (T-pain) needs to get his history straightend up first before he decides to go on national radio and embarrass himself (again, and again, and every time they play his damn songs). Oh, three more things: 1) That video he claimed he shot in Tally was shot in ATL, 2) I wouldn't have given this any stars if I could've avoided it, and 3) I don't know WHAT he's talking about, but there ain't no strip clubs where I'm from..
0	bad singing the beats are hot as fu*k but the singing is just terrible. the beats are crazy on this disc but t-pain cant sing for his life at all. you can tell his voice is all metallic on his songs. but two stars for the beats. the lyrics aren't very good either
0	50 cent and ja rule need to be deported from the planet Why do you all still support this clown? Ja rule hasn't been hot since his first album. Then he let a clown just as wack as him crush his career. Ja rule is as commercial as they come and his lyrics display that. He is all about the money and not about making good music. This is a very poor release. It is just as wack as dem franchise boys and d4L. Jefferey needs to stop rapping and go rob a bank like steady b
0	Another must situation for zero stars As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too
0	Baduizm nothing to write home about. Lot of rap style rifts but nothing that challenged her vocally.
0	Is this really Brian Stokes Mitchell singing? I eagerly awaited this album, ever since hearing Mr. Mitchell sing in the Kiss Me Kate CD. His singing in Kiss Me Kate is unbelievably gorgeous, with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word. The singer on this CD is hardly recognizable as the same singer. The timbre of the voice is not the same, Mr. Mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer, not the magnificent Broadway star he is. I hope he does another album, the next time bringing to life great Broadway songs in the style of his Kiss Me Kate and Man Of La Mancha performances.
0	a dissapointment Don't get me wrong, I love Brian Stokes Mitchell. His deep voice is intoxicating and beautiful, which was why this CD was such a dissapointment. All his songs are high and do not show off his wonderful low voice. Mitchell should stick to what he does best and it is not covers of songs made for tenors. I hope his next album will be more fit for his voice, I'll be the first in line
1	He does it again! Two Lights by Five for Fighting is probably his best work so far. I highly recommend buying this CD
0	Bizzy Fell Off Biggg Time!!!! Man, what to say about this album. First off Bone Thugs are overrated, they're good but not great. Creepin on ah come up, e-1999, and art of war being their best material. Resurrection, and thug world order are nothing special. Maybe the biggest issue they have is finding at least "decent" beats. Creepin, and e-1999 had that rough rugged gangsta sound. Their later efforts have imo really wack, and soft somewhat commercialized beats that they never seem to fit with properly. Bone brothers is another example of this. Art of war also had some decent beats but way too much soft stuff that doesn't properly portray their image. As a whole Bone thugs have that special recipe, as solo artists they just don't cut it. Krayzie's solo albums have A FEW good songs, the rest being filler junk! Layzie, does not belong as a solo artist. Bizzy can't pull it off either. As a group they can write blazing lyrics because there is four of them so their verses aren't all that long and come out golden. But doing a whole song, OR ALBUM by themselves they sound half @$$ed! On art of war Bizzy had developed his hyperspeed flow. Now he has given up that flow for his new funky supa WACK sometimes slow, sometimes kinda quick, but losta garbage singing flow. BIZZY STOP SINGING, u sound like trash!!!!! This album suffers from Bizzy's wack flow, and super generic wack beats. It's funny how people say Bone is better than Twista. Yeah I'll admit it, not since his Tung Twista days was Twista able to outflow Bizzy (art of war verses), but u know what when it comes to a more CONSISTENT flow, and understandability Twista wins hands down. Bone (especially Bizzy) changes their flow up too much in a SINGLE song and sing too d@mn much! And this album (plus all the other bone solo releases) shows why it takes a GROUP effort to outshine one man (twista) on an album. As solo artists NO bone member can hold down an entire album by themselves, Twista can!! Where is bone now??? Twista is at the top of the game, and bone fell off long ago
0	Come Fly With Me Clarity of CD and DVD not good compared to "Caught In The Act
1	CATCHY pop punk the huntingtons are the best band around today... and this is their best release! they bring a certain element of songwriting that no other band can duplicate.. they are funny lyrics but they also mean something unlike many other bands. The guitars stick in your head all day and it doesnt even bother you! There should be 20 stars for High School Roc
0	Get over yourself, fat boy Just who wants to hear Van Morrison complain like an old ninny about the press, or the pitfalls of being a godlike, mythical celebrity trapped by his own legend and fame--and all of it contained in bland rocking-chair Muzak jazz. Three chords and some bad lyrics and right away they come on with a messiah complex. (You fans and your empty lives are partly to blame for all this.) "I just want to sing my songs," he whines. (Who's stopping you?) John Waters once said: if you want to be left alone, pick up a monkey wrench and fix toilets and stay out of show business. Besides, I didn't know Van the Man was all that famous. Does anyone under 50 know who he is? I sure haven't seen any articles in the paper about him lately. Old hippies might still babble about "Into The Mystic" and his performance in "The Last Waltz." I heard him sing "Gloria" on an oldies station the other day and I went straight for Rush Limbaugh. Are the royals in England so desexed these days that the Daily Sun has to write up Van Morrison to this degree of musical paranoia?
0	Going through the motions This isn't as bad as the garbage tracks Morrison did to get out of his Bang recording contract (nothing like &quot;Ringworm&quot; in this collection), but this is not even a mediocre Van release. I like most of his releases, even COMMON ONE, INARTICULATE SPEECH, and BEAUTIFUL VISION. Here, Van just seems commited to getting the &quot;product&quot; out on time. DOWN THE ROAD was much stronger, and DAYS LIKE THIS
1	New dimension for underrated singer-songwriter Joseph Arthur has been quietly gaining a deservedly fine reputation for his emotionally raw, yet very well crafted songs. Breaking away from the RealWorld label, where he released the excellent 'Come to Where I'm From' and 'Redemption's Son' amongst others, he has added a richer more polished layer to his honest lyrics and affecting music. None of the tracks reached me as immediately as favourites, such as 'In the Sun', 'September Baby' or the beautiful 'Honey and the Moon' but soon enough a few gems appear. 'Echo Park' and 'A Smile that Explodes' are standout tracks in an album that rewards the listener throughout. His vocals focus on the higher register more than past outings, which is refreshing, but this is as characteristic and interesting as ever. Some tracks may be more geared towards an American audience, such as 'Leave Us Alone' but there is plenty to keep the British listener entertained, too. Appearing on lauded soundtracks such as the OC and Shrek 2, and supporting REM, his unique style and gravely voice have already won him quite a few fans but this new album should see that growth continue. Recommended.
0	HORRIBLE GARBAGE! i can't believe that they got a major label deal based on this album. if you want some GOOD mcr check out three cheers for sweet revenge. that's a good album. don't get me wrong. i love this band. but this is just crap. there are no melodys...it sounds like it was recorded in one of the band member's bathrooms..and it's just heavy guitars and screaming about vampires and other hogwosh. skip this detour. i can't believe i bought this album hoping it would grow on me. it hasn't
1	Best of the best The Beastie Boys are the best out there. And this is their best album. 20 songs that are all unique. Best Song: Pass The Mic Other great songs: Gratitude Finger Lickin Good So Watcha Want Stand Together Pow The Maestro Professor Booty In 3'
0	At Last was disappointment Turns out I purchased this cd for one song. I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd. The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd
0	Poorly done album Did not like this album at all. Poorly written and musically a failure. No wonder this guy trashes other artists
0	Allison Moorer Getting Somewhere I was so disappointed when I heard this CD. The background music overpowers Allisons voice. If I had heard this before I bought it, I would have passed on it. I can't say anything good about it. Thanks OV
1	Best album ever This is the best album ever. Rainbow gets heavier and faster on this album and just improve overall. Dio's vocals are out of this world and Blackmore's guitar playing is incredible. Every song on the album is a masterpeice. Tarot Woman is a fast power metal fantasy song, Run With The Wolf is a slower fantasy song, Starstruck is a fast neo classical song, Do You Close Your Eyes is a radio friendly rock song with a catchy riff and catchy chorus, Stargazer is an epic, power metal, neo classical metal masterpeice and the best song I've ever heard, A Light In Tbe Black is another epic power metal song which continues the Stargazer story execpt much faster this time, there are 2 long solos one is a keyboard solo and one is a guitar solo. Stargazer is the best song I've ever heard and the rest are classics aswell. Every musician on this album contributes there best performances ever on this album. This is by far the best album I've ever heard. Fans of Rainbow, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Elf, Dio, Stratovarius, yngwie Malmsteen, Hammerfall and metal and rock in general will love this as you can see from the other reviews
0	No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.
0	I agree - don't buy it So I'm not the only one who feels ripped off! I was so angry when I played this (on an excellent system and at a decent volume) and discovered that many of the tracks are (poor) live recordings. Like so many artists, he has passed his prime and his concert performances are but a pale imitation of the original recordings; and it is those original recordings his fans remember and expect. I was so angry I was tempted to write to Neil and complain. Unlike one of your unhappy reviewers, I did not even have the benefit of a sticker warning of the live tracks. If you're a real fan of the man, don't buy it.
1	mix of moods and movement Purchase this CD - don't hesitate. This album with make you tap your feet and clap your hands. It's up, down, spin around. Their own unique sound splashed with hints of other artist influences. Instant gratification once you hit play! A blender of the Rentals, Concretes, Velvet Underground, Cure, Psychadelic Furs, Snow Patrol, Mercury Rev, Belle & Sebastian, Ride, Wedding Present, and Spiritualized
1	Good Music however the Title is Technically False. There is some good music on the two discs. The first one collects most of Paul and Wings hit singles whilst the second are some personal selections from Paul, where some gems can be found such as "Too Many People", "Tomorrow", "Daytime Nightime Suffering" and "Maybe I'm Amazed". Some of the material on the second disc is a little slight and there are many better songs that could have been selected. The main issue is that these songs are not all technically Paul McCartney and Wings, alot of them are Paul and Linda, Paul on his own, is its not a true representation of strictly Wings, currently Wings Greatest is just that. Having said that You can't go wrong with the great catchy pop rock on this album. It is good to see Wings get more coverage, beneath the Beatles they really are getting some respect for the great band they were
0	Cheesy, corny Gothic-wanna be Midnight Syndicate wants to be a lot, I guess. It wants to be dark and scary, but they're more like a graphic vampie novel, you can admire the technique but you don't really get involved. The images they produce remain a bit plastic, static, with an overdose of well-known themes. Twenty one short tracks, too short really, are offered here, with a not-all-to-believable-and-scary voice talking: "Born of the night, they lurk in the shadows...Gargoyles of living stone, lost souls who wander mist shrouded cemetaries, and vampires who dwell deep within forbidden crypts... Creatures of the night, they arise as darkness descends..." Can lines about things that hide in the dark be even more cheesy? Then some strings are touched like guiter wires and this sounds rather good. A heavy churchbell starts humming, dark but single layered ambient creeps in. But it's all still too obvious, and more and more I get the feeling this is some sort of "starters kit for Gothic fans". You want effective, deeply seeded dark ambient that really knocks the light out of you, try "Within the depths of silence & phormations" by Raison d'Etre or any of Lustmord's solo albums "Heresy" or "The place where the black stars hang". But of course, giants in the dark ambient world like Lustmord or Raison d'Etre don't really mess with vampires and Gargoyles and bombastic electronic sounding choirpulp. And because of this, there will still be an audience for an act like Midnight Syndicate. I just hope that M.S. will evolve more, make less tracks, and the ones they do make, should be stretched out more, giving them a chance to get more layered and filled with more depth than they are now. Track three, the title track, offers a truely menacing piano tune, but because the composers don't seem to know what to do with it, they just keep on repeating it. And after a short three minutes the track is over. And "corny humming number four" starts. So what?
0	Is My Stereo Broken? First of all, let me qualify this review by stating up front that I have been a DM fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians. That being said, I think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band: a real lack of vision and originality. On the good side, many DM diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms. On the bad side, it's all too familiar stuff with beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts. The only real difference is that the tracks on "Angel" sound like they've been fed through a fuzz-box. The first time I listened to this disc, I thought I had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy. I soon realized this was intentional, but had to ask myself, why? "Exciter" was experimental, but a truly drained effort. This album sounds like a pale imitation of Bjork. They even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on Bjork's "Vespertine" album. The difference between Bjork and DM is that Bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood. This album just sounds like conventional mid 80's DM music that was fed through badly recorded effects. I really could feel the creative slide with this band when "Ultra" was released, but this record confirms what I have sensed for some time. The band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of Alan Wilder. Martin Gore is a musical genius, but he has limitations when carrying 90% of the musical vision and writing. I really think Gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas. Unfortunately, this album sounds more like a Gore solo effort than a true DM product and as a result, the music has greatly suffered. Gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant, edgy lyrics. Here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics (yawn). A new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or I fear this may be their last record. Word of advise: although this album does show some promise at times, your best friend here is iTunes. Download "Precious" and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices. You may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your iPod
1	The Rock Gods Smile If you play this CD in reverse it says "Jesus is Satan." Comets on Fire are dense. Blue Cathedral was a punishing wall of noise. Listening to it I felt like one of those explorers in the black and white Tarzan movies equipped with a machete inching through the foliage. However, once you carved out your own path the album rewarded you tenfold. Comets are unapologetically classic rock, but instead of just breaking out the old Hendrix and painting by numbers they added some proto-punk and an echoplex. Some thought Blue Cathedral was more attitude than it was songwriting, and to them Avatar is the perfect rebuttal. Here the Faces riffs and Robert Plant vocals are slowed down to further reveal the songs to the point where someone who hated Blue Cathedral might actually like Avatar. Don't worry, there's still use of the echoplex, and the songs are drawn from six to eight minutes in length (with one exception), but Comets have traded in some of their feral energy for a more dynamic sound. Benefiting the most from the new dynamics is the bad acid sounding "Lucifer's Memory," a song that sounds like a flower wilting. There's a certain cadence that plugs along with the chugging vocals pushing the song towards its seven minute mark. It has quickly become my favorite new song of this year. While there are still some rockers, such as the opener "Dogwood Rust" which sounds as if its beginning should be found somewhere before you pressed play, just as the closer sounds as if it ends before the song has stopped, even these rockers sound less brutal than their predecessors. Only "Holy Teeth" has the same long-haired head banging attitude as Blue Cathedral, and it only lasts three minutes (only a minute in Comets on Fire time). At almost nine-minutes "Soup Smoke" pushes the limits of pseudo-tribal beats. Instead of punishing noise Comets are pounding repetition into our heads. Just thirteen more seconds and I think I would have had a spiritual vision. At only six minutes long the closer "Hatched Upon the Age" proves that it takes more than just length to be epic and more than just noise for a crescendo. The miracle of the album is that through all of the interplay between the instruments sometimes it's just a couple of simple repetitive piano keys to bring it all home. Avatar is easily one of the best releases of '06. Very few bands can bring me back to that feeling I got discovering classic rock bands in middle school. But don't break out your eight tracks and dust off the old bong yet. Unlike most bands, retro is only half of the story for Comets on Fire. Comets on Fire are ultimately timeless. Try as I might, I cannot lump them with all the other seventies rockers, but their sound hardly seems contemporary. It's as if they've found some time wormhole so they can rock on across the ages. I'm there, man, I'm there
0	Not his best Tim has had better albums. Personally I'm not crazy about thuis one. It's my least favorite
1	Very entertaining I didn't think that I was a Beck fan, but I happened to hear this when a friend was playing it in his car and was instantly drawn into it. I have been playing it frequently ever since. It is the first CD I have ever owned that has anything akin to rap or hip hop and I just really like how he blends it into so many other styles to create a complete feeling of a musical environment. I will be delving into some of his other CDs in the future
0	Another band that sounds the same as all the others (sucks) well the band sounds like a yellow card,simple plan,panic at the disco,all american rejects etc. ALL of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy. And you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio. If your older 18 and up. you need to get in to some GOOD music. Try the ramones, the offspring, sex pistols or even green day.
0	The 5-star reviews are complete bull Does this band even know how bad they sound? This is the same generic emo c r a p as AFI, Green Day, and My Chemical Romance. They think they're SOOO clever with the song titles. Yeah, right. Song titles don't need to be 1,500,000 words long. By the time they get the titles out in the refrain, the song's over. as I have said, don't waste your time or money. Chrissy: Call me out if you must, but I really don't give a rat's a.s.s. what you think of me. To try and derail all the people with common sense is pathetic and childish. PS: "Clueless whiner!" Re: Interesting comment, considering you spent nearly all of your "review" bitching about other people. Who's the whiner now
0	The downfall of Fall Out Boy... This might be a "great" cd to some people, and it might be good in your eyes, but it is blasphemy to GOOD MUSIC. Why don't you guys try bands like Black Flag, The Sex Pistols, The Misfits, maybe even my personal favorite 90's grunge, i.e. Nirvana. Fall Out is so whiny, I'd like to give a thumbs down, for the future of good music don't buy this cd
0	oh, wow, another band with just 2 members ... Somebody call Queens of the Stone Age and tell them that Death From Above stole their equipment ... and their licks. Is there room for another QOTSA? Probably. What I'm wondering is why this isn't found all over cheeseball commercial radio stations. But then, this isn't quite the adolescent, swoon-inducing caterwaul of, say, sickly sweet dollboys Fall Out Boy or the faux-heavy attention-spanless swill of mascara-dowsed cherubs Hawthorne Heights. Death From Above, while not at all mind-expanding, truly is heavy and heavy is not light, and light is bright and bright light breeds happy thoughts and happy thoughts are a preteen girl's wet dream. So, while it's a perfect match for formaldehyde-smoking jocks and tuba-sized bong-owning dropouts, it doesn't quite fly with the doll-collecting crowd. And who knows, I haven't seen what the band members look like; maybe they all have buckteeth, receding hairlines and crossed eyes and that's why they didn't get a TRL invite.
1	I Enjoy It More Than My Son I purchased this CD for the daily car trips around town when my son is with me. Most every track has characters talking, giving intros to the letters and such. All very cute, very Seasame Street - and 100% a stroll down memory lane. I'm not sure if it's all in mono, but most of the songs are from way way back - probably 70's and 80's. I get a kick out of it because it's nostalgic; and my son enjoys it because he gets to sing along and learn the alphabet
1	Genius at work: Caution to those without taste There is no type of music in the entire world that can prepare you to experience Aesop Rock's "Float". And that's the way it should be. Float is the most unique, in-depth, and complete look into the mind and thoughts of a master of his trade that I have listened to. Blockhead, and Aesop himself, create some of the darkest, most incredibly tangible beats that I have ever heard in my life and I just can't get enough of it. If you finally manage to digest and appreciate the cryptic beats then worry not, the lyrics will keep you busy for years to come. The sheer volume of words is tough to decipher as presented, but combined with his winding analogies and metaphors, it is nearly impossible to understand it all. That is more of a compliment than it seems as I could honestly listen to this entire CD without attempting to understand a single word, just simply being engrossed by the perfect harmony between his vocal inflections and his beats is enough for me. To be able to visually read Aesop's lyrics while listening to him takes him to a level no one will ever approach again. If someone like Sage Francis (the closest to Aesop as I've seen) tickles your fancy then give Aesop a try, I promise he won't disappoint
1	DA BOMB! Intro-this intro practically screams The Godfather but it alwayz makes me laugh! So Good-I always really loved this song. It really talks about the people that never really beieved them. I always thought of this song as a single. 9/10 Bills, Bills, Bills- Another great single from Destiny's Child. The music video is really good and funny! 8/10 Confessions- In my option, Im not really into this song. I mean i like the lyrics but i'm not into the beat. i sometimes skip this. 6/10 Bug a Boo-Great Single! When it first came i really loved this song and i still do!! In the music video I don't get it when the go to the marching band or whatever.. 8/10 Temptation-A sweet sexy song. It's really good for a slow song about being tempted. 8.5/10 Now That She's Gone-Same option like Confessions. Love the lyrics don't know about beat though. I don't skip it as much though 7.5/10 Where'd You Go?-Really love this beat and lyrics!! Sweet song about finding her man. 8/10 Hey Ladies- I love this song!! Great single for us women. I kinda wanted this to be a single. I can imagine the music video.. 9/10 If You Leave-I love the duet between Destiny's Child and Next! it's really loving and sweet 9/10 Jumpin Jumpin- LOVIN THIS SONG!!! Hot club song!!!! It's pratically impossible to not dance!! 10/10! Say My Name- I LOVE THIS SONG EVEN MORE!! great beat and lyrics! I havev't met anyone who hasn't heard this! 10/10! She Can't Love You-Loved this song as well! it's a beautiful and talks about a girl telling her ex that he girlfriend was love wasn't as godd as hers. 9.7/10 Stay-this song is great as well!! Great vocal cuz you can actually hear everyone's voices. I don't why but I can imagine Mariah Carey singing something like this 9.5/10 Sweet Sixteen- I'll tell you the truth i'm not really into this song. The lyrics and melody I don't why I'm not into it...maybe because I'm not 16! :) 7/10 Outro Amazing Grace-I love these vocals!!! It show that they can sing great even withoust any beats!! 9.8/10
0	It's not what I've got used to "Get Used to It" and "We won't stop" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music. Where's the energy? Where's the passion and love? Where's the catchy music? How I miss TBNH from Shelter and Brother & Sister!!
0	Try this idea for the Yank market, Jon Don't offer this release as an album and make us buy an overpriced CD single with it to get the Christmas disc. Instead, bring the "3 Ships" album back out with however many of these songs will fit as "bonus tracks". From what most customers are saying here, this release was a dud. Fortunately I still have the LP version of "Ships" that they really seem to want. Today I dug it out, made MP3s and burned that to a CDR. Which I will gladly destroy when I see "3 Ships (bonus tracks" show up here for me to buy. This may be non-PC, but can I get an Ay-men?
1	Truly Great Album I love this Album. Thats all. Anyway I can not stop listening to this CD. I listened to this only CD for four straight hours on a roadtrip. I still am not tired of this CD. Theres still little lyrics I have missed. If someone reading this does not buy the CD, there is seriously something wrong with you. Because its the best CD ever.
0	Please make it stop!! I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song "Good is Good" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned "crimes" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some "SOUL." Peace
1	music in the movie great music. great movie. when they enter the garage for the first time, before the first race, what is the music playing, any direction would be greatly appriciate
0	Very boring I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love
0	no, no, No, No, NO, NO DAMMIT!!! (Slams linear book down in fustration) (Rating 4 out of 10- -2 stars) Hey, I love the West Coast, as well as California (hope to live there one day). I believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game, and try to support anything that they do. But you do not know how mad I am at this album! When I heard The Dogg Pound was comming with a new album, I couldn't wait to cop it, because comming from some veterans from the west coast (my favorites I might add), I had HIGH expectations from this. This was a very dissapointing album. I guess the flaws are right in my face. I really don't want to accept the fact that the West Coast fell off, and I keep beliving that they're going to get back on their feet, but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards. Basically the spotlight reviewer "Constant" made the perfect statement about this album. This trio's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song "Sittin On 23's". It's like each member tries to rhyme, and they do okay at some points, but fail most of the time. Songs like "Hard On A Hoe" & "Fake***hoes" are just horrible. The album name "Cali Iz Active" you'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album, but they didn't. Lady Of Rage, RBX, Nate Dogg, and Ice Cube appear on this, but the fact that David Banner, P. Diddy, Pall Wall are on this damages the albums image. Also as many reviewers have stated, they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992. Now thats a huge problem. There are some good tracks on this here, and when I say "good", I mean they barely pass as listenable. I believe the self titled track "Cali Iz Active" was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot, as I hoped that it would be like that on the album. Although many of the beats are not west coast like, they are still a little nodding like "Keep It Gangsta" although Lady Of Rage outshines Kurupt and Daz. "It's All Hood" is one of those "good" songs on here (as I meantioned what I meant by "good"). Overall, this is not a good album. To me this is a HUGE dissapointment. I denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album, but as I heard it over and over again, it got worse and worse. If anyone remembers when the West was on top of the rap game, knows that this is not the way you bring it back. New listeners, who are unfamiliar of it's domination might like this album. I can't accept this at all. Lyrics: C Production: C- Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: D Overall: C- Favorite Tracks: Cali Iz Active, Slow Your Roll, Don't Sweat It, Honorable Mention Tracks: Keep It Gangsta, Throwin Up Da C
0	Where are the Peel Sessions? I don't understand why they didn't include the 6 extra John Peel Sessions that appeared on the original UK CD
1	A-W-E-S-O-M-E I always love William Finn, and 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee is no exception. The show is full of funny character songs like "I'm Not That Smart" and "Woe is Me," but it also has real show pieces with "The I Love You Song" and "My Favorite Moment of the Bee." This show perfectly highlights Finn's ability to create quirky comedies with big hearts. It seems to always be in my CD player
0	What is this even called? Seriously, is there ANYONE who can tell me just what the hell this album is supposed to be called? *Sigh*, these idiots don't even know how to spell properly. Anyway, this album, by far, is probably the worst of all the Lil' John attrocities, which is saying a lot since Lil' John really is a horrible artist
1	bee gees no. 1's the album had all the great beegees song . they are just what i wante
0	Yngwie Malmsteen (amazing guitarist) hit the nail on the head To quote him, (in the new issue of Revolver magazine), he said... "I call it CRAP! It really disgusts me when it starts creeping into heavy metal. Mozart once said 'Music is melody; melody is music.' Talking into a microphone over a drum machine isn't musical! Rap has no melody, so it's not music. It is completely an utterly devoid of any talent. I'm repulsed the media glorifies it so much." You're 1000000000000000000% correct man, keep up the good work. For good rap, listen to Ice-T and Public Enemy. For good music in general, listen to Yngwie Malmsteen's solo work
0	Remastered? And what for? I'd have expected some noise reduction in the songs of the first CD (for example, try The Partisan). The original recordings were noisy. This remastered version keeps all the noise, but now the sound is even poorer than in previous releases. All in all, the selected songs are a good representation of Cohen's musical career
1	Some shoegazing going on here. My wife and I saw this band at Slim's in San Francisco Saturday night and I must tell you, there was some definite shoegazing going on. For those of you who don't know what shoegazing is, I'll explain it as simple as possible. Picture the band standing on stage, staring down at their shoes (hence the term, "shoegazing") as they release a continuous hum of fuzz and distortion from their guitars. When it's done right, as Film School does, it can be very powerful. The floors, tables, chairs, and even my chest was vibrating to the sound. Film School is much more than this, however. In most songs, their shoegazing is limited to just portions of the song. The songs are broken up by wonderful vocal melodies, baselines, and guitar picking. You will hear what I mean when you listen to this album. Highly recommended
0	pure non funk 2 funk is that kinda vibe you eat hotwings and groove at fish fries funk is when you come out of church's chicken jamming, sorry but half this cd is not funk, d train is bubblegum pop, gap band outstanding is not funky enough, but hits, why is queen on here they was not a funk group, the whispers no way hose, carl carlton's she's a bad mama jama is not a funk classic, i always said these funk compilations does the artists injustice, if you wanna learn what funk is check out the original recordings well i'll list a few, the entire catalog, and entourage of james brown, parliament-funkadelic, sly stone, larry graham, bootsy collins, barkays, ohio players, chaka khan and rufus, cameo,curtis mayfield, mandrill, earth, wind fire, war, the list is endless
0	Beware: Don't use in slot loading multi-disc CD players There was a post from another reviewer about waiting for jams in slot-loading players...well, here you go. I would love to buy this CD, but I can't, because the new Fiona Apple DualDisc jammed my six-disc Rockford Fosgate in my 2005 Nissan when I put it in my player in the record store parking lot! And it took two months to have my CD player replaced. Anyone who buys this format must know you are taking a 50-50 chance in damaging your CD player. I had to buy Fiona again on iTunes and then burn a cd for my car. A real ripoff. I hate giving Bruce one star, but this rating will get others to read this post and hopefully not ruin their Nissan car stereos
1	Nearly the ultimate edition of classic album &quot;The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; appeared and disappeared with nary a trace when it was first released in 1968. Overshadowed by &quot;The White Album&quot; (The Beatles), Beggar's Banquet (The Stones)and other major releases, it seemed horribly out of step with its time when it was first released. That's because, as was often the case with The Kinks, it was. &quot;Village Green&quot; preceded the move back to the pastoral sounds and eagerness to recapture the innocence of the past by about twenty years. It sounds surprisingly fresh and vital now even if some the production occasionally sounds dated. That only adds to its charm. Now expanded to fill three CDs (as it should have been when Castle/Essential remastered and re-released the album a couple of years ago), &quot;Village Green&quot; has never sounded so great and so complete. While it has a few glaring omissions (most notably &quot;She's Got Everything&quot; which Davies didn't really want on this album along with a couple of other tracks that were originally slated for but withdrawn from the finished line up), this is about as complete a representation as were going to get of the material recorded during the 1966-1968 time frame when &quot;Village Green&quot; was recorded. Lovingly restored and remastered under the supervision of Andrew Sandoval (how does Andy get all these great jobs?)with remastering done by the magical Bill Inglot and Dan Hirsch at Digiprep, &quot;Village Green&quot; sparkles and sounds the best it ever has on CD. Disc one focuses on the original stereo version of the album. A better sounding version of this edition has never appeared before (although the Japanese K2 remaster sounded pretty darn close). We also get bonus tracks featuring a single A side from the time &quot;Days&quot; and the stereo alternate mixes that appeared on the withdrawn 12 track edition of &quot;Village Green&quot;. We &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot; (stereo version)as well. Disc two features the mono version of the album. Since the mixes differ slightly, hardcore Kinks fans will want both versions. On the mono version we also get bonus tracks as well including the mono version of &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, &quot;Berkeley Mews&quot; and a no strings version (the earliest from 1966)of &quot;Village Green&quot; to close out the CD. Disc three is the one that will have fans salivating. The &quot;rarities&quot; disc as it's subtitled features a number of tracks previously unavailable (offically and unoffically) on CD plus tracks that have never been released. We get the following stereo &quot;rarities&quot;; &quot;Misty Water&quot; (and also the mono version which hasn't been released before), &quot;Berkeley Mews&quot;, &quot;Easy Come(previously unreleased on CD), There You Went&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (alternate stereo mix previously unreleased), &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot; (an alternate stereo remix), &quot;Did you See His Name&quot;, &quot;Mick Avory's Underpants&quot;(an instrumental previously unreleased), &quot;Lavender Hill&quot;, &quot;Rosemary Rose&quot;, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, &quot;Spotty Grotty Anna&quot;, &quot;Where Did My Spring Go?&quot;, &quot;Groovy Movies&quot;, &quot;Creeping Jean&quot;(and unreleased longer, stereo mix), &quot;King Kong&quot;. We also get the following mono tracks including &quot;Misty Water&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot; (a BBC session remix), &quot;Animal Farm(A BBC sesion remix), &quot;Days&quot;(A BBC session remix)and &quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot; (a mono instrumental mix). A note on the &quot;rarities&quot;--many of these were previously available on &quot;The Great Lost Kinks Album&quot; and on bootlegs but never with sound this good. Also, the BBC sessions are, like many from the time, the instrumental backing with some new vocals dubbed on. They don't sound significantly different from the original versions but collectors will want them. The deluxe packaging features a booklet with new comments from Ray, Dave, Pete and Mick on the making of the album and various tracks. We also get a discussion on the genesis and difficulties that the album faced. Sandoval also co-authors a brief synposis with info drawn from Doug Hinman's excellent book on The Kinks that discusses when the various recordings were made, differences between them and the process of putting together the album. &quot;Village Green&quot; is presented in a deluxe digipak accordian fold out sleeve. Sure, it's missing a few key album tracks but, really, this is as good as it gets when dealing with the corporate world and the compromises of reissuing classic albums.
1	Barbara Cook I have pretty well all of her cd's and dvd's so this extra one from her concert at Carnegie Hall this year was especially welcome. Her voice is still terrific - some of the songs she sings bring tears to your eyes and others fill you with joy. This is an album to treasure and hear again and again. Thank you Barbara!
1	hidden in plain view delivers a stellar debut! the new album "life in dreaming" is a spectacular debut from hidden in plain view. definitely one of the best albumS of 2005 so far and will probably be in the top 10 of the year. the album is full of catchy hooks, tight riffs, double bass, and the singing is excellent. every song is full of emotion and you can really see some talent in this young band. i would say they sound like a mix between taking back sunday and senses fail. i admit that this album isn't anything new to the scene and they're very emoish but i think hipv will definitely make a dint in this already overcrowded scene. my only complaint is that the new version of "twenty below" isn't as good as it was on their ep, but it's still good. hipv don't really bring nething new to the table but their music is heartfelt and is a solid emo/punk record. definitely worth your money.
0	Ying Yang Twins - Me & My Brother Yea I agree, these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name, if you could even call these guys artists. This album is strictly made for clubs, and for BET and MTV watchers and mainstream listeners. This is radio music, and stuff you would hear in the clubs. Thats all this music is good for. It has no creativity. The production on this album isnt bad, but lyrics, come on, you cant call these lyrics. I suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener. No top 5 for this album
0	Sorry..but they're no Pentangle I've tried very hard with this album since its release, but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here. The incredible string band, pentangle, Bread, love and dreams comparisons are, in my opion, wishful thinking. This isn't due to Espers ability as song writers, but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere. This ruins what is otherwise a nice album
0	Listen to Cohen himself! It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs. Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there? It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs. Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire! Please ...
0	Don't see them live. It will ruin it. Dear Animal Collective, I am mad at you for letting me drive two hours from home to be amongst your smelly patchouli stinking fans. I can't say I was happy when you guys to came out on stage and were completely ridiculous and well.....goofy. I never thought I would experience something that is the closest thing to a hippy rave, that I can think of. I was not impressed by all the crazy vocal effects you guys used. It sort of reminded me of that 16 year old kid messing around at guitar center. I noticed your almost dub/reggae influences...That upset me. I am even more upset by the white boy tribal thing you have going. I noticed that you guys don't sound anything like your albums. I noticed that the subtle things on the albums are exaggerated when played live to the point at where they are unenjoyable. I will have to listen to Sung Tongs again and see if holds up to your crazy live antics. Seriously, I get the feeling your producer saved you. I hope that I can still enjoy your stuff without horrible flashbacks from tonight
1	William Shatner, you are so cool Brilliant, hilarious, and fun to listen. I think that "You'll Have Time" is one of my favorite songs of all time. Who ever would have guessed that about an album by ... William Shatner? He has a fine sense of self-parody, and the album is very well produced. William Shatner, you are so cool
1	Why Ask Why Why do some people try to analyze what songs Neil decides to play. Just enjoy an excellent CD. For the ones who don't think Crazy Horse is a good band, listen to their first album. It would be a hit today on alternative country stations. Danny Whitten was a very good song writer, and his songs have been recorded by Three Dog Night, Rod Stewart, and The Indigo Girls to name a few. There is not a bad song on this CD. If you don't like C'mon Baby it's probably because you never had the man shine his light in your eyes. Keep these great releases coming
0	PLEASE! i bought this CD because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it. but little did i know that they are all, ALL bad versions of them! you can't even sing along! this CD sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS CD
1	Good one-disc compilation. This John Lennon compilation is really good, except that I wish "I'm Losing You" had been included. Other than that, it does a good job of showcasing his hits and then some. The sound is great and I'd recommend this to anyone that just wants one, one-disc John Lennon compilation
0	where is the BEST song on this whole soundtrack? I'm not buying this CD because I just found out it's Mortal Coil's track which is missing which completely ruins the whole CD. That song is SO beautiful. Why is it not on the CD? That's why I'm giving it one star although the other music used was highly effective
1	Stunning. Simply stunning score. The theme is possibly the most moving track you will come across in years. You can not hear it through without your eyes watering and every inch of your skin turns to goose flesh. By far James Newton Howard's best score to date; although his score for Signs should be hard to top, he has done it
1	Gerald Albright Is On Fire Here! This is Gerald's latest effort,and I must say,it is a real smooth jazz gem.Gerald really lets it fly here,with jazzy energy everywhere.There isn't a dud on the entire album!While you may have heard of the popular single from this album on the radio,the funky "To The Max",there is more to this album than just funk.While there are a number of funky,upbeat and groovy tunes on this album,such as "4 On The Floor","ToThe Max","Throw Yo' Hands In The Air",and"On The One",there are also an equal amount of more standard,traditional smooth jazz stylings as well.Not like its a bad thing,far from it,because these tunes help to balance the album out and more,keeping it from going stale.Some of the more standard tunes on the album are,"Why Georgia","Walker's Theme",and "Father's Lullaby",which Gerald produced in remembrance of his late father.However,even the not so funky tunes shine here,with one of the best examples being Gerald's nice cover version of "Why Georgia".There is also a vocal track on the album,"Condition Of My Heart",performed by a former "Boyz To Men" member.While the album as a whole is great,the best picks are,"4 On The Floor","To The Max","Why Georgia","Throw Yo' Hands In The Air","On The One",and "If You Don't Know Me By Now".If you are looking for an exceptional sax player,then look no further,because you just found one.This album should be in everyone's smooth jazz collection.I highly recommend it
1	Iceland strikes again! What a unique and scary CD!! :) Minus hails from Iceland, the land of rocky tundra and quirky rock groups (Sugarcubes, Bjork, Sigur Ros, Mum, etc.) none of which can hold a candle to meeting the intensity of Minus. This is bar none the most unusual hardcore metal album I have ever heard and I'm LOVING it! Yes it's screamy (well most of it), but it's very melodic with tons of tempo changes to keep you on your feet. Mainstream metal this ain't and it isn't for the faint of heart. If you're into Slipknot and need a bit more attitude (!!) or more complexity and layers, this might be up your alley! Give it a try! [Fave tracks: Pulse, Frat Rock and Misdo
1	BeBe &amp; CeCe's best Nearly every song on the album is up to the same high standard set by the title track, &quot;Heaven.&quot; The tunes are memorable, the instrumentals enhance the vocals rather than being barely-noticeable fillers, and the lyrics are a refreshing change from the hackneyed lyrics one often gets on Christian radio stations. As one of the other reviewers has said, this drew criticism from some, but anyone who listens carefully will see that the Christianity is there. It's subtle rather than in-your-face, and thus doesn't get tiresome. &quot;Heaven&quot; is an album that can and should be listened to over and over
0	what happened? I bought this cd when it first came out as a huge HRC fan. Vagrant records also has a quality track record judging from their band roster and their ability to somehow summon up the best of a band. I thought HRC would benefit from much higher production quality as well as the influence of oustanding acts such the Alkaline Trio and Saves the Day surrounding them.. However, owning for the cd for nearly two years with many listens has made realize that the band used to create captiving, listenable hardcore is gone. Nothing about this cd particularly interesting or grabbed me even on the first listen. The disc loses its appeal early as nameless, medtempo pop crowds the speakers. The vocals are more clear, however; the trade off is less compelling melodies and a lack of creativity. Tracks like &quot;the Pharmacist&quot; identify a theme of short, competent, but boring songs. I haven't heard anything more form HRC released this album and I don't think i would shell out 15 bucks again for something I would hear on the radio
0	dont waste your money Wack cd. Low quality producer/s and talent. except for about 2 or 3 artists (rakim & ken-y being the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 stars) this whole compilation is a complete waste of your time and money. If you value your hard earned money then may i suggest "Los Kambumbos". it is a compilation of high quality produced by dj Jova and it includes a pantheon of quality artists including; trebol clan, khriz & angel, Nicky Jam, Tito el bambino and more.
1	This is The Album 80s , 90s and so far have observed a lack of true classic albums, i mean really true classic albums not that one microwaved bands glorified by the rolling stone magazine, MTV and the whole media, just think about it what albums come to your mind when you think or you discuss with your friends regarding classic albums? Beatles revolver? , any Bob Dillan work?, Presley sun sessions? Zeppelin? of course right? but try to think of any classic album after the 70s and you will have troubles i bet my ass, well, Smiths The Queen is Dead at least is one repply to this matter, because the sober and at the same melancholic mood along with the charming and calm voice of Stephen Patrick Morrisey, the Jhonny Marr deligthfull strings and beautifull lyrics made not only of "The Queen is Dead" but all Smiths albums gorgeous collectible pieces of British contemporary music, elegance and refinement are the basic elements of their music, "frankly Mr. Shankly" is one of my faves, "i know its over" , "the boy with the torn in its side" you name it!!!! this album can be easily included into 80s few classics. HM
1	Asprin won't bring a dead hooker back to life ... ... so stop trying. Dave Attell is dirty, dirty fun. Attell is ten times dirtier than anything Andrew Dice Clay ever even considered, but he's at least one hundred times funnier
0	Not Very Good At All I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew. Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value. This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century..
1	Magnificent!!! Bravo Horowitz!! I remember hearing all about this concert in Moscow when I was a kid. Whatever I thought - so some old guy played in Mosocw. Well, reader you must forgive me for my stupidity, because for some time I realize the greatness of Maestro Horowitz, and the importance of his playing in Moscow, his hometown and homeland after 60 years. I bought this album because I remember the hoopla in 1986. I was not dissapointed. The playing is emotional and incredible. Horowitz really was an amazing piano player - the ability to hold rapture over the audience is captured here. Those fingers -connected to a difficult, sole-eating, slight, Russian man - were magic. Wow. Those beautiful notes he plays hold in the air like ripe fruit. A master at work! This was an inspired performance by a magician on the ivories. If your wondering what the fuss was about, or you want a CD that expresses how classical music can move the soul - then I recommend this CD very highly. Along with the Three Tenors IN Concert, it just has some inherent quality to move you. Horowitz may have made better studio recordings, and better live recordings, but I am convinced this is just a good. I join along with the gentleman who can be heard yelling "BRAVO" at the conclusion of several pieces. BRAVO!
0	Just buy the good songs off of iTunes first off, I'm into all the emo/screamo/alternative stuff. The Used, Senses Fail, Underoath, all of it. But this CD just doesn't cut it. It's not that it's bad, the songs just arent that interesting. Many of the songs just seem to have the same part it. The singer holding a note with the drummer riding on the double-bass pedal with mindless gutiar. of course tha's nto teh hole song. But each song seems to have that part in it. There a few good songs, like secrets don't make friends, and a few others. But it's not worth getting the whole CD. Just buy the good ones off of iTunes
0	Ew I was listening to this and the person's voice is awful. He's not even like on tune. It's very annoying
0	Waste of money! This soundtrack is terrible, and I have loved most of Vangelis work for more than twenty years. The only good cut is "Titans" dont waste time on the rest.
0	The Duke Meets The Earl I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record
1	Williams does an Irish turn Once again John Williams shows why he is so sought after as a soundtrack composer. Anyone who has heard of this movie knows that it focuses on a young Irish couple seeking a new life in turn-of-the-century America, and Williams immerses himself so thoroughly in that reality that you almost feel as if you're listening to a CD by one of the many Celtic groups like Clannad or Gaelic Storm, only without the vocals. From the triumphant to the contemplative to the pugnacious to the lively rhythm of the jig, every aspect of the Irish musical character is here. (You may find that you have to turn up the volume: for some reason it isn't recorded at a particularly listenable level!) There are also moments (as in &quot;Shannon is Shot&quot;) when Williams's own voice, so familiar to us from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies and his many other triumphs, makes a surprise appearance. Once the characters have reached the West (&quot;Oklahoma Territory,&quot; &quot;The Land Race&quot;) he blends his recurring Irish themes with a musical motif that suggests the newness and astonishing size of the country and the many adjustments the young pioneers have to make. I can't help wondering what Williams would be able to do with a &quot;real&quot; Western (why didn't Kevin Costner hire him for &quot;Open Range,&quot; for instance?). An impressive example of a great composer's work
1	Cruel Intentions Theme The theme played throughout the film is by Edward Shearmur, who also did numerous scores for motion pictures like "The Count Of Monte Cristo", "K-Pax" and "Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"
0	I can't believe how bad this is I used to listen the Dream Theater "back in the day" so I thought I'd check them out. I can't believe how bad this CD is. Am I glad I didn't pay full price for this. What a boring, pretentious pice of crap
0	Isreal Symphomy Ochrester Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him
1	Hands-down classic hip-hop album From the first few bars, this album grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. It's a little abstract, and might take a few listens to grow on you, but it's the perfect meld of classic hip-hop beats and robot-march production. After this album, El-P's tracks got a little distracting, to me at least, but "The Cold Vein" blends seamlessly. The lyrical tag-team work of Vast Aire and Vordul is also something to marvel at. Dense, dense poetics, with metaphors and symbolism crammed into every verse; they often sound like they're cursing, even though they're not. In the first cut, "Iron Galaxy," Vast paints a bleak picture of New York that sets the gritty tone for the rest of the album: "Let's talk in laymen's terms/rotten apples and big worms/early birds and poachers/New York is evil at its core/So those who have more than them/Prepare to be victims/Ate up by vultures/Politicians in a dog-eat-dog culture/That'll sic 'em." Throughout the album, a dark, violent undercurrent runs through each song, from the syncopated "Vein" to the angelic stomp "A B-Boy's Alpha" to the brilliant closer, "Pigeon." Of course, it's not for everybody. There is not one club-ready beat on the whole LP, and those who are going from the window to the wall will probably miss a lot of the clever one-liners and metaphors, but real heads recognize, and "The Cold Vein" is something a lot of MC's could learn from
1	Oh Me, Oh My! Dylan goes country and he does it well. This is a record far too short. Good songs here, but not enough of them. It seems like you've just put the CD in the player and it's over. But other than the fact that there isn't as much music here as on a normal Dylan CD, I have no complaints. Dylan is in fine voice here, sort of a country, high pitched twang that works very nicely. He tells these songs of love and loss with such sincerity, such honesty. But then he attacks everything he does that way, so it should be no surprise. This is just a wonderful, if a bit too short, record
1	getting better and better i was a little disappointed with the go-betweens comeback album, friends of rachel worth, it seemed to lack direction, the songs were too muddled (and in robert's contribution just plain dull and silly). but on this record they have supassed themselves. wonderful melodies, great lyrics, good, emotive delivery: at the moment i'd put it up there as my favorite g-b's album, which is saying something after nearly 25 years in the business
0	Elevator Music Don't recognize the names of any of these DJ's? For good reason; their talent is non-existant
0	Mediocre rock group, manufactured album I've listend to the cd several times, since I realize that some get better with listening. I don't hate it. But it is nowhere near being even "good". Whoever wrote this band is as good as the White Stripes should burn in a musically igonorant hell
0	All due respect... but the flame's died down . I got into AFI with the release of Art of Drowning, which is a fantastic album. My girlfriend at the time had Black Sails in the Sunset and even though I didn't really get into it then, I now think it rivals AOD. AFI has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress (this is highly commendable). These two albums, which formed my introduction to AFI, now stand as the mid-part of their career. The band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what's cool. They've always been unique. Their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80's and early 90's hardcore punk scene. Davey Havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says, "Ever since I can remember I wanted to be in a hardcore band," at the beginning of the "He Who Laughs Last" video. These albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene. When the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark (it was there in the early days, though, in songs like Brownie Bottom Sundae). These middle albums (haloween ep and self-titled included) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound. Moreover, I've yet to hear a band in the world of punk (past and present) who's music rivals this intensity. I appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level; they continue to break the mold (the goth glam influence is pretty cool). Besides, who can say they didn't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on Black Sails and AOD. But, personally, it's pretty difficult to listen to Decemberunderground. AFI deserves all the respect in the world but I don't feel much of the fire of the old days.
1	Great collection, but they missed one An excellent compilation of the darker side of classical music, although I would have preferred a different rendition of Toccata and Fugue in D (New York Philharmonic perhaps), it's still quite good. But how could the series producer leave off Ravel's Pavane For a Dead Princess? It's preferable to Symphonie Fantastique - March to The Scaffold, plus Berlioz already makes an appearance with Dream of a Witches' Sabbath. If there was room, Verdi's Requiem would have been a nice addition too. So I have to go with 4 stars only
1	From tragedy comes triumph "Of Malice & The Magnum Heart" is basically a farewell to two friends of the band who died in a horrific car accident. Throughout this entire album, you can feel the hurt, pain, and anger of the days following the tragedy. A very good album, and one that needs to be listened to by anyone who has ever lost loved ones in their life
0	boringest band ever I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do..
1	A Beautiful Winter Garden Having already recorded a full-length Christmas album, "To Drive The Cold Winter Away," Loreena McKennitt went into Peter Gabriel's Real World studios for three days with some musicians in July 1995 to record five Christmas songs just for fun. The end result is the Christmas EP, "A Winter Garden." Just 22 minutes long, "A Winter Garden" can easily be taken as a companion disc to "To Drive The Cold Winter Away." Loreena & company perform this quintet of holiday songs beautifully, especially the gorgeous, nearly-7 minute rendering of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," easily one of the very best versions of this classic song ever recorded. There are also spirited performances of "Coventry Carol," "Good King Wenceslas," "Snow" (originally featured on "To Drive The Cold Winter Away"), and "Seeds Of Love." "A Winter Garden" is a lovely holiday postcard from Loreena McKennitt.
1	Pete Townshend's Turntable Ok, this LP must have been on Pete Townshend's turntable day and night. Listen to the first track and you'll hear where "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" came from. In fact, the Riley in "Baba O'Riley" IS Terry Riley. - Vincent G. Marin
1	Good Collection of songs Eddie Cochran rocks, This is a must have for any Rockabilly fan or any fan of Rock n Roll........The real stuff. It's too bad he had to die at such a young age, it would've been nice if he could've been around to make more great music, with songs like "Jeanie Jeanie Jeanie", "Somethin' Else", "Come on everybody", "Guybo", "Summertime Blues", "Twenty Flight Rock", and my personal favorite "Bolweevle" (don't know if thats spelled right, but its a really cool song). This is an Enjoyable album from start to finish, this is the way rock n roll is supposed to sound
1	WOWWOWWOWWOW This is the first cd that I have bought this year and been completely blown away. Everything on this album is awesome. I haven't taken it out of my cd player since I picked it up on Tuesday. These guys are primed to blow up! I can't wait to see them play live it's going to be great. Anyways the whole cd is great. I love the crunchy guitars and heavy drumming. I can't believe how amazing this band is. Congrats are in order to Metal Blade for getting these guys. The band reminds me of an early Killswitch Engage right before their second album took off. I really expect similar things from WS. To think that this album is as good as it is is surprising. I remember hearing these guys on a compliation and not thinking all that highly of them, but after getting a sample mp3 on Metal Blade's website I decided I had to get this cd and I haven't been disappointed. This album should be on everyone's radar in the next couple of months, just watch. It took KSE's second album a little while to catch on but once it did, boom, it blew up. Just rest assured knowing that you had this album way before anyone else if you're smart enough to pick this up ASAP.
1	Made in China not her best, but still undeniably Juliana While this album doesn't reach the maturity and beauty of records such as Beautiful Creature nor does it flaunt the naivety of masterpieces such as Hey Babe nor does it reach the pop mastery of her recent Some Girls effort, it delicately floats among the three creating a brief, unwavering expression of true music. Made from base emotions and raw vocals and instruments, this is quite a unique Juliana record indeed. Has Juliana become a bit too jaded for her own good? Maybe, but who cares, there are some truly catchy songs on here, such as Stay Awake. All these angry, grungy, alternative mainstream chick rockers you are hearing now on top 20 countdowns across the world, were invariably influenced by this wonderful songwriter. For anyone else, I might dismiss her often childish lyrics and emotions, but she has proven that she is real the deal, endearing us with her honest feelings more than pushing us away. But these aren't the reasons I'm telling you to listen to this album, it's because she is still the Juliana we know and love, just a little older and perhaps a little more bitter. She is still the one making us hum her songs at work, on the bus, whereever we may be. She is ornery pop music taken directly and unedited from the heart. I would have loved a few more "quiet" songs, but I'm sure she'll take care of that on her next album -- think Juliana's Pony but way better, all the songs have a harder edge than her last few albums. With each new listen, Made in China becomes that much better, revealing a definite evolution of her one-of-a-kind sound. If this is your first time with her, then go back and listen to the beginning (Blake Babies on up) and you can experience an artist that is rewarding and refreshing to listen to
0	Separation Sunday this is not..... I enjoyed Separation Sunday tremendously, an original (although not for everyone) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match. As a thitrysomething, I found the lyrics on Sep. Sun. to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time, with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood, or reaching your own "resurrection". This new album (Boys and Girls) is much more drab, with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that I would be emarrased to listen to if I were older than 20. These are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the MTV generation, with cheesy lines and hooks. I had thought this band was the real deal, and had argued as such, but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers.
1	I Like It My parents loved John so I am familiar to a degree with his music and the special sound of his voice. I think this CD sounds good and I like the selection of songs. What else can one say? You like it or you don't for one reason or another. I like it and listen to it and that's just me. Enjoy what we are given and what remains
1	pet rocks are neat i dunno why this album's so cheap, but i figure they just wanted more people to hear the good music on it. lots of bang for your buck, these are some great songs if you like college rock kind of stuff. i guess it kind of reminds me of the strokes. doesn't really sound like that though
0	Travesty The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this!
0	Juelz should be missing his tongue Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money
0	What happend to the BTNH we used to know? I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time.
1	Possibly The Best Experimental Jazz Record Ever Made..... There really isn't much you can say but totally unpredictable and absolutely ingenius from start to finish. One of those rare records that keeps you on the edge of your seat and you find yourself saying about every other minute "How the hell did he think of that?". The ideas are bountiful and over the top brilliant. Every record collection should have at least one copy of Can Tago Mago, Captain Beefheart Trout Mask Replica and Naked City by John Zorn. Amazing stuff
1	Smooth Jazz with a Bounce I had never heard of Tom Braxton before this CD and boy was I pleasantly surprised. This is definitely a nice album to listen to
0	Shut Up and Play! Eric Johnson is as talented a guitar player as God ever put on this earth. His chords and notes are so clean, it defies belief. You wonder out loud how someone could master an instrument as well as he does. Growing up in Austin, I have had the chance to see him numerous times, and my opinion of him has not changed in 20 years, he can't sing! I am sorry, but Eric has always had this desire to be a pop star. So many people in Austin just cringe at concerts when he stops rocking, so that he can sing one of his sappy lyrics. It is a waste. Now don't jump on me! I love the guy! But I wish he would stick to playing guitar and quit the singing. The guy just has so much talent
0	One Great Song among many bad ones. I bought this CD thinking I love the song Schism so even if the rest of the CD is just OK it will be worth the money. I was wrong. The CD is just boring. With the exception of Schism the entire CD is forgettable. This was the first Tool CD I have ever bought and it's also the last
0	please note all the five-star reviews by kids Remember the style of music that came out in the late 70's called Punk? The pioneers of this type of music were bands such a Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and the Talking Heads. The style becamse somewhat funk-influenced to the gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds of The Dead Kennedies and Ministry. Even Social Distortion had their own little sound to offer. This is how it went through the 80's. Yet, after the who Nirvana-mania that saved music from Whitesnake and Warrent, Punk, as well as many other sounds, seemed lost until... Green Day comes around with "Dookie." This continued the punk sound into what we know today. So in the words of Oasis: "Where did it all go wrong." It's not that this sounds on it's own is bad. When Blink 182 first came out, they had a lot of fun to offer. But gawd, where do we draw the line? After that, we had ( in no particular order) Sum 41, New Found Glory, My Chemical Romance, Showoff, and jeez, I could go on forever. They all sound so much alike. Still they were once tolerable. But with simple plan, (sigh), enough is enough. I can't even tell the difference sometimes between these guys and Bowling For Soup. And I don't easily confuse bands. Really, though, these guy call themselves Punk. But last time I checked, Punk was about rebellion, Anarchy, disatisfaction with where humanity is going, all that stuff. Ex Sex Pistols "Anarchy In The UK" or Ramones "I'm Against It." Now Listen to some of the titles off this: "I'm Just A Kid," "God Must Hate Me," "I'd Do Anything." Difference? You'd have to be blind not to see one. These guys have jumped on the "poser" bandwagon that every other "punk" band on a major label has jumped on, and thus, mainstream punk is doing the same thing heavy Metal is
1	An awesome CD This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. There's no songs on here that I don't like. All of them are great. Especially I'm Just a Kid, I'd Do Anything, and Perfect. I reccomend this to anyone who likes bands such as Yellowcard, The All-American Rejects, and blink-182 or anyone who is looking for some good music to listen too
0	Awful Compilation CD - No Original Artists Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money
0	2-1/2 stars -- MY 700th REVIEW! WHEE!!! After the success of Kamikaze, many diehard Twista fans accused him of having sold out, because it wasn't until he hit the mainstream that he started seeing platinum sales. Love it or hate it, Twista tried to continue that essence with his follow-up, The Day After. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work as well. Most of the other two-star reviews are pretty accurate (especially Constant and Norris' respective reviews). I think it can be assumed that the day after is Women's Day because Twista is spending most of the album rapping to the ladies (LL Cool J, anyone?). Not only that, but in some places it's a little too obvious that he's trying to recapture the magic of "Slow Jamz". The lead single "Girl Tonite" is the most obvious example of this, especially since Twist is once again naming balladeers and their respective songs. Also, am I the only one to find it a little odd that Twista says "When I touch her, she like" and then TREY says "Oh"? (Think about it a minute.) Another example is an obligatory Neptunes track called "Lavish", where Twista proves that he can't always rap over a slow beat. Yet another song for the ladies that fails is "So Lonely" featuring Mariah Carey. I don't know what's up with Mimi's voice on the song, but she kind of sounds like a wannabe version of herself. Speaking of weird hooks, "Had to Call" features a chorus sung by somebody named Sleepy Eyed Jones, and he sounds like, well, it's kind of like the equivalent to how DJ Premier would sound if he tried to sing. There are also some songs that badly use samples, especially the aptly titled "Do Wrong" (with Lil' Kim), which borrows a sample from Al Green's "Love & Happiness". And "I'm a Winner" terribly samples R. Kelly's "One Me", and if that's not bad enough, Twista is even repeating some of the lines he used in "Girl Tonite". But things aren't much better when he's NOT kickin' it to the females: the title track doesn't go anywhere, and Syleena Johnson's hook adds nothing to the song. "Heartbeat" is a little too violent (especially because the song opens with a long round of shots), and "Check That H*" has a wack chorus. And "Holding Down the Game" is a bling-blingin' song that is unnecessarily screwed and chopped in the middle of it -- and anyway, if you wanted to hear someone rapping slowly, you wouldn't pick up a Twista album, would you? The only song really worth hearing on the whole album is "Get It How You Live". It's nice that Twista is still trying to do his thing, but I heard this album one day last week and then I had no desire to listen to it again the day after. Anthony Ruper
0	Should have changed name, simple as that. This band claiming to be hopesfall is not! There is only one original member left, they should of changed their name with the release of atypes, no question. Atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in NC! I would have respected them if they changed their band name
0	Innovative in theory, but doesn't come together I must say before I write this review, I tried. I tried really hard to get into this album. I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, a fan of all Classic Rock for that matter. I got this CD for it's historical significance. It is, after all, the first Rock Opera. Anything you hear about this album being similar to The Wall by Pink Floyd is false. True, it is a rock opera that tells the story of a troubled individual, but it doesn't get as advanced or deep as Pink Floyd does. There are a few key problems that get in the way of this goal. The music. Original as it may be, The Who's strange melodies and instrumentation don't do anything for me. The melodies are for the most part, predictable. When they try to go out on a limb, it fails and sounds forced. The guitar parts and solos sound thin, and although a big part of it is probably because the master tapes were ceremoniously burned and the recording isn't prime quality, I'm sure a lot of it has to do with a mediocre recording job. It has it's moments, for example, the first few secconds of "Smash the Mirror". But on the whole, it sounds almost like amateurs. The songs. Not trying to rag on any diehard townshend fans, but the songs seem to be forced into the Opera mold. While this may make it more of a true "rock opera" than "The Wall", for example, it doesn't make for a very easy listen. The horrible thing is that it IS possible to write songs in opera form and have them flow. Exhibit A: Queen's "A Night at the Opera". Although Queen's superb tracking skills probably helped their case a lot. Which leads me into my next point. Lack of depth. While musicians who don't layer their songs with extra tracks and studio musicians generally appeal to me, they shouldn't try to make arena rock operas. The Who's attempts to make this work is very similar to asking the white stripes to make a rock opera. It can't be done effectively within the limits of the band. I did give this album two stars. One for an original concept that gave us so much in the long run, and another star for those few moments it has. Smash the Mirror (the introduction), Pinball Wizard and The Acid Queen are alright. There is a reason why those tracks are popular. I'm afraid that a lot of people aren't really analyzing this album and are just giving it five star ratings because it is "The Who", the band with the man who smashed his guitar onstage. If you are looking for a Rock Opera, I suggest "A Night at the Opera" or "The Wall". If you are looking for another "The Who" album, I would suggest some of their later works. "The Who Sells Out" was alright, certiantly better than this.
0	Why, India, Why???? I'm a massive, huge, big-time India fan. I have every release and have witnessed her powerful live performances from NYC to Miami, but I must say that I'm not feeling this cd. It sounds a bit rushed and her vocals seem to be recorded diffrently than usual, not as strong. I love the title track as well as "Cuando Hieres A Una Mujer" and "No Es Lo Mismo". That's 3 good ones out of 11 songs. This from an artist that has released cd's that you can listen to from beginning to end. I don't even know what to say about "Madre E Hija aka MADRE", although I think the sentiment is sweet, it's comes across corny. Now that we've lost Celia, I was hoping that she would raise the bar a bit and drop an unique, beautilfully produced cd. I figured she would snatch Salsa back from Reggaeton and create a classic in the vein of Ms. Cruz. I'm a bit dissapointed that she's still singing about lost love and scorned lovers. I thought after her great Sony release "Mi Alma y Mi Corazon" we'd get amazing material......and what happened with Sony anyway??? Now she's with Univision?!?! India-I still admire you and I'll always support your work.....spoken like a true fan.
1	Que buena musica! Esta cd es muey bueno. Pero, y piensa la mismo de los oltra personas. Los unas muy suave, son mala. Son bueno concions, pero son malas por esta cd de buena musica por bailar. Los oltra mas cds son perfectates por un fiesta or por manajas largos. This cd is great with the exception of the softer songs. I prefer those with the upbeat attitude like the one by Albita. I like her style. I highly recomend that you buy it
1	Purchased for the Husband I purchased this set for my husband after hearing him talk about it for quite some time. He is thrilled with it and plays it quite often. It is apparently a 'Must Have' for any Springsteen fan
0	the new rubbish its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it
1	Get This Album! It's Fantastic! I can't get enough of this music. The lyrics are great, the music hints of a cross between the best of the Police and the best of Peter Gabriel. If you ever loved these bands you'll love this. It's the most compelling music of its kind I've heard in a long time. Listen to &quot;I Fall To Pieces&quot; and you'll agree
0	I'm a tad disappointed... Let me start off by saying, I am a HUGE Beyonce fan, and I am not in any way "hating" on her.I love her voice, her stage presence, her look; I mean, the girl is BAD(in a good way)! Now, with that said, I really expected more from her. Like I've read in so many people's reviews, I heard 'Deja Vu' and I just KNEW this album was gonna be off the hook. However, that was not the case. I really like the strength and fierceness of B-Day (I'm all for female empowerment), but the songs seem really...sloppy in a way.Beyonce is a creative and talented songwriter,but on B-day its like she was writing for Keshia Cole (a simpler, more 'urban' style). Not saying that she doesn't appeal to the urban crowd, its just that Beyonce is a little more sophisticated than what she's showing us in B-Day. Dangerously in Love was a better album. She had dance songs, love songs, feel-good songs; it took you to so many places that few artists can go on an album. B-day did not do that for me. Beyonce has the potential to produce a great album; I'm looking forward to her next project. Sorry B, I still love you though
1	Fun! Fun! Fun! While I wish the disc clocked in longer than 35 minutes, it is crammed with fun songs that get you moving. The Come Ons do not have typical sound and I think anyone would enjoy this effort! Be sure to check out track 11 - I'll Show You Why - my personal fave
0	They were too lazy to score new music.... So the creators of this show paid a lot of money to various record companies to feature songs on the TV show soundtrack and hardly if ever used new music that they themselves would compose or not. It is really product placement of the worst kind. Be lazy and let other recording artists do the work for you, considering that this stupid show was made the way it was, it was not surpiseing that they reverted to this just to save money
1	Damn good. Better than her others I always liked Nelly Furtado for her originality but this new CD is very different than just about anything else out there. It's difficult to define a genre for it as it's very diverse. I wasn't sure if I would like it as I found her other CDs good but a little weird but on the contrary, I enjoyed the entire album. This is really a great album
0	BOrRRRRrrrrInG This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing
1	Romance is still alive in Shall We Dance CD and DVD I watch this movie over and over. The story is wonderful, the acting is great--who can resist Richard Gere's tiny smile towards his wife, Susan Sarandon. And this was my first intro to Jennifer Lopez who was excellent and a wonderful dancer. The music?? Well, I had to have the music; it is varied and it is romantic and uplifting and introduced me to Peter Gabriel and other music. You won't be sorry to buy this music--it makes you want to get up and dance slow and fast!! And if you are a little bit of an oldster, like me, it will bring back youthful and memorable feelings of romance and real love
0	I Am DSGB! Troy why did you put your name on this. This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it. I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh! I AM DSGB!
0	Very Disappointing Soft Psychedelia If you like warmed-over Syd Barrett, here's your guy. A few nice tunes but becomes monotonous very quickly. Stoltz can't sing worth a damn - I'd like this a lot more if his vocals were wiped and a real singer overdubbed
1	Outkast Does It Again - Another Classic Another 5-Star Classic from the hottest duo in the game. Standout tracks: So Fresh, So Clean - Ms. Jackson - Spaghetti Junction - but the single B.O.B. steals the show - so fresh and clean itself you might put it on loop for a few days before you listen to the rest of the album. This CD a definite must for any music collection regardless of your musical taste.
0	Superman Returns Soundtrack I didn't care for the sountrack nearly as much as I thought I would. It lacked the excitement of the movie
1	Perfect In Every Way Eazy-E is my favorite rapper and i find him highly underrated. He was easily the best member in NWA and the hype surrounding his death should have been much bigger. He is a one-of-a kind rap genius with a sound unlike anybody else. This album is a masterpiece and is perfect in every way. The opening song Still Talkin' is hilarious and Eazy drops freestyles that sound like he isnt even trying. To hear some of his best verses of all time check out No More ?s which is my absolute favorite song done by him ever. The album flows together beautifully and even the bonus songs at the end are funny including Merry Muthaf***in' Xmas which is classic. Other classics include Ruthless Villian, 2 Hard Mutha's, Boyz-N-The Hood Remix, Eazy-Duz-It and We Want Eazy. There is no doubt in my mind that he should be a legend along with Pac and Biggie... he just left WAY before he could establish himself as big as them. also the feud with Dre and Death Row hurt his reputation greatly right before he died. Nonetheless he is amazing and Dre & MC Ren also add to this great cd. Do not hold out.. buy this ASAP
1	Awesome! What I love about this cd is that it has a song for just about every mood you could have. Vocals are astounding.
1	hearkening back in time What a beautiful record. The sound is so like Nick Drake and Tim and Jeff Buckley. In this age of candy coated rock and Jessica Simpson, it is such a relief to hear someone playing real, soulful music. Heart searching lyrics and beautiful melodies pared with Murdoch's subtle voice make for a haunting and beautiful album
0	Sacred Love - not sacred and I don't love it This CD fell far far below my high expectations of Sting. I found it unimaginative, sounding much like many of his earlier pieces
0	This sucks so badly... Everyone who reviewed this piece o' crap 1 star had the right idea. Now, let me drive the point home further: this song is pathetic. Billy Joe should really quit whining about how he "walks alone". After all, Green Day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame Nirvana retread. So sorry, but you don't walk alone. Maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money, I wouldn't be so opposed to this song. I've heard it said that this song has emotion. That's great...where? I know it's not in the bored way Billy Joe sings his uninspired, typical "Nobody-loves-me-even-though-I'm-also-a-rock-star-and-I-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-I'm-a-sellout-I'll-sing-about-being-a-loser" lyrics. You want emotion? Listen to Bell Bottom Blues by Derek & the Dominoes. You can tell that Eric Clapton meant every word he said. With this annoying track, all you can tell is that Green Day is a highly overrated group. If they don't stop playing this song, and fast, I don't know what I'll do.
0	This is a rather stupid album However, with all the good material in the early 90's coming out I was suckered into listening to just about every little thing. This has some rather blah songs on it, and the thing is they try to sound like everyone, but themselves. On "Dead & Bloated" they try to sound like Danzig, "Sex Type Thing" which is the best song on the whole album they sound like Alice In Chains, "Wicked Garden" and "Plush" they sound like Pearl Jam, and probably the only song that they do sound like themselves is "Creep", and with this one I have some rather bad memories of this as I remember this is one of the songs I heard all the time when I first moved down to Florida. I moved down with no job, or no car, and I was bored out of my skull, and no social life either, as no one seemed to speak to one another. As the lyrics go "Feeling Uninspired...Think I'll Start A Fire". Now that I was down in Florida full time I wasn't having a good time, and I know even now listening to this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here as if they were yesterday, and it's because at times I feel it was. Everything else on this album was too perverted, or just too long-winded.
0	Buffalo farts are probably more musical than this crap!!! I can not belive how a band as lame as this can actually get signed to a label. They make Limp Bizkit look like Led Zeppelin and I hate Limp Bizkit! I made the mistake of seeing them on Craig Kilborn the other night and believe it or not, they're even worse live than in the studio. Whne I hear something like this being actually called music, I almost want to ram ice picks into my eardrums so I won't have to hear it. If car company put out cars with the same quality standards as some of today's band's so-called music, we'd all be walking or dead. This sounds like someone yelling and screaming while pushing a lawnmower. As another reviewer said, If I could give this negative stars, I would. Avoid this at all cost!!
0	Very Poor Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album
0	I threw this cd away I did not like this cd at all. There was not even one song that I liked. However, given the positive result the cd received, it may just have been my personal taste. I also got her new cds, and did not like those eithe
0	Yet another mis-titled "Very Best Of" album Yet another attempt to re-write history and ignore the pre-Rumours era of the band. To truly be called The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac, you would have to include at least, Black Magic Woman, Oh Well, Sentimental Lady and Hypnotized. There are many more quintessential songs from the pre-Buckingham/Nicks era that should be included, but those four were in heavy FM rotation in the early 70's. They exposed the band to a huge audience, which made their commercial breakthrough in 1975 possible. To exclude them and then title this release a "best of" is criminal
1	The Vintner's Reserve Blues fron the heart of Montana. The music on this album is the vintner's reserve. Phil making music for Phil,and then sharing it with the rest of us at just the right time. This album is all Phil, all piano, and very, very good. Phil say's in the liner notes, "The Blues is simple soul music with room to get your name up". Simple for him, but this vintner's reserve is delightfully complex in flavors for the listener and subtle in style and performance from tune to tune. Soul music it is, from the heart to nourish the soul. Does he get his name up? You bet! I think this is Phil's best album yet. But then again, who can make that claim when thinking of "Cinema" or "Upright" or "A Wild Christmas" or "Live! From Montana" or "High Plains" or - all of his other timeless tunes produced over the years and on record labels past and present? If you haven't heard Philip Aaberg's music; from his hideout (Sweetgrass Music Label) near the Sweetgrass Hills in north central Montana, or if you haven't listened to him lately, then it's time to take "That Train" and "Fourteen Dollars" and head west, Blue West!
1	Pure pop rock I bought this the same day I bought Nevermind by Nirvana, and to this day this album ranks higher on my list of favorites. Maybe it's because I was just a kid when I first heard this, but it sounds so vibrant and original. Yeah, the band utilized two bassists to form their sound, which sounds gimmicky until you hear it. Basically, they had a guitarist and bassist playing the rhythm/backing parts and one bassist playing the crisp/trebly lead, which gave their sound this bright and aggressive feel. And John Penney's voice is perfect for the music; it's a little angry, a little strange, and a little hopeful. This band won't be remembered as an "important" band (like Nirvana, Pearl Jam or other bands coming up at the time), but I don't think they would particularly care to be. This is music made for the moment, and sounds pretty pure because of that
1	fabuloushardcore My brother saw Hopesfall perform one of their first shows back in 1999. He told me about how amazing they were, so I tracked down Frailty of Words and bought it online. I had all but stopped listening to hardcore before the first night I listened to the DTS release. Just like a lot of independent music, my first listen was a confused and almost disappointing one. But then I listened to it again. Now, nearly five years later, this is still my favorite cd of all time. I listen to all kinds of music too. I'm not a die hard metalcore/hardcore fan by any stretch of the imagination. These guys are blessed. Even though the original members have all gone their seperate ways for the most part, I still support and buy every album that this band comes out with. Now, let me get to No Wings To Speak Of. Just as enjoyable as their first album, and slightly more progressive. If you want to here some outstanding music, buy this EP. Trust me, for fans of hardcore, this is cutting edge pure emotion spilled out over sound waves. It will change your perception forever. Everyone rants about End Of An Era. It's absolutely 100% as good as people say, but every song on here is equally impressive. This is the fullest sounding, most emotionally driven, heart pounding, deep and intense music I've heard maybe ever. If you don't buy this cd, you are cheating yourself big time. If you like Hopesfall, I strongly recommend 7Angels 7Plagues, Misery Signals, Evergreen Terrace, Between The Buried and Me, Prayer For Cleansing. All these bands deliver much passionate hardcore, but you just can't compare them to Hopesfall. They are in a Leauge all their own. And just one more thing. What is it about North Carolina that so many of these awesome bands come from there? I dunno
0	No product yet! Unfortunatelly, until now I did not received my cd! I guess what happened? Thanks, Octavi
1	More Than Just Filler! When i bought this cd i was expecting learn to fly to be the best song and the rest to be just filler to make a full album. was i ever wrong. this is now one of my favorite cds and the best foo fighters cd to date, it is full of catchy riffs and songs that are sure to please everyone
0	Unhelpful, unsingable My church has been using this CD, and many people have been raving about it, but I feel that the reviews are unjustified. To me the CD promotes an experiential feeling of worship, where it is the music and the experience of the CD that is creating a 'feeling' of God's presence - many of the previous reviews appear to be alluding to such a thing. Because the songs are conference songs the songs stick to Adoration-type songs only (ie. songs expressing the greatness of God) - and there aren't really any songs which give their *focus* to expressing what God has done for us, or songs of confession, or songs of supplication, or songs by which we can encourage one another. The theology is very one-sided and I think for this reason very unhelpful - compare, say, to having a service where all you prayed for was to praise God for how great he is - while it's a very important thing, it's not the only thing - you are missing out on something and that's what I think this CD does. The other problem I have is that the arrangements are just too high - sure, the singers on there can sing them, but anyone with an average voice range (especially males) will have some trouble hitting some of the notes in this. "Indescribable" hits a top F - not great for congregational singing. There are some much better CDs out there with good Christian songs - I'd skip this one and try something else
1	Fantastic This CD is the best Caribbean music that money can buy in CD form. The tracts are well organized. Perfect CD for a dance party
0	bad recording I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede
0	No New Tricks I am a huge a Jurassic 5 fan, in fact they are probably the single biggest influence of why I started to like hip hop. On this album nothing catches your attention. The use the same formula that they have used in the past, but the execution of the songs sometimes seems forced. A lot of that has to do with Cut Chemist not being there. Nu-Mark is a good producer, but when he steps aside to let others produce the music you can tell the difference. "Back 4 you" and "Red Hot" are really the only two good songs on the album. There are a couple of other decent tracks but nothing that is going to get stuck in your head. Also the song with Dave Matthews Band is AWFUL, but J5 wanted to try something new, and I think that is an interesting artistic decision, it just does not work very well between these two styles. This is by far the worst J5 album, if you want classic J5 pick up Quality Control, or their EP, each of these are defining hip hop
1	best album ever of all time "A mind shattering f*cking explosion of stimulation straight to the brain."
1	I know that it sounds like hyperbole, but..... Pure Genius!!! Loveless is an absolutely essential album, and so much better than anything as of late - at least, better that anything I've heard. Imagine the most melodic guitar noise combined with exquisite vocals and intelligent lyrics, and you'll get a sense of what Loveless is all about. This is music of passion and of strange beauty - it's like trying to describe a purple rose to a blind man. If you're at all enamored by ambient music with a pronounced romantic stripe, you will LOVE this! So what are you waiting for?
1	Cool doesn't necessarily mean tepid For those of you who (unfairly) criticize this latest effort by the vastly underappreciated Teenage Fanclub as being lackluster, I wish to offer a different interpretation. Yes it is a subdued and carefully-produced effort, in keeping with their later work rather than the Bandwagonesque-era looseness and feedback-drenched Big Star rock. But it is not without soul or passion. It is simply a more relaxed record, more sculpted, more careful. The music still flows nicely, the lyrics are stronger than usual, and hooks abound. Just about every song has worthwhile aspects anda high level of attention to detail. It is obvious to me that the band put a lot into this one, from picking a new producer to writing a collection of grade-A material. Why only 4 stars then? Well, Bandwagonesque is classic, and a high, high bar was set way back when. If this came from anyone else, maybe 5 stars would be more in line. For those of you who are new to Fanclub and have stumbled onto this page by accident, let me tell you, you have to buy either the best-of collection or Bandwagonesque, or both. Really. Then you will want all the rest. I cheered when Nirvana kicked Michael Jackson off the charts in 1991 or whenever that was, but I would have cheered far more if Fanclub had subsequently booted Nirvana from those charts. It could have happened- for all the Cobain-tragedy publicity, Fanclub writes better songs. This band has been quietly and unpretetiously chugging along since 1990 at least, while nobody seems to really notice. Give them your support, they are a treasure
0	Only For Die Hards With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience
0	ouch!! hearing this hurt my feelings I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here! instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end. The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough) C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that. I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it? I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop. It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"
1	THIS is Jay... This is THE hottest Jay you'll ever hear. Ever. I got it the day it came out and I still play it like that day. Jay was hungry. If you don't have it, shame on you..get it. Enough said.
1	What a jam! While I'm normally not a huge country fan, I enjoyed this album greatly. The songs had, for the most part, a Southern-rock feel, rather than a warbly cowboy tone. The version of &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot; done as a jam session with a huge group of famous musicians, was worth the price of the tape alone! :c
0	Start With Acme! While some would call Orange and Acme "studio" albums, suggesting that they lack originality, but they have rythm. I would call myself a big JSBX fan, I play Orange and Acme constantly, however I feel that this album is a little too much free form, and free noise for the everyday listener. I would recommend that anyone interested in JSBX start with Acme and then move on to Orange to develop an appreciation for JSBX, because it is a rather acquired taste
1	KILLER Songwriting! This has got to be one of my favorite new albums out right now. I bought this a few weeks ago in NYC mostly based on the reviews comparing Feeder to Coldplay. The comparison isin't entirely accurate. But right now it seems everyone coming out who's British is being compared to Coldplay. Feeder still sounds like Feeder but they've expanded their music as well as their lyrics. One of the best tracks is track #3. It has Dougie Payne and Fran Healy of Travis doing background vocals. It's simply awesome. If you want a great record to hold you over until the new Coldplay and Travis, then get this. But please, everybody stop comparing everyone to Coldplay! Give these guys their own credit
0	SAME OLD BORING SOUND GETS OLD TWO LESBIANS sing the same old tunes of music for the entire album.....your ear get so tired after all. Typical Japanese pop sound has always been like this. There is no KICK to the tune,.....The ONLY, and THE BEST J-POP Artist really IMPRESSED me was UTADA HIKARU. She is better than MOST Western Singers. I bought this CD, listned it only once, and got rid of it. John Lennon wanna bee not so original/creative "artist".
1	Eric Manages To Get Through The Hurricane Eric's third effort is six years in the making. I noticed that the only time a artist brings us some good music to the table is when their life's in shambles. But, without pain there's no way for us humans to channel that hurt without a medium. Eric channels all that was tumultuous in his life into this wonderfully orchestrated album. Many artists tend to use one musician to lay all tracks through synthesizers,moog programs, drum machines and consoles which in a way makes the consumer lose focus on the real content of the disc. Majority of the disc is mostly based on self reflection. He's made bad choices outside of his music career, but in this disc, he shows us that he finally got it together. Be Myself is a self reflective piece on finding his true soul and sticking with it. Pretty Baby is a personal fave due to the sensual background vocals. The song also is a anthem for women to get it together and stop giving out the goods without showing some self respect for themselves. Hurricane is another reflective piece that says to come and take the pain away and let him live the life that he feels he so richly deserve. I Wanna Be Loved is a cry that says he want to be loved by that special woman. The rest of the disc is good. The cabaret infused track The Last Time totally throws off the sexy vibe, but everyone has an off quirky moment. Nevertheless, it's a solid affair with just the right amount of angst, but enough self loving prose that clearly shines through and through. Grade: A
1	raw music it takes a couple of listenings to to figure out which songs are the catchy ones and which ones are the genuinely good ones. but either way, all of the songs have this unpolished sound that makes it feel as if you're listening to her around a campfire or something, even with all the special effects. 'make it hot' 'recomendations' 'after you left' 'sun' and 'body below' are my personal favorites
1	A Whole Lotta Soul Okay, first I need to respond to a previous reviewer who gave this CD one star and stated... "She Loves You~ Twilight Singers is the kind of music that I detest. It is wordy and pretentious and sounds like the lyrics are written to annoy rather then for the audience to enjoy." "She Loves You", as clearly stated by most of the reviews here and Amazon's description of this CD, is an album of cover tunes. Meaning, all songs writen by other people. So your complaining about the verbosity of Greg Dulli in a review for this CD is...well...dumb. Upon investigation into your previous reviews I noticed you gave 5 stars to a Nick Cave CD which is surprising because Nick can be pretty verbose and often times pretentious. Bottom line, if you are here to talk trash about somebody at least listen to the CD first and be honest about it. that being said... Greg Dulli shows some pretty serious ambition with his choice of covers on "She Loves You" including the oddball "Hyperballad", the Billie Holiday classic "Strange Fruit", and Fleetwood Mac's "What Makes You think You're The One". Onlike most cover albums, Dulli doesn't just pay lip service to the originals, he applies his unique soulfull paintbrush to each and makes them his own. Most cover CDs are bad...this one isn't. It's really, really good. Buy it.
1	The illmatic of GANGSTA RECORDS The album is straight raw. Kurupt's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with Daz's Delivery. The G-Funk beats are the best they've ever sounded. As a whole, you will not skip one song at all. A+
1	Smooth Jazz at its finest I heard some of Steve Coles music one day while listening to a satellite radio station. The music I heard was unbelieveable. Smooth Jazz sax full of soul. I ordered the CD thru Amazon and have been playing it ever since. A great part of any smooth jazz collection
0	boring.... my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the "boy band" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost
0	Alright, if you absolutely HAVE to have a Garfunkel solo album... This one is for you. But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal. So guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake. Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens. in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that. Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring. I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par
0	This thug should be imprisoned Inspector: Deux Deux, we place loser gangsta rapper Juvenile under arrest. Deux-Deux: What are the charges Inspector. Inspector: First, he trashed our President and FEMA on Get Your Hustle On. Deux-Deux: That is treason. Inspector: Rodeo and the rest of this album degrades women(Rodeo), glorifies violence and praises chronic and looting! Deux-Deux: In addition, he advocates domestic violence, robbery, murder and illegal substances. Inspector: Finally, he degraded his own fans at a record launch party by a)telling a girl at his album release party that "he didn't give a f--k about her and none of ya'll b*tch*s and just want you to support my music and buy it" showing he is a greedy money hungry thug, b) this loser got into a confrontation with a female at the club exposing him for being an insensitive hypocrite and finally got into a fistfight with a white DJ. Deux-Deux: Proves he is a bonafide racist(like Kanye West) with a very nasty and abusive attitude. If you want rap, buy Run-DMC or The Fat Boys
1	Once again - don't rent, BUY! In 2005, Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter, Home Alone, etc.) adapted Jonathan Larson's beloved rock opera from stage to film and did a grand job in it. This soundtrack is a product of the music heard in the movie, and it as just as better as ever. With the usuals returning in 6 of the 8 main parts - Rapp, Pascal, Menzel, Diggs, Martin, and Heredia - there were still 2 parts left open as Daphne Rubin-Vega (Mimi) and Fredi Walker (Joanne) declined. Fortunatley, this soundtrack features two amazingly beautiful voices from their replacements who many consider are as good, and in my personal opinion are better, than the first two gals. Tracie Thoms plays Joanne with dignity and a range that could knock someone over as she brings the house down with the famous high note in "Seasons of Love." Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Alexander) has the best performance of her career as Mimi, where she can sexily serenade any listener in "Out Tonight" and reduce some to tears in "Goodbye Love." With most of the highlights sung in this film, some songs are better in this version; while songs here are in its Broadway's parallel's shadow. Then there are some songs on here that do justice to their counterpart and they are both equally good. Some improvments on this track are "Seasons of Love," "Rent," "Without You," "Santa Fe," "Tango Maureen," and "Will I?" Overall, just go get it. It's amazing. Your ears will thank you
1	Cudos to Art ! Best Effort to Date !!! First caught these three on " Live from the Bluebird Cafe ".When I bought the CD and listented to it for the first time I thought,Umm,kind of bland .After listening a few more times,all I can say is EXCELLENT !!! Excellent lyrics!! Excellent melodies!! Excellent Harmonies !! I hope these three pair up again ! Once more for the record EXCELLENT !!! Ken Shelto
0	Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles gives me a headache Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles and his "in your face" trumpet give me a headache. I like funk and groove so I should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene. For me this CD is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums. I was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when I came upon Panthalassa. Track 1 of that CD (In a silent way/Shhh/Peaceful) is nice; smoothing out and grooving out Miles while staying true: say the purists. If you love it remixed and electrofied (yes sir!) check out DJ Cam's tribute to "In a silent way".
1	A Worthwhile Purchase More than just a one hit album, "I Wish" has enough pleasing and catchy tracks to merit a purchase. The production values are high, with some great backup vocals and instrumental work. In addition to "I Wish", "This Is How It Sounds" and "Crenshaw" are solid. Really, other than the last track, "I Wish (Street Mix Version)", this is an entertaining album across the board with some interesting turns of phrase. Skee Lo's lyrics move at a fast cadence but flow with the back tracks nicely and pause from time to time to permit room for the background singers to jump in smoothly.
0	Thank You Lonestar For Making The Most Annoying Song Ever! I am baffled at how country music stations and fans of the horrible music can stand hearing Lonestar's "Mr. Mom" over and over again everyday. The song is as stupid as it is annoying, and the lyircs are extremely juvenile. Who had the horrible idea of writing a song about stay at home mothers? Lonestar, the manwomen of country. But what's worse is that Nashville and country radio declared it a hit and decided to play it 25 times per day. (And I thought that Tim McGraw's "Back When" was as bad as it could get) Let's take a look at a few of the hillariously idiotic lyrics from this song: "Football, soccer and ballet Squeeze in Scouts and PTA And there's that shopping list she left That's seven pages long How much smoke can one stove make The kids won't eat my charcoal cake It's more than any maid can take Being Mr. Mom Well Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer Crayons go up one drawer higher Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time Breakfast, six naps at nine There's bubble gum in the baby's hair Sweet potatoes(they pronounce it PER-TAT-ERS) in my lazy chair Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday Mr. Mom" I should seriously consider becoming a country artist. I can make my voice sound like a male country singer and I can write meaningless whitetrash songs, so all I have to do now is find someone to play steel guitar for me, and i'm gonna make it big as a star in Nashville and all over redneck USA. If you want to hear good country, stay with classics like Johnny Cash and Conway Twitty. Please pass on girly garbage and mindless hick mumbling

1	From a mexican Roxy Music fan Definitely Avalon in one of my top 10 albums ever; this SACD version is amazing. I have listened to the remastered album thousand of times, but believe me, listening to the SACD album is another dimension and a whole new experience. All the sonic treatments, a Roxy Music trademark are just wow!!! Best regards to the fans, Jose Curiel from Mexico Cit
1	No Slump Here Gary Allan skipped the sophomore slump with his second album, something that usually plagues new artists, but he seems comfortable on his 1998 album IT WOULD BE YOU. The album has the right balance between uptempo honky tonks and touching ballads. The album opens with the title track, one of his stronger singles. &quot;No Man In His Right Heart&quot; recounts a night where a man turns down a woman's offer, an offer no other man would refuse. &quot;Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long&quot; was co-written by Marty Stuart, its a fun honky tonk sure to please. &quot;I'll Take Today&quot; was another single from the album, a nice ballad about cherishing the time we spend in the present instead of relenting on the past. Other nice sentimental ballads include &quot;I Ain't Runnin' Yet&quot; and &quot;Baby I Will&quot;, and he does honky tonk on &quot;I've Got A Quarter In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Red Lips, Blue Eyes, Little White Lies&quot;. The album closes with &quot;Forgotten But Not Gone&quot;, a beautiful ballad, one of the best on the CD. There's also a hidden track called &quot;Judgement Day&quot; which is worth listening to. Overall this is a nice album, I think better than his first, so give it a listen
1	the awesomest album ever! Dude, nobody rocks it like the Hoff! as hard as it may be to believem his musical talents actually equal-maybe even surpass-his skills as a thespian! I was first exposed to the Hoff's amazing vocal talents when he guest starred on the classic series, KIDS, incororated. Imagine how exciting it was for a young tyke to see Knight Rider singing on saturday morning TV! y'know, Knight Rider was probably the greatest series ever about a talking car, but they really dropped the ball by not having the Hoff sing more. maybe even a duet of the Hoff and KITT of ebony and ivory. Knight Rider would've been like 37 bajillion times awesomer if it was a musical like cop rock. cop rock rules! but i'm not reviewing cop rock, I'm reviewing the Hoff's awesome retrospective album, which is a great overview of the Hoff's career, altho obviously, you're going yourself a disservice to not buy the original albums; a lot of great stuff there. But if you want an album that rocks the house, this is the one for you. Dude, I hope when they do the movie of Knight Rider it's a musical. that'd be the awesomest movie eve
1	We need MOORE like this Ian Moores selt titled debut, overall, is his best output, and judging by his new found musical style, will remain so. I could'nt honestly understand all the hoo-haa about the SRV guitar similarities. When we are talking about SRV Clones, we are talking about Sunset Heights,Indigenous,Scarlet Runner etc. On this debut, there is not one bit of evidence about ripping off SRV. None of the songs are straight out Blues Songs. They are in fact a mixture of Rock and Soul. Ian has now gone on the trek of leaving behind his guitar hero status and concetrating on his fine song-writing talent and his gifted soulful voice. No weak tracks on this CD at all which cannot be said about any other Ian Moore CD. Ian's Vocalist heroes all stem round the golden era of RnB with Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye etc to the fore. You can really feel his emotions when he sings, and this can't really be said about SRV in the same way. I saw Ian at the small prestigeous London club "The Borderline" on JULY 4 1994, and it still rates as one of the best concerts I have seen in my entire life. Although I was a little bit disappointed that he didnt include my personal fave on the CD (i.e. Revelation), as it was only a 60 min support slot to Omar and the Howlers. He in fact included 2 or 3 cover versions including "Me and my guitar" and "Spanish Castle Magic". Ian would later appear at Wembley Arena in support to ZZ Top (Capacity approx. 15000), but the only thing Ian had in comparison to La Trio Grande is that they both hail from Texas. A better support slot would have been to Bryan Adams as an example. Ian later went on to write 2 more albums with the Original band (Modern day Folklore AND And all the Colors), and from those albums came 4 amazing tracks (Today,Coming around, Time of dying and Fickle). He would also release a Minil Live Album (Live in Austin) with the Original LIne-up as well which includes 2 or 3 songs from the debut as well as "Me and my guitar". I heard a rumour that Ian never made it because he was "Too Hollywood" with his pretty boy looks etc. I met Ian at the Borderline gig, and he was vey Humble, calm and polite with no sign of ego or arrogance. I really do hope we get the chance again to hear Ian play some REAL Blues music, and let the world know what really could have been. Either way, I wish him all the best
1	Great blues rock, good voice I had this album on my shelf for years (along with Modernday Folklore) and I just broke them out again; I forgot how good they are. I can't stop playing them right now. He really knows how to break it up by picking up the pace and slowing it down. I bought if for "Blue Sky" which was played on the radio at the time but the others are great, too. "Harlem" is your socially conscious rock tune, but one great piece of music
0	HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT I'm a really big Christina fan. Hands down, she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there. This album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics. It would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role. Although there are a couple of good tracks, the rest are filler. I was really disappointed with the outcome of this album.
0	Who Mike Jones? Who Cares? Mike Jones isn't anything different. Still Tippin is talking about what every other rapper has already covered. Who cares if your "tippin" on 4 4s? All the other songs are just basic rap songs with no real meaning. Also, how many times does this guy need to say his name or give out his phone number?
0	A tribute that doesn't deliver I was SO MOVED when I first watched Hedwig that I bought the DVD, Soundtrack and Broadway Soundtrack. What a masterful bit of writing and performance; just astonishing. After I listened to this tribute, I just couldn't write a positive review. The magic and emotion is not there. The feeling is gone. I know this review is short, but not much really needs to be said other than: Save your money and buy the original
0	dizzy up I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene. I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store. Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days. Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now. It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco. It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this.
0	Horrible!!!! George Benson can be one of the best guitar players, make some of the best recordings, and sound so good, if he wanted to. If you think George Benson is any kind of jazz, you'd be right. He even started out playing straight ahead jazz. But by no means, is this a jazz album. Many of the songs on here are horrible R&B with vocals, by Benson. That's ok if that's what you like, but I curtainly dont. We already got enough R&B vocalists. Benson is a talented man! Why does he have to lower himself to play this garbage. The only good song on this CD is Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise; and that's questionable. No, George Benson did not pull it off with his latest effort. Benson, you gotta play some jazz. Any thing else, but this. Lay off the R&B vocals and show the world what a talented jazz guitarist you are
1	A harmonic sound all their own 'The Mamas and the Papas' had a sound all their own, a unique kind of Southern California blend, a harmony of at times melancholy beauty. They had one great singer, Mama Cass, whose 'Dream a Little Dream of me' is perhaps the closest thing they ever produced to a really great 'solo'. Their signature song and one of the unforgettable sixties song is 'California Dreaming'. It seemed to express a certain haunting longing , the longing for a place which then represented to many Americans, California, the golden land of escape and new home. John Phillips who like Mama Cass is no longer with us was the arranger, director who really made the 'Mamas and Papas' into such a great group. It is strange even then their sound evoked a certain feeling of 'nostalgia' but four decades later the jump of initial joy hearing them brings is truly complemented by the sense of a world long gone.
0	Fits the movie... High marks for accompanying the nature of the film well (pure action), but I miss the subtlety of the previous soundtracks..
1	WE CAN DREAM, CAN'T WE? {*Yeah, sure.*} Richard Carpenter has expressed a slight dissatisfaction in HORIZON, and although I am a HUGE fan of The Carpenters {*He exaggerates; don't listen to him. He weighs about 165.*} I fear I must concur with Richard's assessment. This collection is akin to finding a few purebred Golden Retrievers running with a pack of common dogs. {*A really bad analogy, Stephen! Remember, man, this is the world's greatest singer you're talking about here.*} The album opens and closes with the very brief, atmospheric mood pieces, AURORA and EVENTIDE - so good you're actually left disappointed that they weren't expanded. In between is the memorable, but widely available hit, ONLY YESTERDAY, and the haunting SOLITAIRE. Unquestionably, the big knockout track here is the dreamy, I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I, and this is really saying something when you consider that this collection also includes Karen's heartfelt reading of Frey & Henley's movingly plaintive and lyrically brilliant, DESPERADO - a song that would be the major highlight on any number of other albums! Richard once lamented that had he only known how little time he and his sister would have together, they wouldn't have wasted any of it recording songs like Beechwood 4-5789. Although it went to Number 1 on the U.S. charts, and was a runaway monster in Japan {*You mean like Godzilla?*}, I have to believe that Richard would have included PLEASE MR. POSTMAN in this lamentable category. It's just pure radio fluff; about as satisfying as a Popsicle! For me, the other three cuts (#7, 8 & 9) are nearly equally forgettable. Oh, but did I mention, I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I? {*Forgive him, folks. He's starting to get long in the tooth, and one's memory is always the first thing to go!*} It's bittersweet. Sweet in that Karen's exquisite, intimate voice and delicious delivery are perfectly framed by the crystalline, rock candy piano at the forefront and by the warm, melty, white chocolate strings in the background! {*Stephen, you hungry maybe?*} It's just GORGEOUS! A light wisp of smoke, tenderly wrapped in gauze and gently placed in a bed of softly folded lace. And it's bitter in that this is the only taste of it that we are ever going to get. Just a glimpse of an unrealized potential. What a treasure we would have possessed if The Carpenters had recorded an entire album of time-tested standards with similar stylistically luscious arrangements. It could have been called CLASSIC KAREN and included songs such as, Stardust; You Belong To Me; Misty; September Song; and Smokin' In The Boy's Room. {*SMOKIN' IN THE BOY'S ROOM?!!*} No, I meant, Smoke On The Water. {*SAY WHAT?!*} Smoke Gets In Your Eyes? {*Yeah, well that's a little more like it. Man, they'll let just about anybody post reviews on Amazon, won't they?*} But I suppose it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. {*Good line, Stephen, but it sounds familiar.*} Alas, we're never going to get CLASSIC KAREN, but still we can listen to this one shimmering moment over and over, and we can dream, can't we? {*Yeah, I know he's kind of sappy, but you get used to him.*} In addition to the music, there are two REALLY NICE photos of Karen on the front and back cover {*Alright, Stephen, take it easy!*} and musically, the mountaintops are so majestic on this slightly uneven recording that they cast their shadows down into the valleys and render them passable. If you are new to The Carpenters, you could do worse than this collection, and if you are already a fan, then purchasing this compact disc should be on your immediate HORIZON. {*Ok, you done now? Let's log off, get out of these pajamas, and go get something to eat already. Man, I'm starving!*}
0	D-e-l I remember around 1991, NBA Inside Stuff did a feature on B.J. Armstrong (my favorite player) of the Chicago Bulls. B.J. said that his favorite song was "Mr. Dobalina". I remember thinking, well, if B.J. Armstrong likes this guy named Del tha Funkee Homosapien, then he must be good. And yes, Del's first album "I Wish My Brother George Was Here" is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic. So I recommend that album over this one (it's cheap too). Del was at his creative peak with that first album; it featured great production from Ice Cube (back when Ice Cube made good albums instead of movies). Since then, his career's been a mixed bag. His CD's are very inconsistent. A Best Of CD is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd's. But I think you'd also be better off buying "Deltron 3030" and "I Wish My Brother George..." instead
0	Steady At [not Fumbling Towards] Mediocrity Too boring to ever really loathe, McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years, but the compendium is always the same - dull songs, listless vocals, uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement. Nothing here as breathtaking as `Ben's Song' or `Possession' or `Do What You Have To Do', but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded `Angel' and `Into The Fire' and `Solace' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon. She might or might not be a hack, but if she is, she's a fancy hack. My grade: C
1	A dark ride Rosanne Cash's meditation of the loss of life and love (her father, Johnny; her stepmother, June Carter Cash; and her mother, Vivian Cash Distin) is her darkest album since the divorce chronicle of "Interiors." She calls into question both God and herself on such songs as "House on the Lake" and the title track. Like some of Emmylou Harris' best work (like the recent "Red Dirt Girl"), Rosanne has moved to the far fringe of country and given her music an both a dose of intelligence atmospheric edge. You won't find any lighthearted 'redneck girl' stompers here. In fact, "Radio Operator" is probably the closest thing to a generic country song on "Black Cadillac." This is a good thing. Cash refuses to bend to anyone's rules (much like she has on some of her other great records and "Rules Of Travel). She delivers both her grief and her resolve simply and elegantly on "Dreams are Not My Home" and gives a reality check face slap to bickering lawyers on "Like Fugitives" and a reaffirmation of life/faith on "God Is In The Roses." To say that "Black Cadillac" is merely a tribute to her lost family members is selling the CD short. Rosanne is, like the Dixie Chicks, Slaid Cleaves, Emmylou Harris or even her father's "American Music" series, making country music for thoughtful adults
1	Another Great from the Great Todd Rundgren Great remake of the Cars great toons and only Todd could do it!!! the vocals and the mixes are fantastic!!
0	Remakes - NOT ORIGINAL recordings If you're looking for the sound of the original recordings, look to a different CD.
0	Fluffy Pretentiousness HelloGoodbye has a sound that's really in vogue right now. The problem is they forgot that no amount of 'being hip' can replace 'tired cliche writing'. In many regards - most of the songs on the album could have been sung by a female pop group in the 90s and it would have sounded perfectly in place (especially Touchdown Turnaround (Don't Give Up On Me) which is borderline annoying). The band also needs to adopt a more singular sound. The point is an album is supposed to be cohesive, and the swtich from more traditional instrumentations to songs and a purely synth base instrumentation makes the alubm sound like two bands fighting for the attention of the listeners. In many ways, it's almost as if the band wanted to be both phases of the band Depeche Mode at once. In case you don't listen to Depeche Mode, their early releases were very light and poppy and purely synth base, such as the song "Just Can't Get Enough." However, at some point (I usually point it around the single Blasphemous Rumours), the band became much more darker and eventually became a more traditional rock band in the sense that their albums were dominated by guitars. Then they went back to synths while keeping the darker sound. The problem is that the band accomplishes neither very well, and even if they did, the two sounds don't together at once. Then comes the lyrics. Their songwriter employs cliches and shows that he understands the basics of how to rhyme. For instance, "Everywhere and everytime/ I am yours and you are mine" from Touchdown Turnaround. The other lyrics are just as simplistic - just like "I like where we are/ when we drive in your car" from Here (In Your Arms). The author doesn't know how to express love in a manner that doesn't come off as very niave and simplistic, as if stating the obvious makes for great song lyrics. They are not terrible. They just simply are nothing special. It just sounds as if they are taking the hip sound and forgetting what made that sound was hip was quality song writing. And they just don't bring that to the table. The only thing they bring to the table are two guilty pleasures... sadly Touchdown Turnaround and Here. If the songwriter can get a bit deeper with his lyrics and the band chooses a sound they could put out a nice piece of pop fluff. As it stands, this album is nothing but fluffy pretentiousness. Remember rule #1 of music - it should never sound like you are trying. It should just sound natural. And it sounds like these guys tried hard
1	His Best! This is by far his best album. He goes for meaningful yet witty lyrics and the music is a mix of old and new. I can't stop listening to this one!! My favorites are "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room" and "I Don't Trust Myself". This young man has had a lot more life experience than his age would suggest. We need him around for a long time!!
0	Not a good purchase I found this an odd CD. It had Italian operatic type songs and then pop songs. It made my wonder who Josh Grobin thinks he is
0	I think that the song lips of an angel should be renamed "I'm just not that into you or my girlfriend either" Extreme behaviour? I think not. Perhaps extremely bad lyrics. Was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow? I just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel? Could it get any sicker? I think the song should be retitled Welcome to Hell
0	Give this a wide berth What a hateful album this is. Each song, a classic in it's own right, eviscerated by this glorified club singer. The song "It was a very good year" illustrates my point, you hear Williams's voice, and it's dire, but then to have Sinatra sing on the same song so you can compare the two was folly indeed. I would be surprised if this sells even one copy, especially since the originals can be purchased for far less than this. Which fool would therefore choose the talentless imitator over the original? Do yourself a favour and buy the originals if you like these songs, if you buy this people will point at you in the street and laugh
1	very good I don't know much about Danielle's genre of music but I thought this was a very good album and she sounds as good as any other female pop star out there. Why she hasn't had the break-through I have no idea. The lyrics are interesting and she sings with a great deal of power. Her cover of "Gimme Some Sign" was excellent.
0	Big Black did a good cover once of Cheap Trick's 'He's a ... Whore." Cheap Trick fans should check it out
1	A Different Kind of Cold I have been a long time fan of Cold. The newer more mellow Cold is definately the best sound they have produced yet. The third album "Year of the Spider" is not too far behind and that is for sure, but the old cold was not as emotional and vocally talented as the the new Cold. Cold has lost some talent intramentally, yet I don't see this as a bad thing. Scooter Ward is so talented vocally there is no need for instruments to attempt to drown him out. Give ward the stage! This fresh sound from cold is certainly implemented in the title track, as it is only ward and his beloved piano for the most part of the song. The intruments are there but there is certainly no need. The song writing ability of Ward can not be matched by anyone in the rock genre. This is a kind of parent-friendly grunge-flavored soft rock that 1-ups every kind of alternative rock out there which seems to be all screams and F-bombs nowadays. If you like rock this is the album for you. If it doesn't hit the spot the first time try round two and you will agree
0	Amateurish, style over substance This pianist is painful to watch and boring to hear. We can only hope he is not the idol of a new generation of classical music listeners. It would be a bad omen for the future ...
1	Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No. 2; Paganini Rhapsody The best interpretation of this piano concerto I have ever heard. Smooth, silky and precise, this is super pianomanship
0	Un-unique New York I came across LEVY's profile on a popular personals/music website, and I found nothing but good reviews and great comments, so I decided to spend my extra birthday money on their album. As I sat and listened to it, I kept wondering if I accidentally received the wrong CD; everything I heard sounded like Coldplay. Now, I don't have anything against cover bands, but when you copy someone else's music, you should at least give them proper respect and acknowledge that you've made their music into your own. On this album, LEVY mimicked much of the trademark guitar sound and texture of Coldplay. Much of their personally filtered reviews taunt their work as completely original, and at times, they even sound as if LEVY might be musically revolutionary or something. In regards to the actual musical content of the album, I find it lukewarm, stale and, well, plain boring. Steer clear of this one if you're looking for something new and different. After seeing several reviews stating this Kenny Anderson guy wrote my review, I figured I should add a realname tag to show that more than just Kenny Anderson thinks Levy sucks
0	They Write Theme Songs Good, Unfortunately, That Doesn't Count For Anything All this is iis a bunch of 1:00 long songs that are all crap. They should have put This Might Be A Wiki or at least Boss of Me on here. But, unfortunately, it's a FLOP! FLOP! FLOP! Useless noise! LOCAL CRAZY MONKE
1	"Ya ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?" Just to make things clear, I've never owned any Prince albums, and therefore can't consider myself a fan. Most people seem to judge these songs by comparison to his other work, but I'm speaking from a completely neutral point of view when I say: This album is great! I remember I bought this back in the early 90s thinking it was Danny Elfman's score to the film, and returned it when I realized it was actually a soundtrack by Prince. So, over a decade later, when I read that Jack Nicholson himself supported the use of Prince's talent for some of the movie's music, I figured why not give it a shot? I figured right! All nine tracks have their own style and place, but the best ones are full of dance-able funk and hook, like "The Future", "Electric Chair", "Partyman", "Trust", and "Batdance" (you gotta dig that breakdown). It has that feel-good electronic goove that's the epitome of 80's pop music. And as a nice little touch, there are several songs that use audio clips from the film (namely Nicholson's Napier/Joker character) that really keep the Bat-atmosphere alive. I've long been a fan of Gotham's characters as well as Jack Nicholson, and now, through this, I think Prince may hold a spot on my list. Basically said, "Batman" The Soundtrack is a must for anyone who loved the movie
0	Boo.... hiss! This is good hip-hop music, but that's ALL it is. The infectious tango track from the movie, (which was even used again for the title page on DVD), is conspicuously NOT there, nor any waltz, rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN SCHOOL KIDS WHO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING! Sure, the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film, but that was only about half the music in the film. And in this case, the absence of ballroom dancing tracks, for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable. There should be a disclaimer on the cover of this CD to warn away anyone looking for the great, danceable tango, waltz, etc. tracks that were in the film.
0	Rod is an entertainer now... ...not a musician. What I see in the negative reviews is a desire for Rod the Musician to return to old form. What I detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of Rod as an entertainer. Some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained. Rod converted long ago from musician to Vegas entertainer. If you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians, sample Robert Plant's or Neil Young's latest. Don't waste your time on Rod or this kitsch
0	Avoid Aside from the song, "Brother", this CD is not worth your money. I'm not attacking these guys on a personal level, but anyone that appreciates music will see this CD has no flow. It sounds as if a few guys got together and created some decent riffs and then hastily hired a singer to apply lyrics so they could pump the thing out. The result is just as I said; a few good bass and guitar riffs and lyrics with religious overtones and no feel to the whole thing. There is nothing clever or conceptual about their music. Nothing lasting or memorable. Nothing worth your hard earned $. If this band has as much talent as the reviews that I read here all seem to say, where is the 2nd release? There won't be one
1	Great as usual While stadium-rock dinosaurs like the Rolling Stones and U2 have been embarassing themselves putting out crappy albums and playing Super Bowl halftime for years, Sonic Youth have continued to put out unpredictable, diverse, and all-around excellent abums under the radar. Rather Ripped continues the band's recent resurgence, as it contains all of the shimmering, mature (I hate that word most of the time, but it really does fit here) beauty that marked Murray Street and Sonic Nurse, while containing enough departures to prove the band's well of ideas is far from dry. Thurston, Lee and Co. have obviously put a lot of effort into ensuring that the band's sound doesn't become calcified, but at the same time this is still unmistakably a Sonic Youth album, as Rather Ripped doesn't do any cribbing from the countless imitators that have emerged in the wake of the early-'90's alternative boom. The twin-guitar interplay between Lee and Thurston is as dense and intricate as ever, but as on the previous Murray Street and Sonic Nurse, it's focused less on rearranging your brains Daydream Nation-style than on creating warm, inviting tones that mix with Steve Shelley's increasingly nuanced and jazzy drumming to create some of the band's most hypnotic soundscapes yet even as their overall sound becomes more streamlined and accessible (that's not to say there isn't still the occasional freakout to be found; witness the classic instrumental break on the opening Reena). The band certainly hasn't stopped rocking, but they've somehow managed to do it in a consistently intelligent and sophisticated way even as their catalog has expanded to around the 15-album mark. Really, that's the neatest trick of all in the Youth's 21st-century renaissance-the songs on Rather Ripped are easily among their most user-friendly, but there's more than enough attention to detail, and enough individual touches to each track, to keep their more discriminating fans coming back for more. After the merely good Reena, Rather Ripped really takes off, as the next three songs are all among the Youth's best in recent memory, and different enough from each other to show a different facet of their sound at each turn. The catchy, poppish Incinerate gives way to the eerily minimal, almost pastoral Do You Believe in Rapture? before the album skids into more aggressive territory with the thudding backbeats and sneering, vitriolic vocals of Sleeping Around. Between them, these three songs encompass much of what has kept Sonic Youth relevant well into their third decade of existence, as they all strike a balance between their old status as noise-rock pioneers and their new position as seasoned elder statesman at a time when virtually all of their contemporaries have long since either faded out or imploded. Thurston's vocals have become more self-assured and evocative than ever-even in his quieter moments, there's a level of confidence and depth that wasn't there in the band's early days. Similarly, Kim's vocals have evolved into a smoky, mid-ranged tone that serves her much better than the high-pitched annoyances she used in the Daydream Nation-Goo-Dirty era. Lee's obligatory contribution isn't wasted either, as his dark, confrontational Rats is another highlight. The hard-driving Pink Steam goes for five mintues before the first words come out of Thurston's mouth, but vocals or no vocals, the song's complex arrangements and dense riffage speak volumes on their own. Or closes the album on a nicely quiet, contemplative note, with Thurston intoning his lyrics in a near-whisper, although it's not without its share of dissonance in the background. While you could pretty much insert this quote into a review of the band's last two albums (in fact, I might have), Rather Ripped once again shows Sonic Youth expanding their sound into more accessible territory without abandoning the creative drive that made them so compelling in the first place. Definitely a worthy pickup, and I for one can't wait to see what they come out with next. On another note, I saw these guys live last night in Boston, and many of the songs on this album come across even better in a concert setting, so if can catch them, do it. Granted, they did make a reference to last night's show being the conclusion of their tour, so it may be a little late. But whatever, they're still worth seeing
0	Not as good as his 3 previous salsa albums *** stars - can't change the above! Valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of Amar sin Mentiras. And it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought. While it is a pretty decent salsa album (albeit brief), it is simply not in the class of his other three salsa CD's, Todo a su Tiempo, Contra la Corriente, and especially, Libre. The arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique as were the older ones.
1	Don't get this if you don't like true Punk . . . If you don't like Punk, not the Green Day junk, true anti-social punk music that kicks you in the face, don't get this album. If you like music that grates on you, pisses you off, and is generally anti-social get this album. It is a reincarnation of all that is Fing great with punk, grating vocals and thrash. Not for the wanna be crowd

0	Dylan's Most Overrated Album I just don't get why people like this album. It stinks. "Sara" is Dylan at his whiny worst. "Mozambique" was the result of a drunken bet about how many words Dylan could rhyme with Mozambique. And the worst thing of all on the album is Rivera's screeching violin on every track. About her: Dylan was riding in a limo and saw her walking on the street with a violin case. He liked the way she walked so he picked her up and promised to allow her to play on his album. And so it goes. "Bringin' it all Back Home" this ain't. I am a huge Dylan fan and have most of is catalogue, but this is the one album of his that I just can't stand. Not one song works. If you are new to Dylan , get "Bringin it all Back Home", "Highway 61", "Blonde on Blonde", and "Blood on the Tracks". If you already have those, there are about 20 more to get before you bother with this one. Oh, and one more thing: Reuben Carter was guilty
1	SHOOK ONES PT II That song alone made this group hard and it is a classic song. I never bought their debut album because they looked too young and too inexperienced but this album changed all that with this song and couple others on here and put them on the map. If you are a true rap fan then this should be in your collection right now.
0	It doesn't have the total domination song but... Hey everyone that wants the total domination song u can get it on a different cd. and the real name of the song get ready for this and u get the cd of this site and the cd is called jock jams 1. ur welcome all of u that wanted this song cauise I have been lokking fior at leasst 3 years lkkking for this song and I finally found it and it's only 12.99. excellent or what
1	A Timeless Classic "Step In The Arena" did feel a lot like an debut album than a sophmore release, not taking anything away from "No More Mr. Nice Guy" but that album was more like a demo record. Whereas "Step In The Arena" was a peek into the future as to what was to come later for GangStarr. Guru's veteran type flow/hungry new coming MC intensity and Premier's bass heavy jazzed out beats made this album a timeless classic which could go toe-to-toe with the new material being release today. Any true hiphop head needs to have this CD in their collection.
0	Cash In Now, Honey! A cynical grab for more moolah. "Wow! These guys are real rebels with something real to say!" Sorry, this re-recording exposes them as the poseurs they apparently always were. Hey guys, how about writing some NEW music? Oh, that's right. Whatever spark you had went out decades ago. I'm sure I would still have a good time seeing them live, but sadly, they have turned into a nostalgia act. Even the cover is a tired, boring re-hash. This GIFT should be returned
1	It's a Roller-Coaster Ride That Never Stops Whenever I listen to this album I think I'm at an amusement park and I'm going on these fun rides. The orchestrations for La Cage aux Folles are excellent and so is the sound quality. I will never stop listening to this musical until I am at old age. Everybody who is anybody should have this musical because this musical has extreme spirit that never halts until perhaps the 2 ballads here in this show. I could be riding on a motorcycle when listening to all these upbeat numbers and I'd stop at a red light during the ballads. Man, this show is even better than Hello, Dolly and/or Mame only because they don't have as extreme an excitement as La Cage aux Folles. In my opinion, this musical is like no other Jerry Herman musical, a musical with music to be played at amusement parks (especially the rollercoasters)
0	Micheal Sullevan knows nothing about punk This joker called blink-182 punk!!!!!!!! Give me a break, This is emo, And not punk. There are a few bands on here i like. But the rest is crap
0	Nobody cares what school Michael Sullivan or "Tom" went to First off, the Atticus collections never feature great music; with the exception of the occasional song. Hate to break everyone's hearts. This one in particular is chock fulla corny, sappy, pop-punk goodness. Not that it's not fun to listen to, but (and like I said, with certain exceptions) there's nothing on here that you couldn't see on MTV and make a mixtape out of. Taking 15 bands, half of them sub-par, and putting together a collection of the only single (if you can call it that) off their latest lame album doesn't make a quality recording. If you're looking for something a bit more edgy, try picking up the complilations put together by the indie labels themselves of the best songs from their artists. Because this is usually where you're going to find stand-out tracks that you can really appreciate for the fact that you like it, not because blink-182 says they're cool (and no disrespect because I love blink too). That's just my advice. To everyone who does really enjoy the music on here that's cool too. I'd still rather hear Dragging The Lake blaring out of someones car than the newest DJ Kay Slay or Funkmaster Flex mixtape that's for sure, or should I say, fo sho. And to the previous reviewer who commented that the worst track on the album is Saosin's Bury Your Head; if you had any musical taste beyond Blink or MXPX because they're "frickin awesome" you'd know that Anthony Green is one of the most respected vocalists in the independant scene. Saosin's Translating The Name EP featuring Green on vocals is held by many as one of the best independant debut EPs of all time. If you want further proof, download the acoustic version of Seven Years and tell me if you can think of another emo-vocalist with anywhere near the same range. It's always better to open your ears before you open your mouth.
1	Grey Gardens Glistens Grey Gardens is well-written show, with a fine score. This album contains brilliant comic performances, as well as pathos. Reminds us that the Bouviers and the Kennedys were quirky families, just like all of our own. The Revolutionary Costume for the Day number at the top of Act II is utterly devestating, rendered by the brilliant Christine Ebersole, who plays Mother in Act 1, and her own Daughter in Act II
1	A Must Have For any Johnny Cash Fan One of the greatest albums ever released.Johnny sings from his heart & the Man in Black will live on forever. Pet
1	Not my favorite but still 5 stars. Lets face it its a two major hit album. Still that plus the big pay off experimentation are worth 5 stars against anyone you can think of.
0	Doesn't quite hit the mark I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much. I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc. Why would you disable that option? I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD. The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content
0	Not worth it Jessica Simpson is through being famous for her "talent" and is now known primarily for her sex appeal and stupidity. When she started out years ago in the music business, she had a pretty good singing voice. Now she's filled up her CD's with bubble-gum lyrics and a breathy, whispery, off-key voice. Where other artists have grown in their musical talent, Jessica appears to have stayed the same, and maybe even gone downhill. I don't feel that this CD is worth the price.
0	so very disappointing I'm a loyal Orton fan; Trailer Park is her best, and I'm a fan the "other side of daybreak". This cd is a complete disappointment. It is trite, boring, and political in a very dull and usual way; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness, charm, and melancholy that so characterize most of Orton's work. I get the distinct feeling that she didn't have this cd in her, but just put it out there because there were so many (ourselves) who were waiting. Orton's merit is that her songs come from her heart; these songs come from her head. These songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop, and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden. We wish Beth the best; but we also wish she would give us her best; and if she can't do that, well, we'll be content with her 'classics'
0	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA This looks so hilarious! How did you lose Jessica Simpson you dolt?! What a loser, now he'll be relegated to the back of page six and then gone forever, way to use 'em and lose 'em Simpson.
0	Sloppy Sloppy, trite lyrics, way too much quitar. These guys don't know what their doing. Massively over-rated. Belle and Sebastian are 100 times better than this crap band
1	Great CD. I am loving this one! Most every song is a "keeper" and they all make me want to dance.
1	The Greatest Prince Album The album "Sign `o' the Times" by Prince is one of my ALL-TIME favorites. Not many people I encounter know anything about this CD and that is beyond shameful because they are missing out on one of the trippiest and most joyful musical experiences known to mankind. HOW'S THAT FOR HYPERBOLE? Let's break it down.... 01) SIGN `O' THE TIMES: This is a fantastic slow and spooky funk tune that waxes philosophical about such society ills as aids, gang violence, drugs, hurricanes, murders, poverty, war and even space shuttle explosions. Much like John Lennon's song "Imagine", this tune is just as relevant in 2006 as it was when originally released. 02) PLAY IN THE SUNSHINE: This is one of my fave Prince tunes ever. Musically, it sounds like a psychedelic gospel rave up and lyrically, it is all about trippin' on a natural high. FANTASTIC TRACK! 03) HOUSEQUAKE: Prince brings the fun big time with this tune. A mixture of James Brown, hip-hop and euro-dance-pop; HOUSEQUAKE is like nothing you've ever heard...and who else but Prince in his prime would toss out a "Green Eggs and Ham" reference in the middle of a mad-funky throw down? 04) THE BALLAD OF DOROTHY PARKER: This is a mellow funk groove that plays like a collaboration between Sly Stone and Joni Mitchell. I kid you not! 05) IT: After four fantastic tunes in a row, you'll be thinking "Man, this album is pure genius" but then comes this song. The only bleak spot on an otherwise exceptional album. "IT" is a meandering bit of danceable filler. Prince released a single b-side from this same period called "Shockadelica" that would have been much better in this position on the album. 06) STARFISH and COFFEE: This song begins with the sound of an alarm bell and proceeds to take us on a journey into the bizarre magic of childhood. Another one of my faves for it's sheer uniqueness. 07) SLOW LOVE: This is a sensual jazzy love ballad that features some magnificent trumpet solos. 08) HOT THING: What would a 1980's Prince album be without some blatant sexual innuendo? Well here it is furious and funky. The best part of this song is the saxophone work of Eric Leeds. 09) FOREVER IN MY LIFE: This is a slow romantic marriage proposal sung acapella with only the driving beat of a drum machine for accompaniment. Yet another one-of-a-kind song. 10) U GOT THE LOOK: A funk-rock masterpiece with some latin percussion driving the mix. This song is the "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" of dance music. 11) IF I WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND: On this song, Prince writes in a conversational style as if telling his girlfriend that he wants a closeness with her that she usually reserves for her best girlfriend. One of the most interesting and daring lyrics you're likely to ever come across. 12) STRANGE RELATIONSHIP: Another out-of-the-ordinary lyric about a couple with a love / hate relationship that neither one can put an end to. Features the great chorus..."Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy / More than that, I hate to see you sad / Honey if you left me I just might do something rash / What's this strange relationship?" 13) I COULD NEVER TAKE THE PLACE OF YOUR MAN: This is guitar pop at it's best with a great lyric about actually turning down a woman's sexual advances. Features a terrific guitar solo / break down midway through the song. 14) THE CROSS: This is a song about overcoming the adversity in life through spiritual faith in but even if you're an atheist, you won't be able to deny the rhythmic and melodic power of this tune. It starts off slow, quiet and acoustic then builds to an all out rockin' climax. 15) IT'S GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT: This is a 9 minute jam-out track that was recorded live with Prince's unbelievable 80's band The Revolution...featuring Shelia E. on the drums. A truly remarkable funk experience that showcases Shelia E. rapping Edward Lear's classic poem "The Table and the Chair" in the middle of all the musical mayhem. Another one of my faver most faves! 16) ADORE: This amazing album comes to a end with this gorgeous classic-style r&b ballad. WHAT A TRIP! If you've never heard this album, I strongly suggest that you check it out immediately and give your ears a sonic treat. Just skip song number 5
0	Brainwashed Anthem for the Neo-Conservatives Wow. Where do I even begin? It is sad to think that so many Americans are as misinformed about Iraq and the war on terror as this Darryl Worley is. First off, I don't know anyone who is saying "you shouldn't worry about Bin Laden." If anything people against the war in Iraq wanted our government to spend more time and efforts tracking down al-Qaeda's leader. The fact that Bush Jr. will not make the hunt for Bin Laden his #1 priority is one of the many reasons why millions of Americans voted for Kerry. They want a leader who will stand up and protect us from the mastermind who attacked us and not send us on a wild goose chase like what Bush Jr. has unfortunatly done. Think for once Darryl! Next, if you are going to write a song about invading Iraq at least make references to it. Also, now that the war in Iraq and our president's approval ratings are so low. I doubt Darryl Worley would ever make a sequel song about staying the course in Iraq. He and his managers are probably thinking about the next tragedy to cash in on. Hmmmm maybe he will $ing about Hurricane Katrina next... We have spent so-far 500 billon dollars and more than that worth in human life lost in Iraq, all that in a war that "ended" according to our president on May 1, 2003. Perhaps, outsourcing jobs to other countries should be extended to crappy songwriters too.
0	No seriously. People actually buy this? People buy fast food, they know its bad for them. People pay the Geek Squad 229 to do 5 minutes of work. People ALSO pay 10 bucks for words & techno beats called "pop music". Amazing, if you had this much money: go get a gym membership. Pay off your cars. Donate it to children's hospital. Why support some teen that in 2 years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion
0	You See Me CRYIN'... Tho' Aerosmith's first greatest hits package wasn't perfect (lacking Train Kept a Rollin' and featuring edited AM single versions of a couple big hits), it still stands hair and shoulders above this "Second Coming of Aerosmith" mix. Where Dream On was a definitive power ballad of its era, Big Ones is overstuffed with the lame metal mellow-dies (Cryin', Amazing, Crazy) that have become the bad boys' schlock in trade. I reckon chart peak/career low I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing will have to wait for Hits 3. Even the so called rockers (the dumb and dumber Dude Looks Like a Lady and Love in an Elevator) can't hold a Bic lighter to fine, funky seventies fare Walk This Way and Same Old Song and Dance, and I refuse to dignify anything from Get a Grip with an insult. it only gets worse, and sadder, after THAT album, folks. What's the point of being the longest lived rock band after Mick and Keith if you're not even gonna ROCK anymore??? (Sigh)...call me "Jaded". RATING: TWO LIPS
1	Off to a good start I am a Destiny's Child fan but I picked up this CD last because I didn't think its wasn't going to be that good. The vocals are awesome, suprising its not just Beyonce singing with background singers. Beyonce's voice wasn't stellar here whcih gives the Cd a different sound. Pick it up if you are a DC fan if not you'll probably still like it. Favs are Second Nature, With me pt1, both No, No, No's and Show me the wa
1	Lived up to my expectations! I recently saw We Are Scientists open for the Arctic Monkeys at the Granada in Dallas and my, were they good! Usually, opening acts are disregarded, and We Are Scientists weren't taken with interest at first, but after just a song, everyone was singing and dancing. They are friendly guys (I met Keith after the show with my friends) with humorous personalities and clever bander and their lyrics, while simple at times, still make an impact amongst catchy and well-executed instrumentation.
1	Is There A Law That Says You Can't Like Both Versions? Apparently, there's an unwritten law that says you can't possibly like both versions of Primal Scream? Well, I beg to differ! I happen to dig both the groundbreaking psychedelic/electronica sounds of the "Screamadelica" and "Vanishing Point" discs as well as this far from innovative but still hugely enjoyable slice of retro-rock. Fans of 70s-style hard rock with generous doses of funk, soul and blues will like this CD alot. When it comes to music, variety IS the spice of life and diversity is more than welcome. Expand your horizons...just because it's different from the rest of their catalog doesn't automatically make it a failure.
0	Not the best album for your next cocktail party unless you're born again I own and really liked Ms. Chenoweth's previous album, I've enjoyed her on the stage, and I also like gospel music in general. I don't think I'm anti-religion. Still, this album was a bit of a shock. It's a huge departure from her work to date and I hope just an aberration. Wikipedia calls As I Am "a mixture of hymns and contemporary Christian music... with arrangements that sound similar to adult contemporary." It also notes that "To promote the album, she made an appearance on The 700 Club." This was probably good marketing, because the only place I have heard music comparable to this is on religious cable channels. If you like lyrics about Jesus set to saccharine arrangements ("Because he lives, I can face tomorrow"), you will enjoy this album. What was she thinking? Incidentally, if you are looking for really strong reinterpretations of great gospel songs, CDs by the late Eva Cassidy contain some better choices. Taylor the Latte Boy is cute, but it's hardly worth ordering the whole album to get it. It's covered by many other artists, e.g. Susan Egan. Skip this, unless you are looking for music for a church gathering.
0	On a positive note ... About the only good thing to be said about Boston is that they aren't Rush
0	Still love the movie ... still love the soundtrack "Dirty Dancing" is still one of my favorite movies of all time. It managed to have a plot and wonderful music. You just can't sit still when this music is playing
1	Still Great My first exposure to this recording was in a music course in college in the early 60s and I always remembered it fondly, especially the Elegy, which is one of the great melodic achievements in all of music. For some reason, this never wound up in my library of vinyl and CD's, until now. The sound is incredible, easily on a par with many of today's recordings. But more impressive is the mastery of Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony. It's called Concerto for Orchestra for a good reason, and the players deliver all the appropriate virtuosity. The taut, driving rhythm, Bartok's great contribution to 20th century music, moves the music forward naturally and inexorably. Great stuff and a great model for today's new generation of conductors and musicians
0	yeah, awful What is this? His first album was great. I think this was trying to be too differnt and obscure. Like the beyond belief weird, " The omen,"( part 2 of damien) with Marilyn Manson. Most of the music backrounds and not good and dont flow. Plus some of the rhymes dont make any sense, and are just there for the sake of rhyming, " Ain't no way." And as a second album it does it justice to being way more dirty and hardcore. Just the second track alone, " bring your whole crew," DMX speaks of raping a girl, killing someone and then having sex with the corpse. I mean didnt you notice by the cover of DMX imersed in blood? I mean, "slipping," is alright and, " It's all good," " Heat." As a whole, very un-enjoyable. I would be happy never hearing this again. I mean inevative is great! But this mabye went too far, there weren't really any popular singles except for, " slippin'" A lot of people think DMX is a god, and I remember DMX being a little bothered by that. A while ago the man was busted for inpersonating a police officer and pulling someone over. No to this
0	This could have been a great album What is with the echo??? It is terrible. However, the music is great. It really upsets me. I saw them open for Pearl Jam and I thought the echo in the mic was a bad sound system, but when I listened to the album I realized he did this on purpose. Why? It could have been great
0	Yorke should not go Solo ever again If you are expecting a sound from Thom Yorke as good as the band he fronts, you will be disappointed. I do not believe this album is close to the quality of any Radiohead album. T.Yorke is too experimental with his solo debut. I am not impressed. "The Erasure" has glimpses of the brilliance of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' but doesn't come close to matching either of Radiohead's most recent releases.
0	TOTAL HACK I just can't understand who thinks this guy has any talent! REALLY! So many other funny guys...and this hack is the guy that is popular???!! AVOID this CD...wasted my money
1	Look What The Cat Dragged In With sixteen songs, the first impression is that there's got to be a lot of filler here. The good news is there's nothing but perfect Rolling Stones songs - one after another. The Stones jump around from the pondering bluesy, "Laugh, I Nearly Died" to the hard paced, "Driving Too fast" and "Rain Fall Down". Some of the fun pops up with the blatantly political, "Sweet Neo Con" and the scathing, "Look What The Cat Dragged In". It's all new, fresh and lively as hell. Producer Don Was does a fantastic job getting the Stones to produce what is arguably their best album in over two decades. Rock on
0	B Rich Iz Wack Everytime &quot;Whoa Now&quot; comes on, I flip the channel. B Rich is a disgrace to hip-hop. I hope he won't be around for a while. Look at the album cover, that's the worst I've seen. Pack yo bags and B Poor
1	Bad Boys II is the best rap album this year! "Bad Boys II" the soundtrack (Clean) is excellent and brilliant without compromise just like Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are. "Show Me Your Soul" From P. Diddy, Lenny Kravitz, Pharrell Williams, and Loon is superb. "La-La-La" From Jay-Z is excellent. "Shake Ya Tailfeather" From Nelly, P. Diddy, & Murphy Lee is dynamite. "Girl I'm A Bad Boy" From Fat Joe & P. Diddy Feat. Dre is brilliant. "Keep Giving Your Love To Me" From Beyonce is intriguing. "Realest N*ggas" From Notorious B.I.G. & 50 Cent is fanastic. "Flipside" From Freeway is excellent. "Gangsta Sh*t" From Snoop Dogg With Loon is brilliant. The rest of the tracks to the soundtrack I haven't listened to yet, but it could be as brilliant as the ones I just named off just now. Get this soundtrack now, I mean, now
0	ZZZZZzzzzzzz... Oh my, what can I say about this whispery little train wreck. It's third-rate coffee house music that struggles to be heard over conversations (as it should be). In the quiet sanctuary of my den, it's revealed for all it isn't. It isn't clever, musically or lyrically, and just drones along seemingly forever. My audiophile friends would like it because the sparse notes and little extraneous noises would make their overly analytical and fatiguing systems sound magical. Unless you're into performances that sound influenced by heavy doses of thorazine, don't bother
0	Two Great Songs Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs.
0	Better luck next album This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible. Better luck next time. If there is a next time
1	Who is Best Rapper? T I vs LiL Flip Who is Best Rapper? TI? vs LiL Flip? Yesterday a young hiphop fan asked me who i thought is a better rapper between the two, Hmm..From what i've heard TI has the flow and the subjects he speaks on its right here everyday in my life, so without any question TI. Lil flip has juice wit me but TI raps real talk i was raised in s'port LA. now its the dirty south and the youngsters of hiphop today come from every part of the world so its nice to have a choice of TI or Lil Flip verses whats not hiphop but bares the name. So to all of you old schoolers can let the young ones thought know whats real talk whats real hiphop and whats not. Big ups to both artist, BenJAMin MusiC ReaLFunkY ProducTionS
0	There's nothing in here! After all the reviews I read, this has to be one of THE 'disappointing' albums I have picked up in the recent past. The music is dated, the lyrics are poor and the overall direction seems pointless. Where is Eric taking his music? I have no idea. Drop it. There's tons of better talent out there
1	I understand I am 52 years old. I grew up (and still am growing up) listening to some of the finest rock n' roll ever produced. Jet is the only new rock band I've understood in years. What does that tell you about the sorry state of music right now? Buy Jet's CD. Get their next one as well. Listen to real rock n' roll.
1	The Bee Gees-Their Greatest Hits Fabulous-This is a must have for any Bee Gee fans. My 4 year old daughter even likes this music
1	Great album, but not MY favorite I'm a huge fan of Edwin McCain, I've had all his albums at least twice (I end up losing them since I take them everywhere). This album is certainly not a disappointment. Many of the songs will strike an emotional chord in the deepest of us, others are just good fun to listen to. There is more rock and roll style songs on this than many fans will be used to, but they're all a blast to listen to. "Write Me A Song" and "I've Seen Love" are my favorites from this one. There are also a couple satirical songs - much like "Beautiful Life" from 'Messenger. Though 'Messenger' is still my favorite McCain album, I would never pass this one up. There is no reason why any Edwin McCain fan would not like this one
0	The Review of The Century. I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad. Ths following review sums it up exactly. 21 of 36 people found the following review helpful: Deplorable......!, September 20, 2005 Reviewer: Brendan "Bren" (New York) - See all my reviews Whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched MESS of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album. Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache... And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again. Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work... I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy.
1	What a beautiful, rich CD I just stumbled on this CD by accident in a local music store, and what a wonderful find it was. Every song is a gem, the songwriting is one beautiful image after another, and the music has such depth in its sparse, seemingly simple way. Every listen just opens up more and more to me. I can't do the scholarly, professional music review, but I will say that this CD has sent me in a very short space of time to buy a copy of every other CD of his that I can find. My beginning acquaintance with those CDs just reinforces my feelings about The Animal Years. This is music that just calls you to sit, be still and enjoy watching in your mind a thing of beauty unfold. In a much too hectic world, it's a thing to treasure. Now I've just got to figure out how to make it to the coast to see one of his shows.

1	"Where do we go from here? There must be something near." I'm going to review the 12 Judas Priest CDs from 1974-1990 except the two live CDs first. I am a huge Priest fan. I first got into Judas Priest 20 years ago and have stayed loyal to them ever since. This may limit my objectivity since these reviews will really be comparing the different CDs to one another not to other bands. There is no bad Judas Priest CD, only less consistent ones. Judas Priest is a band that have repeatedly experimented stylistically. Some of these experiments were more successful than others. There are CDs that are much heavier than others. I will try and bring all these factors into my reviews as well as attempting to summarize the general consensus among hardcore Priest fans about each individual release. Judas Priest are possibly the most important act in metal history and they are certainly metal's most unwavering proponents. They helped invent heavy metal music, helped refine and perfect it, helped popularize it and have remained "defenders of the faith" during metal's darkest hours, while other "metal" acts ran for the hills. They are a legendary band whose role in popular music can not be overstated. If a metal band was not heavily influenced by Judas Priest directly, then they were heavily influenced by another band that was. Their reach is inescapable. Judas Priest are led by Rob Halford, one of metal's most recognizable icons and possibly the greatest vocalist the genre has ever known. Halford's unearthly delivery and range are as responsible as anything else for Judas Priest's signature sound. Judas Priest were not the first band to employ the services of two lead guitarists but they were certainly the first to fully implement them. Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing are both phenomenal lead soloists but it's their riffs and songwriting that have made Judas Priest one of the greatest guitar bands of all time. Both are criminally underrated in the guitar world but Downing is even underrated among Priest fans. Bassist Ian Hill rounds out the band. A founding member along with Downing, Hill is responsible for keeping the rhythm section humming along through Priest's many drummer changes. Hill is not a flashy player but is certainly competent and on the rare occasions the band's songwriting allows him to shine, he never disappoints. If this is the worst CD Judas Priest ever recorded with the first Halford/Tipton/Downing/Hill (and it may be) then that's quite a compliment because this is a stellar debut. Clearly, Judas Priest were still experimenting with their sound and trying to find their direction with this release. That being said, you can already hear the genesis of a fantastic songwriting collaboration which would make magic for the next three decades and counting. Tipton and Downing were already experimenting with integrating two guitars and their accompanying parts into a song. "Rocka Rolla" is probably their least heavy CD. It is also like many other Judas Priest CDs in that it has it's own fairly unique sound in their catalogue. Overall, you will often find yourself asking whether this is truly a metal CD at all. In my opinion, this is the only Judas Priest CD that is true of. Some of the best tracks off their second CD, "Sad Wings of Destiny" were reportedly left off this CD and that, combined with the mediocre production quality, makes you wonder how truly great this could have been. Track listing - "One For The Road" - This slower-paced blues rocker starts off the album on a poor note. It certainly isn't a bad song. It's just a little uninspired and it probably is the worst song offered here. It almost certainly was a poor choice to lead off the album. "Rocka Rolla" - Right off the bat, track 2 on their debut album, this is probably one of Judas Priest's all-time great songs. This is a fine, early example of a Judas Priest trademark, where each guitar and the bass are all playing their own riff. The magical combination of the galloping rhythm section, the sinister guitar lines and Halford's vocals really crystallizes here. There is perfectly placed harmonica at the close of the bridge section at the end of the guitar solo. This is a fantastic song, perhaps only slightly hampered by lukewarm lyrics. "Winter - Deep Freeze - Winter Retreat" - I consider these three songs to actually be one continuous song and I consider "Cheater" to be seperate altogether. If nothing else, these songs are connected thematically while not being bound by musical motif. "Winter" starts things off well, immediately suggesting the chill of Autumn's demise with a grinding guitar sound effect and echoing, ethereal vocals by Halford. Pretty good. Fairly heavy. This part comprises the bulk of the trilogy, both being longest in duration and carrying the most emotional impact. "Deep Freeze" is Downing (not Tipton as another reviewer suggested) playing some tremolo lines through distorted sound effects. Downing himself has said he doesn't like this but I do. It does what it's supposed to, suggesting a chill so cold that words can't describe. It effectively makes the transition from "Winter" to "Winter Retreat". Even if you don't like it, it doesn't last too long. Admittedly, a LOT of people seem to dislike it. "Winter Retreat" is a very light, short song. Halford's voice is literally beautiful here and the lyrics suggest the time for optimism has arrived. Which of course is why it makes no real sense (possible irony?) to connect this with... "Cheater" - Great blues-metal riff opens this song about revenge against a woman who has done our narrator wrong (and the guy she did it with too...). Perhaps the dark lyrical tone of this song would suggest to the observant the heavy musical days to come. A fantastic song overall with more strangely perfect harmonica work by Halford and highlighted by a fantastic guitar solo. I can't be sure but I believe the solo is Downing. Glenn would go on to play too many of the solos later in the band's career and this solo would appear to be evidence of that. Tipton seems to be a technically superior player and certainly tends to play faster solos, highlighted by a lot of pentatonics, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and finger tapping. Downing often plays a more soulful solo and he tends to use way more tremolo than Tipton. Of course, they're at their best when they trade off and play off of one another, highlighting each other's strengths. "Never Satisfied" - Pretty good song featuring more phenomenal vocals by Halford, especially the final wail. Unfortunately, it's a weak spot, both because of the fairly lame lyrics and because the main riff, already used too repetitively, sounds too similar to the bridge. Al Atkins removal from the band seems to have benefitted Judas Priest in two ways. Halford sings circles around him and his removal as a lyricist had to have helped that area as well. "Run of the Mill" - Clocking in at 8:33, one of Judas Priest's longest songs. One of their least metal. Also, definitely one of the most interesting lyrically of their entire career. The song deals with a person who has failed to reach their potential and has become a failure. This is a great song with some very soulful guitar work. Superlatives escape me to describe Halford's devastatingly poignant vocals. Listen closely to hear a great bass line hiding under all that guitar. "Dying To Meet You" - Schizophrenic song that starts off with a rare bass intro from Ian Hill and a slower pace overall. The song tells the story of a soldier preparing for battle and then entering combat. Halford's vocal range is put to the test here as he sings the first part of the song about as low and deep as you'll ever hear him. About midway through the songs picks up speed, the guitars take center stage and Halford's vocal delivery gets much higher pitched. Lyrically, this is the part of the song where the fighting starts. The tone of the song seems a little derisive of the soldier himself, perhaps topically reflecting many people's attitudes about the Vietnam conflict, which of course was winding down at the time. Personally, I disagree with this view but Judas Priest are almost entirely an apolitical band for better or for worse so I can forgive these very trivial differences of opinion. "Caviar And Meths" - A two minute instrumental closes the CD out. I think it's fantastic. Wordlessly sad. It's a tragedy that this was originally an eight minute long song with lyrics. I'd love to hear the full version but it's probably lost forever. I don't consider "Diamonds And Rust", Priest's cover of the Joan Baez masterpiece a song from this CD. I consider it a part of "Sin After Sin", their third CD and will talk about it there. I believe the two versions of the song to be the same version with each being produced differently. Amazon users consider this 10th out of 12 of Judas Priest's 1974-1990 CDs. I consider it dead last. That being said, it's still a great album. It's just not a great introduction to the band as a whole and a lot of fans of the heavier side of Priest may not like this album. Curious listeners should get "Screaming For Vengeance". It's not Priest's best but it's their best selling and possibly their most generally accessible and most indicative of what Priest generally sound like
0	Disappointing Given Jon Brion's Obvious Talent It seems to me that Jon Brion has a split personality as a musician. On one hand, he is an austere and formal composer in the classical sense (see his brilliant symphonic score for Magnolia). And on the other hand, he is a pop magician, creating hooks within a Beatlesesque format as a producer and songwriter. With Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jon Brion taps into the latter musical personality, and given the context of a movie score, it feels ill-suited. The scale of a movie score requires greater complexity in the composition than Brion's pop wizardry, as superlative as it is on albums by Rhett Miller, Aimee Mann, and the like, as well as on his own solo effort, Meaningless. Most of the pieces on this soundtrack are mere shells of pop songs albeit with some winds and strings. The difficulty and the sense of traditional musical history that informed the greatness of the Magnolia score is all but lost on this soundtrack. As another reviewer commented, most of the pieces are extremely short, less than two minutes. Jon Brion clearly has the brains. So why not show it?

1	4.5 stars Weller's return to form This first selfmade and coproduced solo album from the modfather was what the Style Council failed to do. In the same vein of much of what he recorded with his followup band after the jam- Weller ditched the cheesy synths and made a clean break with a more "earthy" soul sound and better production. Wellers voice also improved greatly from this point on. Songs like above the clouds- remember how we started- and bullrush all sound like council numbers in their style but they succeed on all levels- something the STC only managed a few times despite some great tunes. Into tomorrow sounds like what the Jam may have sounded like if they stayed together.(this is one of wellers best tunes still!) Part Curtis MAyfield-Marvin Gaye- with a heavy nod towards early Traffic- Paul weller rose from the ashes and became a force again. I cannot recommend this and Wildwood enough- both are essential for fans of any music- rock pop soul r+b mod. Other highlights include kosmos and Bitterness rising.

0	The lone dissenter The Schumann that is presented here is a forgery. Don't get me wrong. I'm not railing against Schumann at all. The question here is what makes Schumann great, and the way that Bernstein presents these symphonies says Schumann is great for the wrong reasons. The real Schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music. Schumann was not a hopeless romantic. He was one composer in a long line of "classicists" which ended with Brahms, yet at the same time he was an innovator, pushing forward, trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression. He had plenty of dignity, and he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him, which is exactly what it sounds like here. Bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. Yes, many of these performances are the slowest on record, but this is a BAD thing. These beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick, waxy, overly romantic textures and phrasing. Tell me, did Schumann ever write: "To be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically, with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics" in his score? No! HE DID NOT. These performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word, and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this. You may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in Karajan's filth, but that's not saying much at all. And for this slight favor Bernstein does for the music, he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit. The most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony, taken at half tempo. All semblance of melody and motion is lost. This movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first, and not the longest movement of the symphony, not to mention the longest movement in the entire set. In fact, almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing. Also, while looking at the scores, you might notice that Bernstein does away with detail work this time around. Carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand "romantic" gestures. Observing details in Schumann, ironically, helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. This isn't honest music-making here, only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art
1	Jazzy New Age Excellent music for evening reading and study. In addition, it is also prefect for evening cuddling. Should not miss this collection
0	Basic and unmoving. Unoriginal. With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once
0	HE IS JUST LIKE O'REILLY..A PRODUCT HAWKER Most radio shows will just play best of for free( btw Howard Stern invented the " BEST OF SHOW " ) ..to think he is selling it is very Bill O'Rielly. Sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck...vomit , puke
0	What a waste... The songs in this CD were sang by thousand other singers million times. Unless if it's done differently with new arrangements, new style, better performance it's a total waste. My suggestion, please find new songs, there are plenty out there. Give the new writers a chance, pay them few dollars and give them some royalties. And you IL DIVO, will sound more unique and different. After all you have great voices
0	What! Ja WHO? Can't be! This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me. This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.
1	The man has guts... If you don't care for the man's politics, that's fine. It is, after all, a free country. But the man has guts, as well as an ungodly talent for songwriting. No one is doing what he's doing been doing this long as well, and anything he releases is a gift to fans of sincere music. Peace
0	In my humble opinion - Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede). If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.
0	Children of Nuggets is minor league comp. This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much
0	Moron 5 This type of music is like a blister on the brain. You can't get rid of it and it is irritating. Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played. And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word. Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists
0	F for all accounts This guy is hyped by DG to gain entracne into Chinese market. Either he does not know the reportoir, or he is faking. I give minus five, that is -5, for listening experience and -100 for spending money. Stay away from this dude. DG is trying to make money of a bogus guy. Sound is no good when playing by CSO under outgoing Barenboim is worthless
0	Bye, Bye Miss American Songbook A long long time ago I can still remember how my sister Used to play his songs And in the 80s changed his style Songs like Love Touch were so vile And Forever Young was on the charts too long But this whole series makes me shiver With each new horror it delivers Bad and cheesy music It always makes me so sick I can't remember if I spewed when I Heard him sing "It Had To Be You" But his integrity tore in two The day the music died
1	First Band on the Moon ~ The Cardigans I was very uncertain what to expect from this band and after I had borrowed it from the library it lay on my desk for quite some time and then I was like, it can't hurt to listen to it, so I did. It is good, but not as good as I had expected. The females vocals are a bit weak and the lyrics are not their strong point. Then why do I give it four stars. Well, the sound, and vibe are great and one starts to think back on 60's pop and it is a blend of 60's pop and modern rock. The book-let is shoddy with terrible photographs that seem to have been shot by a 7 year old kid and what is up with that hair. It is called using a comb...? Even so, this is a good debut album that has some issues..
1	Simply great One of the best albums from my favorite period in jazz history. Put it in your collection
0	Not crazy about it. Might just be me--but this is one of those CD's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one. Maybe I'm too old for the rest--but wish I had kept the crystal so I could sell it on Ebay
0	Not an elitist, just enjoy good music - this mostly misses. This album is, as has been mentioned before, a followup to Rice's O -- which in my estimation was an amazing CD that warranted listening to over and over again, adding to ipod playlists, creating CD's for my wife and just generally enjoying. Creative lyrics, although sometimes inscrutable (Blower's Daughter, one of my favorite songs, but what the heck is he talking about?!), made O never get old. 9 really misses the mark. It sounds like Damien has gone through some relationship issues that are still quite raw (affair, lack of passion, confusion, bitterness?) and although this sometimes makes for very interesting music in this case it is just too far inside the angst of Damien for me to relate to. Witness a sample of lyrics from the song 'Rootless Tree': So **** you, **** you, **** you And all you didn't do I said leave it, leave it, leave it It's nothing to you And do you hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me so much That you can't let me out, let me out, let me out Of hell when you're around Let me out, let me out, let me out Hell when you're around Let me out, let me out, let me out Ok then. Then there is 'Me, My Yoke and I': My fall, my fall My fall gonna break ya My fall, my fall My fall gonna break your wall I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Like a big dog I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Like a big dog yeah My god, my god, my god Gave me a rod My god, my god, my god Gave me a rod For fishin, fishin, fishin Fishin, fishin, fishin yeah Starting to get the idea? This is a self absorbed (more than usual) album that an angst filled "alone in my teenage bedroom" songwriter has written before but had the sense to not share with the world. Oh, and 'Sleep Don't Weep' ends with like 15 minutes of a Tibetan Bowl -- an annoying tone played continuously until it bores into your very skull. Was Rice just trying to see how much his listener's would put up with? Having said all that, Lisa Hannigan shines once more in '9 Crimes' and Damien complements her very well, and you may find one or two more to strike your fancy, but overall I must say that the "emperor has no clothes" , even if others are afraid to say it
1	very talented work hello there, i just want to say that the corrs DVD AUDIO has very great sound, i had the opportunity to listen to normal CD AUDIO but this is better, you could play it better on your own computer's dvd player as well, Corrs is the best band on planet, since i used to listen to them , february 2004, i couldn't stop hearing their tunes one to another, now they will be releasing their NEW ALBUM "HOME" AT OCTOBER 2005, which it's gonna be greatful! , oh i forgot, G. Parsons "Ugh." , it's a pitty that you don't like the corrs as i do, but please don't try to humiliate them, i know you are a good human being as everybody, Corrs have their own prestige and it's not a subject of discutio
0	Rated 0 For Garbage! Yayo needs to stick to being a criminal...but then again he wasn't even good at that
1	Their finest hour Most people think that the heavily overrated Black album is Metallicas best CD. I completely disagree. This would be their best CD. Although this band was never as good as Megadeth or Slayer, this CD is still an epic in metal. This CD is their most technical release. The guitars are very complex, and while they cannot compete with the brutality of Slayer or the technicality of Megadeth, they are still complex, with lots of crushing riffs and wailing solos, as well as many melodic parts. You can't hear the bass very well, but the guitars more than make up for it. The drums are great. Too bad Metallica would follow up their best CD with their sellout album, then sink into the mainstream. This CD is awesome enough, but Rust In Peace is even better
1	Unique understanding of Brahm's first concerto This version simply eclipses all the versions which I have previously listened to - and this is my favourite piano concerto ! Praise must also be given to Szell and LSO, for the orchestral part is the equal of the piano. The remastered sound is a great success. Full marks
1	Delectable Me oh my, what an outrageously good record this is. I had never heard of The Stone Roses until my brother played me &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; a few years ago. I loved the song, but I thought they would be a band very much like The Smiths or The Cure (which isn't a bad thing at all, I just wasn't interested at the time), so I never followed up and bought any of their albums. Thankfully, my father received this cd from my brother for his birthday a few months ago, and I've had the pleasure of listening to it everyday since then. All of these songs exude an indomitable vitality that lends an extra cachet to the already stellar music. There is a distinctive 80s sounds to The Roses, but after listening to all the material present on The Very Best Of, it's apparent that these songs transcend their era and will always remain as timelessly great pop confections. Highlights of this recording include the ebullient &quot;What the World is Waiting For&quot;, the dreadfully pleasing &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;, and the anthemic numbers &quot;Made of Stone&quot; and &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot;. I highly recommend this to all
0	Tony Bennett...er, Eric Clapton I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with "friends", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner? Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen
0	Nobody likes a show off.. ...particularly one who falsely refers to himself as a prince and who produces trash like this. When Doves Cry is an unashamed rip off of MC Hammer's excellent Pray and the title track is far too long for my liking. Save your money.
0	Neutral Milk Hotel Ripoff I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about. Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s. It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists. Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree
0	Ja Rules fans are dumb as hell! READ THIS Yo i hate when people like ja dont speak the truth. He talks about all this (...) like he went through it but hes just lying. He's a WANKSTA and im not sayin that cause i support 50 cause i hate 50. But hes got a point when he talks about ja. If your a ja fan you are being lied to and wasting your money when your supporting a true wanksta. Yo ja stop stealing Pac's words if he were alive he would never role wit you. If you want to be lied to and hear the most annoying voice and waste your money by this album or other ja albums

0	2 and a half stars "Howl" comes so close to being good. They capture a real authentic "backporch" sound, with great production. The lyrics are passable, the singing isn't too obnoxiously affected. But there just aren't any good songs on here. It's like when you meet someone who dresses well, seems to share some common interests, and can make small talk like a champ. But then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting, and just sort of suck all around. Well, it's the musical equivalent of that. They set a great vibe for beer drinking, sitting on the porch, etc. Just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel. But nice as they sound, whales don't write good music and niether do the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. Alot of people see music's primary function as providing a nice background. I'm sure they'll be pretty happy with this cd. Also, a lot of people are lifeless zombies with no souls.
0	Wrong CD I had ordered this CD for my husband.He likes the movie "The Longest Yard" and he wanted to get the soundtrack of the movie. Unfortunately at the time of ordering it did not specify what songs were included in the CD, but I thought if it was from The Longest Yard movie, then it would be the soundtrack.Well, I received the package and gave it to my husband for him to open, he started playing it and was very disappointed.He ended up getting a CD full of stupid rap songs. I am not happy with what I received, if I could send it back and get something else I would,but I know it will be a hassle to even ask for an exchange.My suggestion to other people is to find out exactly what they're lookin for before placing an order and just because the cover looks like the original,it does not mean it's what you're really looking for. I only spent $12.00 which is a good thing, but it could have lost a lot more. Thank you
0	Not So Immaculate Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's. This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since.
0	Mediocre Rapper Takes Over The World! First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes. He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like "Who Cares?" But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's "Nothing Left To Lose." The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself
0	Thanks, but no thanks. Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album. Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead. While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums. On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty. &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow. I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL. The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots. Well let me tell ya, this is far from it. I know. I remember
1	Tres belle I don't speak a word of French beyond tourist phrase-book niceties. I discovered this album when I was an undergraduate, in the Undergrad listening library at the University of Washington (Seattle). I love the sound. Still do. My music tastes range from Metallica to Vivaldi to the Carter Family, and this album has its own special niche in my heart.

1	It's a Beautiful Day I'm a U2 diehard fan from Chile, and i love their music. The new 2 songs are excelent. This compilation incorpores a beautiful booklet with details of the chart position when each single was launch in USA and UK. U2 has an important place in my life - and i wonder what a lot of people in the world think and feel the same -, so we must celebrate, and wait until the new record is edited - and the begining of the new tour -. If you love U2, you must have this cd.
1	The Purple Genius Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe. Here it is. All the grooves are present. All the funk. The indulgent boudoir ballads. The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity. * Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting. Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years. He then went home and continued to write songs. Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove. Without normal distribution, however, it "only" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single. Crazy stuff. There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles. * There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent. Music is his life. He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance. What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all. The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set. * I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time. Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording. I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is "too good" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time. Also, there's no filler, nor is there a "theme" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard! It's so good that it's almost hard work!
0	A Poor Man's Michael Jackson Meets R.kelly Prince is Talented,though I can't remember when I last heard it because he has dropped plenty of wack Music for a really,really long time.in hindsight He is basically a Musical Version of Puffy.meaning while Prince can play,He ain't never done anything remotely Original.He was in the late 70's through the 80's a Poor Man's Michael Jackson.then fast forward to the 90's on this long-winded Album he was trying to Jack R.kelly's style.interesting irony is that Michael Jackson&R.kelly could do Prince's whole thing in there sleep,but when he tired to Emulate them He comes across even more Corny than He already is.He will touch the King of Pop MJ&the King of R&B R.Kelly so maybe in the future Prince will find some Originality??I doubt it.He just bites off everyone.wasted Talent
0	Two Star Average...Hahaha Let's face it. Rap/hip-hop basically killed itself during the turn of the century. With no talent retards like 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Nelly, Ludacris, Lil Jon, D4L, and a million others dumbing it down with processed fake lyrics and repetitive beats that drive real music fans crazy. It's horrid, I tell you. With a bunch of guest appearances by other mainstream hacks and horrible vocabulary, no wonder the society has gone corrupt. Hopefully this hack will stop rolling around in the money and get a job at the local gas station. If you want good rap, go for N.W.A., Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, and anything the members in those bands have done. For talented music in general, go for Between The Buried and Me, Unearth, Chimaira, Necrophagist, Dying Fetus, Aborted, The Black Dahlia Murder, Despised Icon, Darkest Hour, Meshuggah, Cryptopsy, basically anything that I give good reviews on.
0	P.O.Esssss. Nice going puto you set my buddy and his race back 200 years during your 15 minutes of fame
1	Daring Divine Delbert A fan of Mr. D's for many years and appreciating his uniqueness and sense of humor always shown in his music. Track #8 Down in Mexico is a song not to be missed with anyone with ears muchless a fan. Saw Delbert perform it live on 2/14/06 in Lex KY the best sound I've ever heard in concert; any genre. This CD offers subtle surprises and big smiles. Pashaswife
0	Copies Amazed power-ballad success way too much Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort. I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from "Amazed" syndrome. Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad. Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics. Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them. These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this.
1	cd The cd arrived in good condition and i got it within a couple of days
1	Love, Love, Love "The Nightfly". My first introduction to Donald Fagen, was his "New Frontier" video on MTV, which was in heavy rotation in 1983. Brillant video that accurately protrayed the story related in a great song. (A special thanks to all the people who have posted the "New Frontier" video on You Tube.) I loved the song and the video. Years later with "New Frontier" stuck in my head on a constant mental replay track, I bought "The Nightfly", and was amazed by how brillant the album was. The first shock was hearing "I.G.Y-International Geophysical Year", which I still hear on the radio, but never knew it was Donald Fagen. This is the first song on the album, followed by more wonderful songs. It's a concept album, with the theme of the Atomic Age/New Frontier movement of the late 1950's and early 1960's. It captures both the optimism of new technology leading the way, with the underlying hint of fear, that some of this Atomic Age technology might be the end of the world. The pop culture references in some of the songs are wonderful, as they help convey the feeling of that time. The song "New Frontier" has several references-actress Tuesday Weld from "The Many Lives of Dolby Gillis" and Jazz great Brubeck are mentioned in it. As far as concept albums go, I would put this up there with Pink Floyds "The Wall" or "Dark Side of the Moon". It is much closer to "Dark Side" musically. The best thing about "The Nightfly" is it's mellow, with catchy hooks and grooving rhythms. It's great to listen both actively to hear the stories convenved in the songs, but also works if you just want nice background music. Some of songs are also fun for dancing too. I can listen to this entire album from start to finish, happy with every song on it. It's a rare for an artist to be able to put out an album like that. I'd love to see the videos made for this album released on DVD
0	Wots, Uh, The Deal? Amazon's review for this is ridiculous; "zeppelin's one true disappointing album" (what about hourses of the holy, precense, in through the out door hmm?) "there is some classic material here"?!?! I have no idea what they're talking about. This is the worst "odds and sods" album ever released. Its truly insane to listen to this, and think this is what the band thought was good stuff to release from the vaults. It shows Page's poor mental state at the time; he seems to have truly lost it due to heroin. Or maybe this is all the stuff that was in the vaults? That seems unlikely, but perhaps that's the only way to explain this. Did they really release everything they recorded? The mind boggles! Nobody does that; you don't record 12 songs for a 12 song album, you record 30, 35 and whittle it down to the best songs. If Zeppelin truly just recorded and released everything they wrote, that would be amazing. It would be unlike any other band ever. Sorry I dwell so long on that. It's just I do not want to talk about "the music" on this album. Its so incompatiable with Zeppelin's legacy, and it is truly a complete embarasment to the band, or it should be. This stuff doesn't even qualify for THE FIRM for Gods sake! As cynical as I am about Led Zeppelin, they could really get me rocking at their best; they were majestic, mythical, AND rocking, all at the same time! They were a good band with good music, that always at least had interesting sounding material. This stuff wouldn't have made the grade on the sex pistols album; its that bad. Don't buy this; even if you're vaguely interested, don't buy this. If you like Zeppelin, you won't after this! Or maybe you'll just be a drone and use words like "lost classic." If you do, you are a goofy SOB
1	A truly excellent musical It is a shame to learn that Kopit and Yeston purchased the rights to the Pantom of the Opera but were usurped by Andrew Lloyd Webber as it was in the public domain in Enland. Otherwise, we would have this marvelous music to listen to as much as we now listen to Webber's work. In a way we are fortunate that Webber's work can be heard as well as Yeston's work as the latter was allowed to publish in the US. Still, it is sad to realize that the public mainly ignores this work as they think first, that it even exists and second, that it is inferior to the Webber's work. The fact is that Phantom is excellent in its own right and has great songs such as "Home", "Melodie de Paris" and "Who Could Have Dreamed Up You". I highly recommend it to anyone.
0	The Sound of One Band Aging I have been so underwhelmed by this tepid album since it came out, but I thought I'd give it a little time to do a little aural sneak-attack and start to "grow on me". No such luck. This release is so thoroughly forgettable that after the few times I've listened to it, paying strict attention and trying hard to feel something ( in a feeble attempt to assuage my self-inflicted guilt for shelling out hard-earned dough for this...ummm....music), I can't say I remember a single passage or sentence from this bland offering. And what I'm comparing it to is the sheer brilliance of previous recordings, emotionally supercharged songs like " Carry the Zero" or "Kicked it in the Sun" that really affected me profoundly the first coupla times I heard them and have stuck with me for years. All I can sense here is the grayness of a group of musicians who don't even really have the energy (or sense) to coast on the punch their early outings conjured up so deftly. Even the obligatory Neil Young ( a true creaky old dude if their ever was one) noodling is so embarrassingly derivative and uninspired you just wanna pat these guys on their sweatered backs and guide them to a comfy chair. I'm giving this one a one star not in comparison with other bands but compared to what Built to Spill used to be capable of. Maybe it's the fame, maybe it's the fortune, but this is a band that has truly lost its teeth. Pray god they score some dentures before they muster the energy to inflict more sonic gummings on their hapless fanbase.....
0	Stop The Madness! It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times. Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived. The problem, of course, is his voice. The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless. For starters, he has almost no range at all. Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices. By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective. Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice. He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes. Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project. Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter. If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth. Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded. But that's the problem. On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity. Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted. Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits. To be avoided at all cost.
1	You just can't stop dancing When I listen to this CD, I and my friends are instantly tempted to dance. This is a fine CD to have
0	Could have been so much better What a shame that gems such as Longfellow Serenade, Signs, Lady-Oh and Both Sides Now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that DO appear. Given Mr. Diamond's long and illustrious career, this release disappoints. Again, what a shame. So much potential and so little fulfillment
1	Keep 'em Coming Another good CD from Jimmy! Need to keep the studio CD's coming and not take so long between. This CD has a great mixture of vocals from several country stars and some good tunes with Buffett solo. Trip Around The Sun with Martina is great
1	Saw it and loved it Maybe you need to see it in the context of the show. I loved the show and the cast recording. To each his own
1	it dont get no better I have to agree with an earlier review-this is a true desert island disc.my favorite jj album.sultry guitar and terrific songs.this is an underrated masterpiece.&quot;cherry&quot; would make the price worth it.&quot;i'm a gypsy man&quot;&quot;let me do it to you&quot;not a wasted note on the whole thing.dont miss it
1	beautiful...makes me think of the film! This is a wonderful album that is filled with color and life (not unlike the movie). We have a great cross-section of sounds represented here. "Rose de Castilla," a beautiful, all-vocal song, takes us back to Michoacan, where the Sanchez Family gets their start, before the father, Jose, walks across the border to Los Angeles ("a line in the dirt in those days"). We also hear the energetic music of the 1950s ("Angel Baby" by Jeanette Hurado and "Que Rico El Mambo" by Perez Prado). This transports us to the lives of the first generation of Sanchezes, born in the United States, raised by their Mexican-born parents. We also have some lively merengue (in the form of "Guavaberry" by Juan Luis Guerra y 4.40). You all will love this CD!!!
1	Wow, that was dreamy. I am one of the few who believe that "Isn't Anything" is leagues better than "Loveless". This is one of my favorite albums; therefore, it's one of the few albums I've actually purchased. "Isn't Anything" isn't really one of the most uplifting albums of all time, but it is undoubtedly original and I might even add, influencial. The lyrics are beautiful and heartfelt, the vocals are what really makes the album so dreamy. Kevin Shield's voice is like a blur, and I don't even know what a blur sounds like. "No More Sorry" is what really made the album for me, personally, it just flows very well. This isn't really an album you'd want to just listen to the drumsticks hit the drums and the pics hit the guitar, no, you should concentrate very hard on the lyrics. Maybe, you'll even pick up the messege 'My Bloody Valentine' are trying to send across. Of course though, that's a different messege for everyone
1	A great and beautiful musical! I very very highly recommend this musical. It is such a sweet love story, with wonderful songs. Sadly not many people know about the musical "Carnival," based on the film, "Lili." It is definitly a gem. The song that especially touched me, was the hauntingly beautiful, "Her Face." It's such a romantic musical with unforgetable cute songs and romantic ones as well
1	Dylan's Second Album Masterpiece After careful consideration this was the Dylan album I chose to buy. And I do not regret buying it nor should anyone. This is a masterpiece. Not many people can make an album that holds you from track 1 to the end. The Beatles, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan all can keep you sittin' on the edge of your seat. Great timeless songs on here are of course Blowin' In the Wind a song that breaks generation barriers. The lovely Girl From North Country, Bob Dylans Bob Dylan's Blues, Masters of War, and many more. Without a doubt a must have in any Dylan collection. Your not a Dylan fan if you don't have this
0	A Big Disappointment I expected alot more from the CD! I expected more or what Creedance Clearwater Revival WAS....The songs on the CD weren't the best & the quality of the CD was only average.This is not worth the time or the money! And I'm a BIG FAN of 60's Rock!! Try Buffalo Springfield, or Crosby, Still, Nash & Young or Janis Joplin with Big Brother & the Holding Co. And the old Stand By's: Beatles & Stones!! Long Live Rock & Roll!
1	Great album to listen to together! My five-year-old daughter and I really love this CD. The covers are great "versions" of the originals, and the original tracks are great additions to the overall feel of this CD. Maroon 5's "Pure Imagination" is fantastic, as is The Dixie Chick's "The Rainbow Connection." It's a great CD to listen to together and it doesn't drive you crazy after the fifth time because it's kinda "rockin'". If your children are strictly into "kiddie" types of music, i.e. Laurie Berkner, this probably isn't going to be their thing. My daughter is older and is, thankfully, expanding her musical tastes. This is something we both enjoy, minus the singing veggies and all...I highly recommend this to more mature children
0	Rebirth, eh? That's both pretentious and funny. When used in the music industry, the term rebirth would indicate erasing the slate and starting anew, and presenting yourself as something different. Perhaps Jennifer Lopez thought of this knowing that her singing career was in decline, and opted to give her fourth album the title Rebirth. Is there any legitimate sign of a rebirth on this album, you ask? A few songs in, and the answer is clearly no. The songs are still built on synthetic arrangements with synths and samples where real instruments could be, the lyrics are still some of the most shallow you'll ever hear, Lopez still isn't doing much in the way of writing, and her thin voice still sounds the same way it did on her first album. You would think by now that with all the time that Lopez has spent as a recording artist that some aspects of her output would have improved, but that is not the case. If the Lopez faithful (who made her first two albums multi-platinum hits) need any proof how weak her voice is, listen to some of the songs here, including the single "Get Right" - she TALKS her way through a lot of these tracks. That's right, not singing or rapping, but talking. You have to hear them to know what I mean. Did you ever stop to think that she doesn't perform live because she can't sing a note in tune? One thing I'll give her credit for is that at least she isn't taking advantage of her fans by performing "live" concerts while miming the whole thing (like those hacks Britney Spears and Hilary Duff). The material is so weak that it's little wonder why her fan base has eroded as of late, despite her high profile. In summary: Not being true to its title, Rebirth is instead a continuation of the weak bubblegum pop and lite R&B sounds that we've come to expect from Jennifer Lopez. In short, expect more studio-enhanced singing, more synthetic music and more lyrics so weak that even Black Eyed Peas would have rejected them. You can definitely do better than this album - just don't expect to hear it on the "hit music" station
0	Baaa baaa, music for sheep (0 stars) Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity.
0	??????? I havent listened to these guys since vaseline way back in the early 90's........after reading rave reviews about this album, here on amazon, i had to see what the fuss was about... The first couple of tracks are ok.....especially the first one, that is the best song off the album....as i got further down the trackilisting, they start to all sound the same.... how about the singer, if my memory is correct, he is that crazy looking clown like idiot with huge red puffy hair..... i think his voice is so stupid, its not even funny.....oh and the lyrics, come on now.....they are ABSOLUTELY ridiculous If you consider yourself as one of those worm type little people, that rootes for guys like roger from the nerds.....this is your type of music...
0	Thunderstorms Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only.
1	One of my favorite kid's albums so far... What a fun album! My 18 month old boogies like crazy to these tunes -- and they are varied enough and laced with some grown up humor that I don't want to run from the room hearing it over and over. It doesn't have thay syrupy sweet sound found in so many kids' albums. Try it - you won't regret it
1	Tiesto changed I honestly dont understand why does every artist in Electronic Music trying to change so much. Take for example Ferry Corsten... what happened to his beautiful tear-jerking tunes back when Right of Way was in. If you ever saw him, you'd know how incredibly tallented he is. Now he, as many others, have jumped on teh POP based train. Tiesto, definitely puts a nice show on with his epic trance set presented on this cd.... however, like many say, I really miss his 2003 2004 days... if you ever heard a live set from those days, definitely his 2 DVD-s... now that is quality. As far as sound production, mad props to the sound engineers... by far it is the clearest highest quality sounding cd i have ever heard. Song selection wise, hmmm as always, i could pick better, but I guess everyone has a different style, in what they like. I still stand by saying, GO SEE THE MAN LIVE!
1	The Album You Buy For A First Timer Have that friend who likes good music but doesnt know Cocteau Twins? Give em this one and watch the obsession fly
0	Avoid the CD! OK, I figure if you're looking at this CD, you're a Laurie Anderson fan and can recall at least twice you've seen her great concert movie, likely at a midnight showing back in the 80's. Well, if you're that person, avoid the utter heartbreak which is this CD. I counted 18 tracks from my old VHS copy of this concert, while only 8 made it to the CD. The banter between tracks is omitted entirely. The tracks are out of order (OK, small nitpick), and it's certainly not worth the effort. I'm sorry, Laurie, but Warner scr-wed you hard on this one. On the up side, the sound quality is good, certainly better than my VHS. But hey, this is a concert film soundtrack, but apparently they forgot to include the second disk. Laurie fans will be livid. (Others merely confused! :
1	Powerful and passionate.... A lot of people really freaked out when Dylan became a born again Christian. I remember reading that he appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1979 right around the time this album got released, and that the cast and staff were terrified of his Christianity. I find their paranoia silly. Much of Dylan's work dealt with God and religious & spiritual issues anyway, here it was just made more explicit. This is one of Dylan's best albums. His voice is filled with passion, and these songs are excellent. All of these songs still hold true today. Slow Train, Gotta Serve Somebody, Precious Angel, and When You Gonna Wake Up? are my favorites here. There isn't one wasted song on the whole album. Even if you're not religious, you can listen to this. This is a great spiritual record. It isn't overly preachy, and it isn't sanctimonious. It's just really sincere, like all great art. Dylan rules...
0	Kasabian has run out of ideas I like several songs on Kasabian's old album but there were also many poor ones. Still on this album I dont know if i could say that there are any songs better than Club Foot, Reason Is Treason, and Processed Beats. It seems Kasabian has gone psychedelic and also run out of ideas in the process, there is nothing special or creative on this album
1	The Continued Evolution of a Genius Anyone who talks about &quot;fading genius&quot; in reference to this album is out of their mind. It is true that by the time Sly released &quot;Heard ya missed me...&quot; the band had hit the nadir of its creative output, but their downward slope did not start until well after this album was recorded. &quot;Small Talk&quot; is in fact a brilliant follow up to Fresh, and a brilliant acheivement in it own right. The album retains the positive lyrical content, but it redirects that positivity toward more personal and family oriented themes. The arrangements are less in your face, the feel is a lot more relaxed, and there is even a lot of (absolutely wonderful) studio chatter to preface certain songs. Sly could never release two similar albums in a row, so for this album he broke with protocol in another senese that a lot of these reviewers don't get: &quot;Small Talk&quot; is a SOUL album. Here is why: The grooves are subtler and more sedate, violins are involved (but not in a cheesy way), and there is a new emphasis on gutwrenching, heartfelt vocals. Indeed, both Sly and Rosie turn in their best vocal performances here. I think many of the people who have reviewed &quot;Small Talk&quot; here on Amazon have missed this point entirely, but you might miss it as well. So, if you're looking another agressive funk album the likes of Riot or Fresh, you will also be severely dissapointed by &quot;Small Talk&quot; and should not buy it. However, if you like albums like Donnie Hathaway's &quot;Everything is Everything,&quot; or if you Cymande's downtempo stuff, or Charles Wright and the 103st Rythym Band, then spare no expense and immediately purchase this Japanese import. This is one of the best SOUL albums ever recorded (which is not to say it's not funky.) If you bought &quot;The Essential Sly and the Family Stone&quot; like I did, you've already heard Time For Livin' and Loose Booty. Like me, you probably thought they were solid tracks but would not persuade you to buy a 30 dollar CD. Well, after hearing Small Talk in its entirety I can honestly say that those are the two WEAKEST tracks on here. Sly was a genius and this album chronicles his continued evolution. It is a must have for anyone who likes Sly, soul, funk, or even just music. The fact that this Small Talk is not available in America is a profound statement about the way our nation treats its visionaries and cultural giants
0	Do Yourself a Favor... Buy a Weezer album instead. I don't really get the comparison to the Beach Boys, but the lead singer of this band does a pretty decent Rivers Cuomo imitation.
0	IT SNIKES THIS IS THE WORST SONG I LISTED TO IN MY LIFE IT SOUND LIKE A BANRE
0	Lame, and not original..... Never seen the band live but this CD is a big disappointment. The sound is a low budget version of Santana / Los Lonely Boys. The songs are lame and way too commercial. Hope their next album turns out to be better (a lot)
0	I dont like crunk This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists
1	this is a very good C.W. album but not the best This is one of the better albums of C.W.McCall's tunes. I've been looking for years for a copy of the Wolf Creek Pass album. I have it on a worn out 8-track and can't seem to locate it anywhere else. With songs like Nite Rider, Old Sloan,Classified, 4-Wheel Drive, Old Thirty and more. This one will serve as a substitute till I can find one
0	Not worth the money; not worth the time When I was vacationing in London this past May I spotted this new Morcheeba CD at the store. I bought it and couldn't wait to get it in the CD player. Having only discovered this group a couple of years ago with the "Parts of the Process" compilation, I had fallen in love with the easy grooves and Skye Edwards talented, sultry voice. (Listen to "The Sea" and then follow it up with "Undress Me Now" and you'll understand the magic in the range of her voice.) Imagine my extreme disappointment when I heard "The Antidote." Skye is gone, replaced my a singer with a lower register and very little range. At times the new singer's voice grated on my nerves so much, I had to move to the next track. The CD was a waste of money and the hour I took to listen to it is an hour I will never get back. News reports say the new singer is already gone and will be replaced, not by Skye, but by yet another new girl. After the brillance of the pre-"Antidote" library, I am forced to wonder: What were the guys thinking
1	a rarity i got hooked with "spinning", and then i reallized the whole album is just awesome, just awesome
1	Best song help I can give . . . To everyone who is in search of a song from the movie go to this link for a scene by scene song list: http://imdb.com/title/tt0286499/board/nest/224815 I hope this helps
0	Is this what I waited for all this time???? Once "Let's Get Free" came out, it lauched a revolutionary group that was powerful in their lyrics and made you feel their whole message. After damn near burning another whole in this disk, I picked up their mixtape. It was alright but I was waiting for that 2nd full length album continuing from the debut album. I bought this on the 1st day it was released and was highly disappointed. Most of the beats sound the same. The album length is entirely TOO short. I would have given this 3 stars because the album content is not awful. But Dead Prez loses a lot of credibility when on the SAME ALBUM you say "turn off the radio" and 5 tracks later you collaberate on a song with Mr. Radio himself, Jay-Z. That loses a star right there. Was this an attempt to appeal to the very radio stations that you constantly blast for not playing real hip-hop? Well, I live in the major city of Philadelphia and I haven't heard about this song burning up the airwaves nor did I hear about it topping the Billboard music charts. Great job, guys
0	and im juss feelin srry 4 him this cd is not all that....srry 2 all my girls but 2 tell u the truth he needs 2 sit down!!!!!

0	Thirty Seconds is still too much Let's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is. I will start by saying I didn't play the 30 second snippet for "All I Want To Do" because I knew it was already a lost cause, the rest were all just as bad. There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k. and they are "Can't Cry Anymore", and "We Do What We Can". I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge don't be decieved. I don't know what she's like, or anything like that, but I do know she's beautiful, but while talented it's not the music I seek to listen to.
1	For The Piano Lover Oh, Wow! This is a cd that will be liked by all who enjoy David Lanz, Mehdi, George Winston, Yanni, or even Secret Garden. it is the very essence of good new age. So tranquil, yet so spirited (and finally a picture of the Kern on the coverart!), this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection, I just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again. I am amazed! It reminds me somewhat of George Winston, but still very unique. This is music to the soul. Absolutely relaxing, as well. I ALSO RECOMMEND: Mehdi ~ Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 ..Truly a Gem...Samples are at SoothingMusic,Com...Just Listen.
0	no good yo this album was overrated and for no reason i'm not gone say that's it's plain garbage but if they had a betta team lyrical wise and a better production team then they would be alright. the best tracks on the whole thing is shawnna's gettin' some and the track call that's my S**
1	&lt;-- Damn, They Did It Again --> My fancy apple pie a la mode gives me a happy face and shiny brown eyes. Knowing that I am an Independent Woman. I know I can find a sexy daddy who will bring me emotion and make me feel like I'm dangerously in love. Even though........ My story of beauty has a sweet, sassy gospel melody. I know I am talented. Forever I am not a nasty girl, I am forever bootylicious and I have my mother to thank. So I want to say thank you. But my goal in life is to become a suvivor like Destiny's Child did when they recorded this album.
0	No So Interesting My wife introduced my to Tift Merritt's music when we were dating ... so I've got a soft spot for Tift and was really looking forward to hearing her second album, Tambourine. I'm disapointed. There's not mush to this album. It's lost the alt-country sound and is more of a boring pop album. Bramble Rose is much, much more interesting
1	Wow! This is my seventh Evans recording and it is like I am getting to know him all over again. This album has energy, freshness and joy that just isn't there on later recordings. The recording quality is more than satisfactory. The group's playing is smart and engaging with a skillful balance between technical skill and understated musicality. The playfulness brought to standards like Witchcraft is a welcome contrast to many of his later more brooding works. LaFaro and Motian provide their legendary support and interplay with their typcial flair. This was definitely a high point for Evans, before drugs, bad health and personal problems got in the way. No Evans collection would be complete without this recording
0	You know exactly what you are going to get... Michael Flatley's feet fly like a racehorse, but he is really a one trick pony. Now, if you like that one trick, you will like this (and every other) cd,and stageshow of his. If you are looking for something new, a progression of creativity, and expression, look elsewhere. When Riverdance first appeared, I was a fan of the inovative blending of Broadway, traditional Irish step dancing, and new age mysticism. And The talent of all involved is undeniable. But after other troops appear imitating the idea,and doing so almost as well. You must wonder why this artist deserves the loyalty of consumers buying the same , repackaged material over and over again. Darwin would say that those things that don't evolve and adapt will become extinct. Unfortunately, it appears to be a slow lumbering death,for the thundering feet of this dinosaur
1	One of his best ever There and Back was a change of pace for Jeff Beck. His sound became more electronic. This is a departure of his previous albums, Blow by Blow and Wired. Personally this along with Blow by Blow and Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop are my three favorte Jeff Beck albums ever. The two songs on this CD that will open your ears and get your attention are, Star Cycle. The entire album is worth the price of the CD. Star Cycle is not only great guitar but great keyboard as well. The combination of the two is outstanding. The Pump is also on this album. The Pump is probably in my top 5 for the best Jeff Beck songs ever. Jeff Beck uses distortion in much the same way Jimi Hendrix used it to augment his guitar style. No Jeff Beck collection is complete without this album. This is my mind is one of the outstanding albums in Rock history. Jeff Beck is a master guitarist and this CD will show you why
0	Umm.... I'm a bit confused here..... I can respect cutting-edge and new ideas. But this CD is neither
0	Never recived Had to get a credit because Vendor never shipped and would not respond to email
0	Journey - 'Trial By Fire' (Sony) Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player
1	The Best CD ever!... What a way to start the new year!... This CD is awesome! There are four songs on the CD from Cinderella II, with Brooke Allison giving it her all and shining brightly. The new version of Bibbidi Bobbidid Boo is wonderful! They took the classical version from long ago and gave it a new twist which is sure to delight everyone of all ages! If you have enjoyed Walt Disney forever, like myself, or are just tuning in, you will love this album!..
1	Beautiful Voices Bought this CD for my wife who is a big fan of traditional Irish music. I love the beautiful voices. The voice & instruments mix are very clear; one is not over powering the other
1	It is never the end when you are a fan for life The doors continue to be a band I have new experiences with. It is a great tribute that presents the mystical sounds and strange songwriting that is only capped off by the voice and presence of Jim Morrison. This two CD package is an integral part of my music collection, but more importantly it is because it is a truly great collection of their music. Even if you are a younger person who is new to the Doors, this is a great place to start if you so choose! I had the original set and later retired it to acquire the Digitally Remastered version shown here on Amazon. All the classic door songs are here, which on the first CD include songs like "Break on through", "Love me two times", and the dark and dreamy "Spanish Caravan". CD Number 2 is no less important with songs that range from "L.A. Woman", "Riders on the storm" to one of my favorites called "The Unknown Soldier". Overall it is an amazing collection of hits when you just take a step back and look at what you get if you purchase this
1	Great CD This is a great cd to listen to. If you like Patsy Cline you will definitely want this cd. Not every singer can do Patsy justice but LeAnn does and I would certainly recommend this cd
0	Not Worth the Time or Money Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000. This album is representative of their entire catalogue. For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album. Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither. Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music. The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next. The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content. This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock
1	Bulgarian Dancehall Gypsy violin, dancehall beats, horns somewhere between Jazz Jamaica and Klezmer, transylvanian-intoned singer. Wry lyrics. Simply a blast. Bought this blind and I love it
1	The best metal album ever! THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM AND BAND I'VE EVER HEARD BETTER THAN METALLICA, PANTERA, MEGADETH, FAITH NO MORE ETC. ETC. ETC. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY WAR ENSEBLE DEAD SKIN MASK AND SEASONS IN THE ABYSS
1	THE BEST OF THE BEST A+++ THE BEST IVE EVER HEARD BYE THE DODRO MASTE
0	fair...just fair the offspring..a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around(the damned, TSOL, agent orange, adolescents, and DI), have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from TSOL, The Damned, and other great legendary punk artists, and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this. i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash..after that, i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still, i loved them..but i was iffy on this..i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were, but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer...i must say, i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it...that was 3 years ago. now, i think this album is just okay..i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop, but as for keeping the disc, it isnt. i say get this..get it cheap..rip it to your comp and then sell off. it gets old fast
1	The absolute best primer for Jazz initiates While my musical tastes span a wide range of genres, I've long been intrigued by jazz and the blues - both are enigmatic and haunting, yet not exactly a part of popular music today. So it was with great expectations that I purchased this set, hoping for a strong foundation upon which I could explore the giants of jazz - and eventually work my way down to contemporary jazz artists. This collection fits that bill beyond compare. Some favorites I already knew are here, such as Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman - along with sublime jazz geniuses such as Coleman Hawkins, Count Basie, and Charlie Parker. Sure, as other reviewers have noted, the set is a bit heavy on Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, but I doubt you'll be disappointed with any of the tracks included here. Aside from the wonderful music, you also receive an informative and beautifully designed booklet. It includes not only an essay on the origins of jazz, but a song-by-song write up that's unequaled by any other collection I've purchased. I'm more than up to date on jazz music, as well as gaining a profound appreciation for the genre. Simply put, if you're curious about jazz as I once was, this is the absolute perfect way to initiate yourself into the library of jazz. (On a side note, if you want a great blues primer, I'd suggest the Martin Scorsese set.
0	When are they gonna make another Art of Trans? GRitS are at their best when the underlying foundation of a song is a strong (catchy) melody. Witness "They All Fall Down," and "Here We Go." On "Redemption," Coffee and Bone seemed to have abandoned their original purpose of making the most innovative hip-hop in the industry and have made an album that merely bites what is on the playlist of any top 40 rap station in the country. Under the guidance of the production team of Otto Price and Ric Robbins, collectively known as Incorporated Elements, GRitS made their most memorable hits: all of which followed the above-mentioned formula. Now these 3 albums, made after their departure/dismissal, have exposed Bone and Cof's greatest weakness: the inability to make compelling beats. - FYI: Pigeon John makes "Open Bar" the strongest track.
0	Continual Slide Mack 10 seems to have lost it. Like Ice Cube with War and Peace, he tries to sound hard with an edge but you can tell he's trying too hard. He seems to have lost his hunger along with Ice Cube after the Westside Connection album. This is probably 10's worst album has he continues to fall. WC's the only hope for the old Westside Connection. Mack 10's gangsta believability is very very questionable after putting out a pretty lousy album here
0	Practice Doesn't Always Make Perfect I vividly remember when this album came out, it was among a handful that ushered in the hippie era. Of course one always associates the Grateful Dead with LSD, the Hell's Angels, and poor personal hygiene. But their contribution goes far beyond that. Music was the life's-blood of Flower Power, and what this album loudly proclaimed was that anyone, anyone, no matter how talentless and drug-addled, could start a band, provided that access to a garage was no problem. This came as welcome news to the legions of talentless, drug-addled kids who consequently folded The Dead into their collective bosom. The complete absence of musicianship is precisely what made The Grateful Dead so appealing. Their songs, both unoriginal and poorly executed, were never more complex than the average Highlights crossword puzzle. Chord changes seemed more like questions than statements and guitar solos wandered in a stupefied haze lacking both point and direction. Most egregious of all was the singing which hovered somewhere between horrifying and unforgivable. But listen again, and remember that this album was recorded 40 years ago. Then consider that the Dead have toured more consistently than the Stones, shlepping their zonked-out noodles from one end of the globe to the other, jamming interminably until the cows came home - presumably in an attempt to silence them. Then play something recent by The Dead and let the penny slowly drop. The music is still horrible and they still can't sing. All that work, wasted. It's a shame. Had they invested that much energy into something for which they were suited, like repairing automatic transmissions, just think how high they might have soared
1	Psychedelic Punk You Can Dance To..It May Sound Better Now Than It Did In 1967. The fast spontaneous furious speed of this 1st album from the seminal improvisational band is nothing less than a spectacular experience far ahead of it's time. The Dead were fine musicians, always respected and paid homage to their influences by developing a unique hybrid of traditional blues and country,folk,jug and rock and roll within in a jazz setting. Creating a new form emulated by so many of their contemporaries within rock may not have been their intention, but that is a defining element of their historical importance. The sense of immediacy and existential NOW is keenly felt here. Even the few tracks clocked in at 5 minutes or higher have a primal energy to it and is danceable..The beauty of this album is that it totally debunks the notion that the Dead were a jam band only and were not capable of laying down great songs in time spans under 3 minutes.They knew how to have a good time.. This CD features so many in concert staples later stretched out into what became Dead Head music listening to it again with the extra tracks and hdcd is very refreshing. The homage paid to their wide musical roots and upping it by creating dynamic interesting music interplaying in 1967 double guitars and later a dual drum attack into some unique synthesis that is both old and new was and is a rare accomplishment.
0	The fall of Hooverphonic continues Once Hooverphonic was a great band. Their first album with the brilliant singer Liesje Sadonius was brilliant and also the second album was great with Geike singing quite good. Then came a decent third album with a couple of good moments followed bye a very dissapointing 4. album, a live album I did not want to invest in, and now this even worse album. I have heard it once, and I don't think I will ever hear it again. Not that it is horrible, but it is just not worth spending my time for, and Geike has now lost all the beauty in her voice, and now sings quite badly most of the time in my opinion. I surtenly miss Liesje Sadonius' beutiful voice in this band. Anyone knows what has happened to her? But back to the album and the conclusion. If you did like Hooverphonics first albums best, then do not buy this and be dissapointed once again. But if you did like the 4. album, you will surely also like this.
1	GREAT All the great songs you remember from Donny & Marie. Love em' ALL.
0	Look for an import Forget about this. You can get these tracks, better remastered in the Definitive or Proper labels. They got them here at Amazon. This edition is a joke
1	Excellent!!!! I love it. Christina really brought the Holiday Spirit to life in this CD. This is one of my most favorite CDs...I'm listening to it right now.
1	Another solid set. This disc will bring back some pleasant memories. Any disc with &quot;Drift Away&quot; on it is almost worth purchasing no matter what else is on it. This one just happens to have &quot;Brother Louie&quot; &quot;It Never Rains In Southern California&quot; and &quot;Stuck In The Middle With You&quot;. The sound quality is exceptional, just like any disc by Rhino
0	Good, but why buy this when there is Smiling Phases!?!?!? For a penny less, you can get every song on "Feelin's Alright" AND ELEVEN MORE SONGS from the compilation Smiling Phases. Sure, this one disc compilation contains *great music* but what shmoe would buy it when you can get more music on 2-CDs for less money???? Perhaps another reviewer can fill me in on the "logic" of buying this over Smiling Phases because I don't see it
0	Just buy Built to Spill albums instead... really an album that should be played in the background, if at all - it's slow and wandering music won't keep your attention for long and rightly so. and other reviewers are correct about the lyrics, if you're still paying attention you'll be less than impressed. i'm amazed at how many reviews can be written here with absolutely no reference to Built to Spill - a band this album really really wants to be. it's true that this album, with its guitar work and focus on an atmosphere over progression, sounds VERY VERY much like parts of the Built to Spill albums. but would i compare this album to BTS? or Death Cab? no chance. it's just got nothing to offer other than background - nothing is being created here. no novelty. the horns people talk about in other reviews are out of place and forced - like your best friend's idea you can't talk him out of. two stars seems a little harsh, but it's a gift. i can't honestly recommend people buy this album when you can get Built to Spill or Death Cab for Cutie albums which give you this and so so much more. ****UPDATE**** trust me, the Built to Spill comparison is valid. everyone should go listen to them both and i promise you'll get it
1	Swingin'! Another beautiful album by Ms. Sutton and the band. Their musicianship is a joy. The swingin', "I'm with the Band," is a lot of fun
1	DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE, MAN!!!!! look here, i knew that there was more to this band than EXPRESS YOURSELF. this cd more than satisfied that. everything on here bumps. i can do without the slow stuff, but overall, mr. wright and company DID THEY THANG!!!!! UHHHHH!!!! i love charles' voice; especially on YOUR LOVE (MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME). that stands out because it sounds like his voice was all shot and he still found something in it to deliver. if you like true blue funkiness, then get this. it is cats and bands like this that never get played on the radio, which sucks, that really bring that sausage gravy vibe. you will understand that latter once you cop this or download it
0	Electronic Noise I got this CD from a local music store and couldn't wait to listen to it. Unfortunately, there is nothing good to say about this mix. Please read the other reviews written by people who have evaluated this mix (including my other reviews) before you make your purchase on this one, and see whether you agree with their taste of music by how they have rated other mixes. You will be surprised to learn that most of the people who gave rave reviews about J.Z Alive mix are not into this type of music to begin with. I have never come across a compilation as bad as this one. Sure you can force yourself to like it, like other reviewers, but be true to yourself. This comp. did not even give me a reason to want to give it another chance. Usually there will be something, either a good track, an awesome outro/intro mix, a flow or something that pulls you to give another listen to a CD that otherwise you might think "NAAA". J.Z's Alive mix is actually dead; no emotion, no soul, no intelligence, just pure electronic noise
0	put together too quickly and it shows!!!!! First of all, let me say that i think Billy Klippert should have been the Canadian idol. Buy his album as it is far more superior to this one in every way. Now, objectively speaking, i do believe Ryan Malcolm has a nice voice in its natural range, but at times Ryan is stretching it in this album. I believe most of the songs sound the same, and truly there is just not enough variety on this album, at times i feel like im listening to elevator music. I think if the producers took alittle more time constructing this album the result wouldve been alot better. Now i do think his release single &quot;something more&quot; is catchy, nice hooks and sentimental lyrics, but unfortunately its the only gem on this album. Buy the single and forget the album. I believe Canadian idol fans should give Billy's new album a try, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
0	Too much Monkey Business Only 8 tracks and some of them real soppy..don't waste your time or money
0	This Sure Ain't "Buried In Oblivion" The new edition (vocalist Stu Block) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous, overkilled "80's power metal" screams. It just doesn't fit & it ruins the few songs w/ potential on this release, which is a far cry from the last one anyway. There's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies, further widening the gap from Oblivion. I keep listening ... hoping it'll grow on me & I'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore, nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals, but it just ain't hap'nin. Fortunately for the band tho, it would seem I'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving. I sincerely hope no one else is as disappointed as I am. These guys have so much more talent & ability than comes thru on this cd. Better luck next time fellas
1	Great follow up to an excellent debut Wonderful band out of Poland. I do have a few minor detractions to this album (as well as their last one); 1) I think with a little bit better mix and master these guys could really break very well into North America. 2) I could easily do without the opening 35-40 sec. of whispering. If the album had started right away with the beautiful a-capella that is the opening track "After", easily could've developed a much more receptive mood from the listener IMO. Highly recommended.
0	past his prime Long-time Waits fan here, with several of his albums being on my all-time favorites list. I owned this album for nearly a year, before I traded it in. It took me a while to figure out why I always wandered out of the room after a few songs and forgot about it--because it s--ks. The lyrics either are incoherent, just strung together (eg Get Behind Mule), or veer off into the cringingly sentimental (eg House Where Nobody Lives, Chocolate Jesus). The music mostly drags, when it's not downright grating. He's lost it. You can't blame him for not knowing it, I guess. But it's long past time to write him off--since Bone Machine. (The stage works Black Rider, Alice, and Blood Money, show a consistent weakness--a lack of focus lyically as well as musically, not to mention a lot of low fi recording. I had a similar experience where it took me a few years to realized why I kept skipping tracks on Black Rider--because it mostly su-ks--and treaded it.) He peaked with the Island trilogy. My personaly favorite is Frank's Wild Years. Before the far-out sound, he also produced a lot of real poetry along with his jazz-club shtick. Now his writing seems almost like senile mumbling. And his thematic concerns hvae descended/ degenerated into the likes of loving family life. Is there any chance of a renascence? (Not as yet based on a sampling of Real Gone.) All the kids who have caught onto the Waits thing need try to think a lot harder about these songs and compare them to songs on Rain Dogs and Swordfishtrombones. Back then even when the references and language were oblique, or obscure, they developed a story or an image or a sentiment. It built from line to line--developed an idea, with continuity. Now it's mostly a string of stylized cr-p, using the vocabulary he developed all his life but to no end.
0	bad BAD B-A-D I've ordered the collection with one thought in mind: ohh boy! a good irish collection. i was astonished to hear SYNTHESIZED(!) music instead of the real instruments - no violins here, no bagpipes, no flutes! only synthesized music! this collection had much potential but it was killed! not to mention the annoying rain sounds. ok - their nice for starts but they dont stop all thru the album and sometimes the music gets engulfed in them totaly. BAD
1	Only the Lord knows Probably only the Lord knows why I love this album so much. Like another reviewer, my wife and son won't let me play it while their around, so I play and sing along with it while I am alone in the car. Yes, Leon's voice is terrible to some, a little whiney to some but that is what gives the album its charm. You can hardly sing worse! The song selections are classic. The band is great. I love the steel guitars of Pete Drake, Curly Chalker, Weldon Myrick, and Hal Rugg. Then you have the classic Dobro of Tut Taylor on Uncle Pen! What more is there to love
0	Do you actually listen to music???? Firstly, how many of the people that have bought this album heard a track or two on the radio? Maybe you saw him on TV? Maybe you bought it because it's 'cool' to like this kind of music at the moment? That's right, you probably listen to any kind of music (no matter the quality) that has been forced down your throat repeatedly. James Blunt (and many other mainstream acts) represent what is wrong with the world today. Most people don't five a f**k about music when it comes down to it, and are quite happy to listen to what is paraded in front of them. I urge you (if you've read this far), to try and find music YOURSELF. Distance yourself from the media machine - you might just be suprised. As for this album: It's completely derivative, with every element done 100 times better 30 thirty years ago. James Blunt has a terrible voice - the comparisons to a cat being strangled mentioned elsewhere are accurate, although it sounds like the cat is also passing out razors. The songs are dull and predictable, the 'emotions' having been well planned out in an A+R meeting at the record company. Yet this album is extremely popular and acclaimed by many. A sad state of affairs indeed...
1	Best Hiphop album of the year This band was on the great hiphop group for the late 1980s. They pretty much did everything that was innovative fifteen years ago. Public Enemy and NWA got more attention at the time. They paved the way for other innovators like Beastie Boys and De La Soul. Ten years later they would influence The Prodigy's The Fat of The Land. Kool Keith would continue and make great records later. But this was back in the day of the fade haircut. That was the hype thing to do. Each song on this record is a hit. "Ego Trippin" is some of the hardest hitting slamming music of all time. "Traveling At The Speed Of Thought" is an example how advanced they were lyrically. Public Enemy was more political and NWA was more gangster. Ultramagnetic MCs were like poetry in a way that Tupac Shakar isn't. "Give The Drummer Some" is one of their best songs. Like Public Enemy, they were influenced by the beats of James Brown. Critical Beatdown is one of the great albums of all time. It needs to be recognized. This album also contains six extra tracks like "A Chorus Line." This is where things started. The 1980s were a harder time for hiphop to get known. This record reminds me of Mike Daley. We used to listen to hiphop and play video games.
1	spirit lifting This is a great cd, almost every song had me swaying in my seat at my computer. The tunes have a slightly meditative effect, but are still lively and funky even. Highly recommended, Krishna Lila will transport you to a far-off land of exotic colourful streets and purple sunsets
1	A Major 5 The Music here is very well Crafted.Mccoy Tyner still has that touch.Al Foster is Tight on Skins.Stanley Clarke just gets better with time.I Have Followed Mccoy Tyner's Music for a Long Long time.Nobody ever Sounds Like they once did but you hope as the Artist age that they get better with time&amp;Enhance their craft.Mccoy Tyner has been Hit&amp;Miss at times but he brings back the juice on this set.The Chemistry really works well here.You Feel The Soul&amp;Passion on The Instrumentation of These Great Musicians
1	Fantastic Album from the most underrated rock group ever! Every track from this rich, warm LP blows you away. Everything from Pete Ham's and George Harrison's slide guitars on "Day After Day" to Ham's hauntingly aching "Take It All." Every rock and pop fan should pick this CD up before it slips out of print. Badfinger initially were on the Beatles' Apple Records label before they moved to Warner Brothers in 1973/74. Every album recorded by this incredibly gifted band is worth it - "Magic Christian Music," "No Dice" (which ties with "Straight Up" as the best LP, "Ass," "Badfinger," "Wish You Were Here" and "Head First." Any fan of the Beatles, The Who, Hendrix, Cream/Clapton and everyone else from the late 1960s/early 1970s should pick up Badfinger's discs. This was the band that Rolling Stone magazine said, in 1970, is the group "to watch for" in the coming years. It's a shame their manager, S. Polly, was such a thief and robbed the band of royalties and potential fame, which concluded with Ham's suicide in 1975 and bassist Tom Evans' suicide in 1983. Drummer MIke Gibbons, sadly, passed away late last year, leaving only guitarist-vocalist Joey Molland as the band's sole survivor. Rest in peace guys! P.S. Don't be turned off by The Beatles comparisons - Badfinger had a sound, song structures and style all to their own, which will please both fans of The Beatles and those who don't care for the Fab Four. Power pop-rock was never better than the early 1970s records from Badfinger. (Actually, Badfinger's output was as good as most of the solo Beatles work in the early 1970s.
1	One of 2pac's best This is easily in the top 3 of 2pac's best cds. It is one of the best and he is still at death row
0	Sorry... My wife and I love Govi's music but am little tired that he keeps re-doing the same music over and over
1	Exellent cd by this pioneering jazz vocal group... The Boswell Sisters were the 1st group to truly use jazz in vocal harmony, there arrangements by lead singer Connie Boswell were innovative, and full of jazz syncopations and the blues. This pioneering jazz vocal group would influence and pave the way for groups as diverse as Lambert, Hendricks & Ross to todays Take 6. A great cd of great new Orleans jazz harmony vocals. The Bozzies are backed here by combos that feature such solosists as Bunny barigan, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, Jimmy & Tommy Dorsey, among others
1	Sweet!!! I think Daves latest effort is a winner. I love the "urban feel" to this CD and hope he makes more like this one. I see and hear why the single "Honey Dipped" stayed at #1 for so many months...
1	Deffinately a good start for the radio. This is the guitarist from Jonah's (yeah, yeah, yeah; Jonah's this, Jonah's that) former band Far. This is a really good footing for the radio in it's current state. I have a question though: WHEN THE HECK IS THAT QUICKSAND TRIBUTE ALBUM SUPPOSED TO COME OUT?! K; bug the heck out of this band if you ever see them and ask them about the Quicksand tribute album that was supposed to come out like 5 years ago (it was also supposed to have Ray Cappo from Youth of Today and Shelter, Chaka Malik from Burn and Orange 9mm, Glassjaw, Biohazard and a bunch of other incredibly talented people). Ta ta
0	Torch it! I am a big fan of Pattie Lupone but as a torch singer she has a long way to go to catch up to the likes of fellow singers Linda Eder and others. I was very disappointed in this CD
1	Magnificant Animal Farm is the best film score I have ever heard. It's beautiful and haunting on so many levels. The songs really convey the emotion of the film(which is really good, by the way)Beasts of the World is really reminiscent of the Communist Revolution. The Theme Storm of Judgment resonates with the hope of the animals as well the darkness of Napoleon's reign. Highly recommended
1	Perfect Throw all the Luna albums together on iPod, hit random, and any of their songs that fill one cd are a best of. I couldn't stand them until I shut up and listened two years ago
0	Message to Korn Youve all lost your minds.Please take a break.2 years or so.In this time listen to your first cd.Notice the awesome sound???The bass,the drums.Notice the singer friggin going crazy.Now when you make the next cd make sure the tone is exactly the same as the first.Exactly.Nothing different.It was perfect.Like KFC chicken!!!Also Jon,start wearing the Adidas suit again and maybe youll have a flashback and start singing with true emotion again.Also get rid of the lame Masters of the Universe mic stand!Money has destroyed yet another great band!!!!
1	A five*star* stunner I purchased the re-mastered version, and it sounds like it is live, i.e, you are there, only clearer. The songs are breathtaking, heart-breakingly lovely, and overflowing with joy, like a cool spring breeze blowing on you with the hot sun above. Sorry, Pat -- I think I broke that one getting it out.
1	Ladies In Lavender CD The film "Ladies In Lavender" is touching and a tear jerker, but, so well done. Having the film on DVD was not enough, I needed to have the CD to play when I am driving. The violin virtuosity of Joshua Bell is magnificient and so pleasing to hear when relaxation is desired
1	Sachmo - mmmmm What can I say about this CD except "mmmmm". Ya gotta love it, this CD has a range of songs that will fulfill anyones desire for some of Mr Armstrongs' special treatment. Get it, play it, love it
0	BORING Shedaisy does NOT have the staying power. In a few years everyone will be saying "Shedaisy WHO?" Their music is very forgettable!
1	Excellent, upbeat and perfect for a happy season! This is the happiest, most upbeat Christmas music I've ever heard. It'll bring a smile to your face instantly
1	He has evolved The fact remains that everyone wants a Jonny Lang cd that sounds like every other Jonny Lang CD. He is amazing. Noone could believe that such a young guy could have such a soulful voice. His soulfullness has not changed just the main sound of it. This CD provided me with the satisfaction to see how versitile his music can be and I was VERY pleasantly suprised. I recommend this cd to any Jonny fan because he has proved that he is an ever evolving music artist. Amazing
0	Jonny, what have you done to yourself? This disc is a huge disappointment! What happened to the young blues guitar slinger I really liked? He has completely changed his style and I was hoping we finally had a new blues musician that would grow and grow into a blues great! This in not blues at all. I suspect his producers at A&M thought they saw someone to make money from, but this is eclectic garbage although his voice is still great. Go back to what you do best Jonny - blues.
1	Bigger than the Hit Parade Listening to an album like this makes you despise the record industry and the way that fashions and slavish conformity dictate success. The Buffalo Skinners was released in 1993, two years after Big Country had been callously and stupidly dropped by Phonogram. They then produced this astounding masterpiece, in which every track is solid and some "Pink Marshmallow Moon," "Alone," etc. - are sheer classics. Of course, gurning teenagers with grungey guitars were all the rage at the time, so the craftsmanship and quality of this earnest and soulfull collection of songs went largely unrecognised. Big Country created a sound that could fill not only stadiums and arenas but also the vast landscapes of their native and their adopted land.
1	Must have! This amazingly beautiful album to me is the soundtrack of Anatolia, of an era gone by when Turks, Greeks, Armenians and other ethnic groups shared their lives peacefully and harmoniously. Its sadness inevitably reminds me of millions who unnecessarily died on this soil in many wars fought in early twentieth century, of people forced to leave the only land the knew for unknown destinations and destinies, of the unimaginable hardships endured by its people. And more personally it takes me fom New York and puts me right next to my father's grave in a forgotten Anatolian village, 6000 miles away
0	Shocked I am shocked. I would have at least thought that the beats on Shock Value were going to be good (to make up for the fact that Timbaland can't rap to save his life). Even Timbaland talks about how much money he makes for beats in his "hit track" with Nelly Furtado and JT. It's too bad that he sold all his hot beats to other artists and didn't keep any for himself. One thing that he isn't is better than Scott Storch. Keep dreaming Timbaland. You are nothing more than a wanna-be Lil' John looping your 'yeah's and 'oooooh's in every track that sounds the same as the one before.
1	Good Album Lily Allen mixes hip-hop with a pop sound. She's got catchy, easy to listen to music
1	Digging Lily When i first saw lily on these 15 minute mtv skits in the morning i knew i had to look her up. Thank god i did!!! I love her music! Lily gives off this i don't care i'm me vibe and she speaks from the heart. The album is amazing!! Best songs: Smile LDN Littlest things Nan your a window shopper

0	Antichrist super-ripoff Alright, here goes the first intelligent low rating this album has recieved. No I'm not some christian preaching to you, I'm actually a fan of manson. I think the lyrics on this album are pretty good, but mediocre music. My main problem with this album is the fact that it is a total rip-off of david bowie. Let's look at the man himself. Manson wears contacts to make it look like he has two different colored eyes, while bowie actually has two different eyes. With Ziggy Stardust, Bowie's image became androgynous, just as manson's always has been. Now let's look at the actual albums of Ziggy and Antichrist. They both tell the story of a self-destructive unearthly rock and roll superstar. Manson's shock rock symbol even bears a strong resemblance to the Ziggy Lightning bolt. And this all comes from a man constantly preaching individualiry, while making an idol of himself, and slamming other artists for ripping him off. And then he put out mechanical animals, an exact replica of ziggy stardust, and ironically enough it's what made him truly famous. I just think it's a little hypocritical. Check out Holy Wood. It is much better lyrically and musically, and far more original. The other thing that really pisses me off is the vocal department. A lot of fans are saying his voice is underated, but i hate to say, he really can't sing. Watch the guns god and government tour and see how he really sounds. All he's basically good for are his writing skills..
1	Desmond's creative period Paul Desmond is well known and broadly admired for his bell-like sound (tone), but this set of recordings well demonstrates the inventive quality of his earlier sesions. His interaction with Mulligan in this piano-free quartet environment brings out the chromatics that might be missed in the Brubeck era recordings. Among his really best.
1	My newest obsession I'm not particularly interested in Punk music, I prefer roots/americana/folk and on the other hand 70's and 80's rock music. I, like so many others, heard Dropkick's song on "The Departed" and it's gripping sound drew me in to purchase the album. I am now 100% certain that I will sooner or later end up with every album in their catalog. To tell you the truth, I've abandoned the other 1,000 songs on my iPod for 13 of the 14 tracks on this album. The songs are anthem-like, brawl-inspiring, rugby-esque. Music that goes well with a side of raw meat. I am glad I bought this album before the earlier ones, it's mature and established sound helped hook me. I can't wait (now) to get into the grittier earlier tunes
1	Perfect for Meditation and Yoga I'd have to disagree with the review that called this &quot;new age kitchenette music&quot;. I find it difficult to meditate to music that has a lot of polarity to it or forces me to listen to it instead of listening to my inner self. The songs flow together. It may seem repetitious at times, but the songs are subtly individualistic. This group is anything but 'Americanized'. They're a great blend of Indian, Arab and African flavor with a dash of Celtic. The music also is the ideal pace for yoga as well, yet soft enough even to sleep to
0	elevator music i agree, if you don't want to waste postage mailing this cd set back don't waste your time. wasn't even the original songs you would normally hear on the oldies radio stations
0	I agree, don't bother MADACY, the company that makes this CD box set, does not include the original songs, but remakes. I bought this set because it was was cheap. Cheap is exactly what I got. Try the &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; series.
1	Cry Of Love Back in the 70's I wore out my vinyl copy of Hendrix's Cry Of Love Album. Songs like, Drifting and My Friend have been floating around in my head for all these years and I had tried to find a copy of CRY Of Love on cd several times with no luck. Well, here it is under a different name and with some additional songs ! These are some of the best cuts Jimi Hendrix ever recorded and the music sounds as good today as it did when I was a kid. Absolutely great stuff.
1	LA CHAT is RaW My opinion is: La chat is a tyte raw female rapper, with 3 six adding her to the camp, she brings the murder murder. I have to say she is much much more leathal then Gangsta Boo. This is a must buy cd if your a tru Triple six fan
1	Instant Favorite Although it only has a few selections by Evans, this interview gives some real insight into his approach and thought process. Recorded only two years before his untimely death in 1980, it shows the mature performer at the top of his game
0	What's so freakin' great about this? I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department. As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average. It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked. Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia. Want real 80's metal (not glam)? Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others
0	Not for my son! My mother-in-law bought this soundtrack for my son who is 4 years old. We trusted that since this was a Disney/Pixar movie that the sound track would be appropriate for kids as the movie is geared towards children. However, there is a song on there by Chingy (who I not heard of until we heard this soundtrack) that is VERY sexualy suggestive. Here is one verse from the song. I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (fine) Lil momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime) The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (grind) I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked) I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (back) I like it when I touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal I swooped on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its prey I know you popular, but you gon' be famous today I am appalled that such a song would be on this soundtrack. If your children are older and you don't mind this kind of music I would recommend this CD as the rest of the songs are really good. However if your children are young and you don't wish for them to be exposed to this type of song I would STRONGLY NOT recommend this CD
1	Mark O'Connor Plays Everything This is a terrific showcase for O'Connor's remarkable prowess on the fiddle as he moves flawlessly from one style to the next, cajun, bluegrass, old-time, he tackles it all while surrounding himself with some of the best country musicians I have ever heard such as steel guitar player Paul Franklin and piano player Matt Rollins. Mostly these are up-tempo instrumental tracks but there are also a few vocal tracks included. If you want to hear musicians playing for musicians, this is a great CD
0	credit where credit is due this is not a review of this compilation, but please note, CSNY fans, that while their version of "Woodstock" may be the more familiar one, the song was written by Joni Mitchell. Listen to her own (comletely different) performance of it on her "Ladies of the Canyon" (1970) album
0	bad honestly, i think this is horrible nothing catchy or good about it..all the songs sound the same just nothing syticks out...there last cd was the same thing but a little better. if your gonna buy one bleeding through cd i recommend portrait of the goddess...stay away from thi
1	Vintage Rodney &quot;What's in a Name&quot; is a perfect taste of Rodney's early years in the nightclub scene. You can even hear glasses hitting glasses and other various club noises in the background. He's a little toned down, but you still get tons of his trademark &quot;I Don't Get No Respect&quot; jokes. If you want to hear some of Rodney's greatest jokes before they were really famous and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the CD for you. I'm really happy my friend, Kevin McCarthy bought it for me
1	Incredible There is no doubt in my mind that this is the finest recording of Handel's Messiah available. As said before by other reviewers, the voices are very clean, unlike some renditions that sound like they are performing a Wagnerian Opera. These are definitely some of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard (Bravo especially to the tenor). Diction is excellent. The sound quality is very good, and it is on period instruments. This is one of my favorite sets. Very highly recommended. However, I had some trouble obtaining a copy of this recording, and there is a possibility that it has gone out of print, so hurry
0	Nothing compared to his first album. Mack 10 couldn't do it twice. His first album is tight, but this one lacks good beats. Also, his rapping style is too lame to carry the off beats. The only way could have saved the album is if he would have had alot of guest rappers and producers
1	Excellent! A great selection of Italo-Dance songs with some other good songs as the upper tracks. Overall a wonderful CD
0	Melodious Madeliene, Magnificent! I love her relaxed phrasing and the tone and easy flow of her vocal
1	jumpin' And when I say jumpin', I mean what I'm doing in my kitchen while this CD is playing. I've seen the show twice, and it's like a drug that I just want again and again. But this is the next best thing. The show is so good, but the music creates such images in my mind that I don't miss it as much. My kids dance to it with me and my wife, and we all just groove to the beat. I can't help but think that BMG reminds methat I live in a cyberpunk novel, and the music gives me a soundtrack for the day. I love this
1	One Sexy CD I'm loving the CD. They have a great sound....sensuous and chill. I first heard their music on a compilation CD. They play some of their tracks on Nip/Tuck too.
0	Disappointing... ...and i'm a Charlap fan. High hopes. But this recording, though given star treatment/art department/high gloss packaging with liner notes by playwright John Guare, is listless and uninspiring. Yes, nicely arranged and all that, but airless. It never breathes; it rarely swings...A couple new chord interpolations, one tempo surprise, one or two harmonic sparks -- way too few and far between to recommend. Pastel. Pleasant. But miles from jazz. If you want to hear Bernstein songs in a &quot;nice&quot; piano trio format with few challenging ideas, this is for you. Bill Evans is the standard for &quot;Lucky To Be Me&quot; and &quot;Some Other Time.&quot; Oscar Peterson / Andre Previn for the &quot;West Side&quot; soundtrack. Much promise goes unfulfilled here..
1	great!! Nice to finally have a compilation of hits from the greatest female rapper EVER! Beware it is explicit
1	The Comprehensive Lenny Bruce Finally! the boxed set we've all been waiting for. Lenny Bruce was, no question about it, the greatest stand-up comic of all time. He stood alone and unafraid, holding up a mirror to the face of a sick, hypocrtical society that didn't like what was reflected. For this he payed the ultimate price. I'm not 100 percent crazy about this collection. For the Lenny Bruce collector there will be disappointments in light of the fact that some of the material has been released before. The booklet that comes with it also contains some eye-popping errors of fact. Still, it has alot of pleasant surprises and I reccomend it to anyone who is discovering the genius of Lenny Bruce for the first time. He once said, "People should be taught what is, not what should be. All my humor is based on destruction and despair and tomorrow, if the world became tranquil without disease or violence, I'd be standing on the breadline - right behind J. Edgar Hoover and Jonah Salk" He spoke to us then; He speaks to us still. Tom Degan Goshen, NY
1	highly enjoyable I am not a big Tesla fan but this is a great album. I think what hurt them is that they were categorized with the all the goofy hair metal bands but they were more in the vein of your classic 70's style rock and roll band. This live album, along with the accoustic format, helped to distinguish Tesla from the hair metal bands of the era. Tesla did not do much after this cd so this acts as an excellent greatest hits compilation as well. Besides their own work, the covers are good and interesting selections. They do not just play "Truckin", rather they segue into it. "Lodi" is done very well and then the song that essentially launched the cd, as well as the band, is "Signs". They take this marginal 60's era protest song and put their stamp of it. It still maintains a protest aura to it but the accoustic treatment makes it grittier and it rocks out harder. Tesla made the song their own! As far as the accoustic format, the song "Love Song" showcases the musicianship of the band. I like how they could not resist plugging in for the guitar solo. Overall, you do not have to be a fan of this band to enjoy this cd. If you like any classic rock Led Zep, CCR, Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, Aerosmith etc. then you will like this. Like I said, I am not a big fan but b/c of this cd, I would see them live any day!
0	This is why one should never use drugs... ...it gives one delusions of grandeur, a sense that any piece of garbage that comes out of one's mouth is a work of genius. Pure ego. Pretention. Stupidity. Megalomania. Don't blame them so much -- blame us, we who actually bought anything Lennon and the Beatles put out. Now, John came out with his BEST solo album Plastic Ono Band soon after this so it's not John's lack of talent. This is what happens when Cupid strikes you blind...and deaf. Don't even think of buying this. I suppose the only good thing about is hearing the heartbeat of an unborn child and realizing that it is, after all, not a glob of tissues but a baby. So maybe there is some significant "countercultural" message in it, after all
1	Ageless and Beautiful Music It's hard for me to believe that nearly 10 years have passed since this album was released. Maire Brennan, lead vocalist of Clannad, has a voice that is both ethereal and powerful at the same time. She has the ability to move me to tears even while singing in a language of which I have only minimal understanding (Irish gaelic). This particular album has several pieces that are quite beautiful and relaxing ... they would work nicely as lullabies. Brennan's skill as a harpist is also shown to great advantage on many tracks. Not to be missed if you are an admirer of Celtic New Age music
1	Can YOU dig it? Iron Butterfly...definately different. There are not too many if any albums with this sound. I used to have this on wax and wanted it on CD now. Great for rap producers if you are creative with samples. True music fans will enjoy
1	Order from Amazon.com directly instead. In the past years I have ordered from individuals via Amazon as opposed to Amazon.com directly. This time, this particular item was offered through Amazon at basically the same cost and I received the item faster than I ever had before. From now on if Amazon offers any item I wish to purchase, I'll order it through Amazon directly.
0	Borrrrrring I feel compelled to add my review, as I bought this CD based on what I'd read here... what a disappointment. Tedious, predictable, unimaginative "electro-pop". There's SO much more interesting stuff out there, and I listen to alot. I found this CD remarkably disposable. No offense..
0	A big let down! I bought this CD a while back and it was a complete let down from what I thought it would be. The commercials made it look so good and made it sound really good. The commercials depicted at least 45 seconds of good music from the CD, and that is about all I found. On both CDs combined there are like 2 songs that are OK. I bought the CD, walked out to my car, popped it in, and listened. An hour later I got out of my car and took the CD back(or tried to really). Now the only thing I use the CD for is to watch the little movie clip of the HOT girl on the second CD. All in all, a big let down
1	good music even if I didn't understand the language. I am not sure if this is the same cd/album that I heard about 10 years ago. Most often as time goes by an artist will improve with age, getting better as time goes on, learning from beginning mistakes etc. So from this generalization, I believe that he has gotten better. Plan to order this soon
1	Finally one as good as their first I thought that Kutless was getting a little lax in their songwriting skills after "Sea of Faces". This CD shows they've regained their focus on their music. A must-buy for you Kutless fans!!
0	The reason why shred is dead When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album. Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff. Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding. The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.
1	The Classic Quartet Throughout Coltrane's prolific recording career he performed with many great musicians. One glance at his discography can affirm this fact and this disc features, arguably, his best surrounding musicians; they have become known as simply The Classic Quartet. The featured aartists are Jimmy Garrison on bass, McCoy Tyner on piano, Elvin Jones on drums and JC on saxophone(s). If you are a collector of Coltrane music this is a must have disc since it features his classic quartet in fine form. This is a late seminal recording from around the time of Tranes album &quot;Ascension.&quot; The title track, &quot;Living Space&quot; is a profound piece and an inspirational piece of artistry that is emotionally stirring . Trane is featured playing in his innovative modal mode that was influenced from the timelessness of Eastern Indian music. Since this was a posthumous release there are several tracks that were found that are untitled having only vault numbers. Do not let this put you off since they are some of finest songs on the disc but not having a name to associate with the melody is a bit challenging for the listener. Trane is at his improvisational best, reaching both vertically and horizontally on his sound, overlapping and interweaving with staggering results. The importance of the classic quartet to the totality of the sound cannot be overly emphasized; it was a combustible union that created magic that has lasted for generations. Mccoy Tyner played with a bouyancy that allowed for the shifting of sound in directions that were held together by the driving drums and pounding of the skins by Elvin Jones. This coupled with the thumping, harmonic bass of Jimmy Garrison created the one of tightest groups ever assemled in the annals of jazz history.This disc shows the fluidity of the players, each part contributing to the whole for a sound that has yet to be duplicated.Trane is bluesy, melodic, at times he plays in a far reaching, writhing style, but eventually the tenderness returns for the warm lush sound that only he has been able to produce. His ceaseless explorations on the saxophone, exemplified by his quest for a muscial spirtitual search comes through on this fine collection of recordings. Pieces of &quot;A Love Supreme &quot; and fragments of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; can be heard echoing through the solos of Trane as he explores his inner sanctity revealing his consciousness. This is definitely a disc for the Coltrane or jazz connoisseur that features some of the last recrdings of the Classic Quartet. An excellent recording by some of the best at their collective apogee
1	auwsome I just ordered this CD and can not wait to get it I have listened to all of the samples and there is not one song that i do not like I believe this guy is going to go very far. I love is song good morning beautiful. I have always been a very big fan of Vince Gill now this guy is rating right up there with Vince!!!!!!!!!!! so thanks for comming to the country scene your going to go very far
0	Where Is &quot;Love Is Alive?&quot; I agree this is not up to par with Joe's best stuff from the 60s and early 70s, but given that, they even left off his best song from this period, &quot;Love Is Alive.&quot; That song really ROCKS and it is not here. Shame
1	Sam "Sam" stands alone this time... I've enjoyed all the Winter Solstice collections except the "Winter Solstice on Ice" - now, that's atrocious! No. III is one of my favorites because of the vocals. The version of "In the Bleak Midwinter" is one of the most purely spiritual carols I've ever heard. In fact I'm buying my second copy of this CD today because my first has disappeared
0	Just more schtick I'm getting kind of over the same old schtick all the time. WHy is it that Jews always self depricate? God knows, the Christians never do that. They're very proud all the time. Jews seem to come off "silly" and sophomoric. I suppose this compilation is pretty comprehensive as far as artists, but it sure would be nice if someone put an album together that had a little more heart to it
1	last track: What I Like About Jew For a more modern take on funny Jewish songs, check out What I Like About Jew's CD, titled Unorthodox , also for sale on Amazon. Sarcastic, hilarious, two very talented New York boys.
1	Excellent Soundtrack This is an excellent soundtrack. PMG show another side of their musical journey with a more atmoshperic and emotionnal journey. If only every soundtrack were this good. One big surprise that I encountered while listenign to this album is the lack of solos, but this lack works really well, the atmosphere is what sings to you on this album unlike previous Metheny albums. Reccomended to fans of atmospheric and laid-back music. If you're debating on this purchase, buy it right away, you will not regret
1	WOW! I've heard Breeze On By on the radio but I never listened to who the artist was. This is a great CD - relaxing & romantic music. Donny still has such a beautiful voice. BUY this CD - you will not be disappointed in any of the tracks
1	The Best Collection Of 70's Music Out There--Hands Down Instead of giving an individual review of each volume in this series, I decided to give one review on the final volume of the series. As a child in the 70s I grew up hearing these songs on the radio and the entire series really gave me a feeling of nostalgia. When I started collecting this series, I didn't always know each artist or even each song title, but once I spun the disc, the lyrics to these songs came back from the dark void of my memory. That was half the fun of this whole series. Volume 13 was the one volume in the entire series that I remebered each song. Volumes 12, 13, 14 and 15 are my favorite volumes. Not each volume is a winner. Volumes 4, and 6 I felt weren't that great of volumes, but each volume contains at least 4-5 great gems. Again, the entire series is great. This series and Rhino's Didn't It Blow Your Mind series are hands down the best series of 70's music out there. I give both series five stars. If there was one thing that I felt that Rhino missed on these was that they didn't take each series out to five more volumes. The would have given Have A Nice Day 30 volumes and Didn't It Blow Your Mind 25 volumes. Either way, the Have A Nice Day series is my favorite 70s music complilation series and it has gotten lots of use in my CD player. If you like quirky AM pop from the 70s, then this series is for you. You won't regret it. If your looking for more of the FM style 70s music, then get Time/Lifes Sound of the 70s. After reading several reviews for the various volumes in this series, it's clear the some people missed the entire point of this series. This entire series was supposed to resemble or be a throw back to those infamous compilation LPs from K-Tel that were everywhere in the 70s. This series wasn't supposed to have great songs. Just memorable ones.
0	Heartbroken more like it... A patched up Free attempts to carry on as normal, but the chemistry is just not there - Fraser is gone and Tetsu struggles / doesn't even try to make the most of the opportunity given to him. Rather than contribute some great bass ideas, he is content just to plod along; Kossoff plays on 5 of the 8 tracks. Gone is the heart wrenching melody and beautiful vibrato of his playing. He's running on remote control. It sounds like he's slumped in the corner of the studio stoned out of his head; Bundrick writes 2 tracks / shares the credits on two others. His work sounds like album filler put there to satisfy the band's contractual requirements. The whole album is Lazarus with a triple bypass. The only standout track is the EXCELLENT 'Wishing Well'... the other songs are just musical ideas i.e verse and chorus cobbled into a finished song... another album to buy if you can't stand blank spaces in your Free CD collection... What a tragic waste...
0	Galactic Falls Flat This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois
0	Oh my god, it has taken Patrick Doyle! By "it" I mean the evil monster called "Repetition". It may sound like a strange thing to say, but if you already own Doyle's "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire", there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this soundtrack. The film feels like you've seen it a thousand times already, and so does the score. I can't stress enough how much I dislike the habit of many composers to develop a specific sound and a certain set of themes and motifs, and ride them out until the end of days. That being said, it's not a big reach saying that Goblet Of Fire and Eragon sound exactly the same. And they do. The orchestrations couldn't be more identical, and the theme is the same, even if Doyle adds a few flourishes. It may fit the film somehow, but if you forget that for a second and evaluate the music as an entry in the long history book of film music, or even in the not-so-long book of the last few years, or worse, as a standalone piece, it's just a horrible product, it's Patrick Doyle on autopilot. And even if it does fit the film, there's more to a great film score than capturing a scene reasonably well. A great film score gives the film a unique feeling, and Eragon doesn't do that. Instead of writing an "Eragon" score, Doyle churned out a Patrick Doyle score. Sound crazy, but that's the big difference between good film composers and great film composers. And contrary to the opinion of many, Doyle is merely a good composer, and so we get a Doyle score with Eragon fingerprints instead of Eragon music with Patrick Doyle fingerprints.
1	Great Jazz Introduction!!! First let me tell you, when I got this cd the only other Jazz I had listened to was Miles Davis and that "West Coast/Cool" style. This Cd opened me up to so much more. I was searching for a cd just of this type that really showcased all the different elements and styles of jazz. While most of this is the vocal type of Jazz(Bille Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald...) there are the instrumental types of jazz, which up in till this cd I thought was the only type of jazz. This really opened me up to the Vocal side of jazz, like I may have mentioned before when I purchased this I was a Jazz novice, I had heard Billie Holiday and the like on the radio and Tv/Movies(most of the songs on the cd you will reconize) but never really listened to them. Now I find myself listening to Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong more then any other music(and I listen to a lot of music). I also found a new favorite song of mine, Summertime by Ella and Louis. I think most of these songs can be found on other cd's so if you already own these artist cd's then you may want to check and see if you don't already own these songs. But if you are new to Jazz like I was, then get this great compilation to start with. Peace Kevi
1	Modern Day Blues Classic This is one of the finest blues albums to be produced in the past 25 years. Right off the bat from the blistering 'Testify' to the classic 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' to the closing jazz influenced 'Lenny' you know this album is going to be something special. SRV & TD are found here as a trio and you would be hard pressed to find a tighter band. This album is a little more striped down and more bluesy then SRV latter works. This and 'In Sessions' with Albert King are probably Stevie's best blues albums
1	Excellent, legendary show except for Donna the Screech Owl I remember taping this one from the radio on the night that it happened. The Keith & Donna years were a high point for The Dead, but I never really embraced the Donna part of the deal. Here's my challenge to you: listen to "Playing In The Band," and when you get to the point where Donna lets out that prolonged, off-key screech, let me know how that works for you. Donna, in my opinion, was this band's Yoko, except for the fact that Yoko was a better singer. She sort of wandered back and forth across the stage in her white hospital gown and at inappropriate moments let out howls and moans tuneless bursts of God-knows-what-she-was-thinking. Dead Heads have all kinds of reasons why she was a wonderful addition to the band, and I never understood or agreed with any of them. That said, it's a classic and solid set from the band, including Wharf Rat, Help On The Way, Slipknot, Morning Dew and many standards from the 70s era Dead shows. Without Donna, this would be an easy 5-star performance.
0	Shakira Is Terrible I think Shakira sucks a lot. She can't sing. I don't understand her musical appeal
0	Big disappointment I've loved some of Shakira's previous songs, and when I heard "Hips Don't Lie", and the fabulous "Don't Bother" (I LOVE those lyrics), I just had to get the album. I put it off for a while, but saw it at a semi-reasonable price, and bought it. My oh my. It isn't good!!! The only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks. I listened it to it twice. Normally I can love an album on first listen, very rarely will I get bored of it on a second listen. Nope, not with this one. Shakira has a lovely voice, but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as "Hips Don't Lie" and "Don't Bother". Don't bother buying this album unless you are a true, die hard fan of Shakira. Don't waste your money
1	Soul If any country and western singer has soul and depth in his music, it's Buddy Jewell. Smooth and emotionally connecting to all country fans. I believe he is the best new c&amp;w artist in ages and has no where to go but to the top. I highly recommend this album as fantastic
1	Heavy stuff This is one awesome CD. I bought the Oncoming Storm before this one and I prefer The Stings of Conscience. This CD just plain rocks, heavy. Sweet for head banging, the guitars amaze me, drumming super fast, screaming is solid throughout and nothing is wrong with this CD. Perfect 5 stars. All metalheads must buy this. Fav songs: One Step Away, Stings of Conscience, My Desire. So just buy it already, and get ready to be annihilated
0	Sonic Youth loses their way I remember when this album came out. I had been a huge Sonic Youth fan for years and I ran to Mod Lang in Berkeley to buy it the day it was released. I brought it home, put it on, and desperately tried to like it. But I just couldn't. SY had always had a penchant for strectching out their feedback experiments into sprawling, fasinating compositions, but here it all just seemed to melt down into a pointless noise crusade. There are a few high points, but mostly I just find myself thinking, "there is no way this song deserves to be nine minutes long." The slide continued on the next record, but fortunately they got it together again on "Murry Street" and have been putting out great stuff ever since.
1	IS THERE NO END TO DUKE'S CREATIVITY? Miles Davis once said every one ought to get down on their knees and thank Duke, after listening to this album you'll see why. I am big fan of Duke and the amazing creativity displayed in this album is awesome. There is no bebop, avant guarde, free jazz present just straight ahead swinging crafted beautiful music. The playing is exemplary and does successfully what it set out to do, provide interpretations of Shakespeare characters and plays. The genius of the man is such that this music can be listened to without references to the Bard's work and is awesome in ever aspect. Melodic , interpetative, improvisational jazz at its best, my only 'problem' is I can't decide which track I like best so I am forced to listen to the music again and again and again and... OH WELL :-) Buy this album you won't regret. If music be the food of love PLAY (SWING) ON Ellington PLAY ON. Sound familar?? Enjo
0	overrated totally overrated. felt compelled to write a review because everyone else proclaims this release is perfection and the mix of the year. disc one is strong and on for the first 4 tracks and then becomes totally monotinous and dull until the closing track which is superb. disc two doesn't move me at all except for its classic intro with orbital. If you are looking for good stuff for your crate seek out the aforementioned on 12" and don't waste your time buying this.
1	An Utter Beauty Gawd, I hope this isn't a forgotten recording. This is Oregon at their early best: unselfconsciousness; innocence; no formula, no regard for sales - just love of musical communication on the most intimate scale. They understood the value of silence and patience. And Witchi-Tai To ALONE is worth buying this recording for - it, like precious few recordings, brings tears to my eyes and makes me glad to be alive and have ears
0	Never received material You shipped it to the wrong address and I never received it!!!
0	Dull music for elderly people, why the 5 stars? I bought this album because I love Charlie Haden's tone, and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist Miguel Zenon and pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the credits. But why were they hired? There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band. I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD. The track I picked at random was nice, but I couldn't face a second, and played a Fall record instead to wake me up. I shall try again, but it seems a bit dreary.
1	Can we have a remaster? Of course this is a fine collection. Of course Dizzy's big band in the forties made some fantastic music. Of course this is an indispensible part of jazz history. But oh, the sound... Previous issues of this music on both CD and vinyl far surpass this one in terms of sound quality. The dreaded nineties-era noise reduction technology is all over this music, taking great hunks of sonic elements away from these vital performances. Since Bluebird corrected similar problems by issuing the Blanton/Webster sides by Duke Ellington, should they not do the same for these great records
0	Seldom have I been this disappointed I have at least half of these Armstrong 78s in my collection, and they are master pressings, not dubs. When played with a proper sized needle and equalized properly as well, they sound many times better than the tracks presented here. This collection is an inconsistent sonic mess. The timbre of the songs changes from track to track, some of the speeds are wrong, the volume levels are all over the place, and the overall listening experience is brash and painful. I don't worry so much about surface noise, and this collection has plenty. But a bigger issue is the way the music has been EQ'd --- in many cases an unnatural bass boost that makes the bottom end sound boxy and muddy, and which consequently makes the already-hyped highs sound even thinner and brasher by comparison. There was obviously no attempt made to properly compensate for the turnover frequencies of the original records, and it's a BIG problem for me. The collection sounds like many contributors sent in material transferred/remastered 'their own way' and the result was just thrown together as a finished product. I was very, very, very disappointed; and feel that the inflated purchase price is not justified. The hard bound book is nice, but is mostly filled with fancy, decoratively framed pictures and montages; very little real reading. Also, after 2 or 3 'readings', pages began to detach. Extremely cheap manufacture. The CDs had glue all over them, which I had to clean off before they would even play. There is mention in the notes about 'unauthorized' reissues done previously; I assume they are referring to the John R. T. Davies version on British label JSP, which is sonically FAR superior to this set, and by the way, legal according to European copyright law. Well, if Columbia Legacy could learn how to put out a decent product, people would buy it, and they wouldn't have to present Mr. Davies' excellent work as suspect. Don't waste your money on this one
1	best starland vocal band cd to date just awesome Starland vocal band cd is just awesome it will blow you away. The harmies they have couldnt better even if you try there awesome vocal talent together is just awesome. a must buy Cd today. George bretzlaf
1	Geek Rock There haven't really been many acts these past few years that really have been more about image than the feeling or uniqueness of great pop music. One of the most surprising acts these past few years is definitely Weezer. They have really brought up a great deal with the feel of geek rock, and their latest single really does connect with everybody. Their latest track Beverly Hills is a great pop song. It is very upbeat and easily catchy. I like this song because it is very different and very vivid. Rivers Cuomo and company have really got a lot into good music right now. Hopefully, they can keep it up with their next single. Song: B 1/2+
0	i call it ..." EL' CRAPPEO!!!" should bbe 000 stars weezer stinks. im sooo glad i didnt buy this cd. its horrible. my friend has it. that beverly hills song, is sooo dumb. he thinks hes all cool and skater and punk singing it. he sounds emo, and i hate emo. i hope you agree with me
1	Maybe the best Gangsta rap album ever... Say what you will about the obvious choices of "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle", my choice will always be Music to Driveby. This album exemplifies what not only great Gangsta rap should sound like but what good hip-hop should sound like as well. First and foremost, Eiht is an emcee, not just a rapper. This performance is the pinacle of his rhyme ability before he became known to the public as "the guy who says geeyah". He battles ("Dead Men Tell No Lies", "Duck Sick II", "Def Wish II", and "Who's ****ing Who?"), he paints big lyrical hood murals ("Hood Took Me Under" & "Jack Mode"), he constantly reps his hood ("Compton 4 Life"), experiments ("N*ggaz Strugglin" & "U's a B*tch"), and destroys with rapid fire delivery ("Hit the Floor"). He may be the only artist to ever hold his own on a track with the great Brad Jordan a.k.a. Scarface ("N 2 Deep"). Production is cutting edge as well and again. After the slightly uninspired Staight Checkn'em album, this album returns to the original formula that made It's a Compton Thang so great - creative use of samples. "Hood Done Took Me Under" is the classic example. Eiht rips the Isaac Hayes sample used by Easy Mo B for Notorious BIG a few years later for "Warning", and a good decade before Ludacris used it again on his "Chicken & Beer" album. To top it all off, the loop was vastly superior to either of these uses or numerous others. Or better yet, check the clever use of scratches and snippets on "Who's ****ing Who?" where Tim Dog's voice is used to scorch himself. The complete bastardization of BDP's classic "South Bronx" was even a bold manuver with, to my surprise, absolutely no response from Krs-ONE. And to wrap it all up, you get the smooth instrumental "Music To Driveby" to round it all out. Yeah sure, Eiht didn't get the national recognition until We Come Strapped a few years later. But that album, in my opinon, pales in comparison to the overuse of the same production used on Driveby's "Hood Rat" and waaaaaaay to many "Geeyah's". Driveby's way more diverse in both production and lyrics and does not suffer from any overused topics that Eiht would later be forced to employ from the overabundance of other Gangsta rappers and their albums. If you're even a mild fan of gangsta rap or even hip hop in general, do yourself a favor and pick up this classic
1	Best I've Heard I purchased several swing collections previously and they all had poor quality audio - they had not been cleaned up from the original recordings. This CD is MUCH cleaner and makes for an enjoyable experience
0	Brainless Beethoven devaluation What do you get when you play brilliant music through a bad synthesizer? Buy this CD and find out. Your little prodigy's intellect will be engulfed in an annoying stream of cheap rinky-tink pianos, tooting synth-horns, and fake accordions. This is a cheap and annoying version of a great composer's work. Your young Einstein would be better off with a cheap harmonica
1	Evil Is A Spirit I was alone and in the dark when horror seeped from my speakers into my imagination. At the end of a long metal corridor is Sunn O))), a large dark orb of pain, hate and the fear of every paralyzing dream. Its core spins violently like a tempest of knives but its movement toward me is slow, deliberate & inevitablelike the Ocean or Time or God Himself... Evil in metal is increasingly difficult to represent convincingly. Sunn O))) remind us that evil is not tangible, its corporal. Its not a flesh eating pit fiend or something pictured on a Dio cover. Evil is a Spirit and as a spirit is something bigger than our comprehension, and thus, our ability to stop it. Therein lies its terror. There is no escape or defense from an omnipotent foe; one not bound by physics like life in a tangible form. As such, Sunn O))) do not create Dungeons & Dragons heavy metal. Its closer to ambient music using minor keys and the sustain on a downtuned bass instead of marimbas and wind chimes. It owes as much to Terry Riley as Toni Iommi. Verbs like "lumber" and "plod" used for past doom acts don't apply here either. Sunn O))) hover, glide or even wisp. Omnipresent yet invisible, you'd be no more sure it was there if you could see it. Black One is truely terrifying music. It is quite possibly my most terrifying experience ever observing art. It's reward is profound if you have the...Spirit for it
1	Peter and the Wolf I gave this to my grandson, who loves the music of Peter and the Wolf. He is 2 years old, and from what his mother says, he loves it
1	Great for Kids and Adults My 3 yr old got this for Christmas and absolutely loves it. We dance to it all the time. I went to workout the other day to find it was in player instead of my normal workout CD...and already into my workout decided to keep going. It was GREAT to workout to. Very energetic like the show and good for variety in my workout. I may have to get a second one for me!
1	I can't believe it! A new Free Design CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The music of the Free Design was a part of the fabric of my life in the late 60's/early 70's. The intricate harmonies and intimate feelings shared by this family somehow cut through the psychedelic pomposities of the time and did what my favorite music always does: IT MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT! To possess a new CD by the FD in the new millenium is nothing short of a miracle. The sound is unchanged: the layered vocals, the floating interjections of flute and recorder, the challenging compositions of Chris Dedrick are all intact. Missing in action is the beguiling voice of Ellen, although co-producer Rebecca Pellet deputizes well for her. Bruce's pipes are a bit rustier than before, but Chris' delight in recollaborating with his brother is evident. It's so grand to hear music this honest, without a hint of gadgetry or synthesizer. Track 7, &quot;The Hook&quot;, makes a sly dig at the triumph of machine over man in today's pop scene.......it's the &quot;cute&quot; tune of the set. Standout songs include the title tune and &quot;McCarran Airport&quot;, kind of a &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; for the 2000s. If you like the Free Design at all, you should be enjoying this CD as soon as possible without compunction. If you are unfamiliar with the group, order the &quot;Best Of&quot; or the too-expensive Japanese issue of &quot;You Could Be Born Again&quot; along with &quot;Cosmic Peekaboo&quot;.........you won't be sorry. If all Free Design fans purchase the new set, maybe we'll persuade the Dedricks to continue their excellence with further new recordings. I certainly hope so. Music like this is too precious to take for granted
0	I HAVE SONG WHEN OLIVIA KISSES REAL SEBASTIAN the song is called "love" by matt white and i had a hard time finding it too but it's because his cd doesnt come out until feb 2007. he has a myspace and the song was also in the movie little manhatta
1	Romantic tunes This is a nice CD to bring back more soothing and romantic music. Wanted a more diverse collection to add to my currect CDs.
0	Nostalgic Kitsch on a Theme of Guaraldi ...or, how to make a quick buck on someone elses stuff. Or, to summarize with a trite phrase, &quot;Can't Beat the Real Thing&quot;. The legendary Guaraldi wrote jazz that is akin to American culture, and is loved by all. This translation takes something that was perfect and takes it down the other side of the peak. Isn't it enough to enjoy the original works without embellishing it with some popular anecdotes? Would you buy Steely Dan from anyone but Fagen? It just misses the mark, and screws up a good thing
0	Oldies Lover There are a lot of songs on this CD that I don't remember & don't really care for. However, the sound quality is good. Take the time to listen to all the samples before buying
1	A must have for your jazz collection... ...this one. The definitive first half of the Basie &quot;Old Testament Band&quot; studio catalogue. Good-quality sound, for the era, as well as excellent remastering of the source material. These versions of these songs are what took Basie from a mid-western regional band status to national prominence. Better material than the 3 discs extant comprising most of the second half of the &quot;Old Testament&quot; studio catalogue (&quot;Essential&quot; series, V.1-3 from Columbia Records), as well (if one must choose). I give this one 6 stars from a strictly swing-era only perspective
1	some of triphop's finest Becoming X is great to listen to in almost any situation like get togethers, hanging around the house or whatever. 6 Underground definately helps make the album and the two versions of the song are fabulous
1	A good but imperfect companion volume to "Greatest Hits" Stevie Ray Vaughan's original Greatest Hits album was far too short at just 11 not particularly well chosen tracks, but this 1999 addition goes a long way towards making up for that. It is not a hits package per se, since most of these songs were never released as singles, but it features lots of excellent songs like "Willie The Wimp", "Ain't Gone 'N' Give Up On Love", "Empty Arms", and Vaughan's magnificent rendition of Doyle Bramhall's acoustic survivor story "Life By The Drop". That still doesn't make it a definitive career retrospective, though, even when coupled with "Greatest Hits" vol. I, and the inclusion of tunes like "Pipeline" and "Superstition" is suspect considering what has been left out. At 27 songs, these two albums are trumped by the superb double-disc collection "The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble", which is cheaper than "Greatest Hits" vol. I and II together, yet features a stronger selection of songs, and six more of them as well
0	UNA PORQUERIA, IN ENGLISH THAT MEANS.... Well, I read a few reviews, listened to the samples here on Amazon, and bought the cd. My God! Awful isnt word enough to describe this. Ok, the songs alone are ok, but when you listen to the whole cd, is when you realize that those guys doesnt know many chords, and that all the songs sound the same (a few variations), and that the vocals ARE all the same, well, you have a patetic album. Very weak, very boring, nothing new. They could do better, the lyrics are ok, but they need help, like, music lessons, even better, composition lessons. Is really bad when all the songs in your album are identical. My fellow metalheads, rockers, whatever name you want, DO NOT buy this, get a friend to loan it to you, then if you still want it, well, is your $$. But if you want real music, get Death, or Rush, hey, even Green Day is better option. In the end, High on Fire should be left for begginers in the metal world of music.
1	Underrated hiphop, almost a classic.......... Latifah had all the qualities of a great female MC (flow, beats and them juggs). My personal favorite joint from her. Top Tracks: The Pros King and Queen Creation Come to Me Ladies First Latifah's Law Inside Ou
0	I'd Rather Listen To Hilary Duff Review by Cory Rennison: Major labels never cease to amaze me with their abilities to find the most generic bands out there and sign them. The kind folks over at Maverick Records have put out a new addition to the ongoing borefest that is mainstream music and their name is Stutterfly. Stutterfly has thrown together 13 tracks of power chords, angst-ridden lyrics, and song titles that are laughable at best. Some things that did work for this band were the great sounding vocals, and the rare occasions on the disc when the band attempted to have some actual guitar riffs instead of power chords. There isn't really a whole lot of singing in metal these days, so it was kind of interesting hearing it on this CD, however instrumentally, there's just nothing special here. With only a few key moments here and there, which are easily forgotten anyways, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this album. Chances are I'll forget this band's name by next week
0	Shoulds be called 0/20 This is just absolutely terrible from beginning to end. I'm so sick of these underground d---riders giving this 5 stars. This is garbage. I'd much rather listen to a good commercial rap album than this garbage. The lyrics are boring and wack, the production is bad, and the concepts are stupid. I'm gonna go pick up Cam'Ron's new album "Killa Season" next week and I suggest you go do the same. For good west coast rap, wait for Ice Cube's new album that comes out June 6th. This is one of the year's worst albums
1	Shere Kahn at his finest. People who listen to Andre Nickatina either love him or hate him. I love him. Cant get enough. Horns and Halos is one of the best. Andre's lyrics are random and usually make no sense, but I just love the way it sounds. the beats are addictive, just like his drug habbit
0	Elvis - 2nd to none CD = BAD I ordered "Elvis - 30 #1 Hits" and this CD was fine. Along with that order, I ordered "Elvis 2nd to None". The CD case was damaged, and the actual CD contained songs in it that were damaged... Unfortunately it was a gift that I gave someone in another state, which makes it too complicated to return..
0	Give me the first two records instead... Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step.
1	What a CD!!! This selection is an absolte great one. It is great for parties and just to scare the bejesus out of people. It is not, I dare say, one that you would want to listen to over and over again. It repeats itself in many tracks, but for fun, you've got to have this one
1	my Favorite boxset first off, to all the people who wrote in and said the dvd is not good WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? THE HOLY GRAIL IN THE FORM OF A DVD? THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I'VE SEEN & HEARD. granted jonas does not look terribly happy to be there, but he sounded great. while i, too, got all the studio albums the day they came out i had to get this collection (mainly for the dvd...which does not dissapoint)but also for the unreleased songs...nothing about this set let me down (although i would like to have seen an interview or video on the dvd). FOR ANY FAN OF KATATONIA-DON'T MISS OUT. a lot of it is redundant, but the rest is fantastic
1	THE place to start your Monk collection A great remastered version of one of Monks' masterpiece recordings. Every selection here offers something unexpected and the entire CD swings like crazy. Monks comping on the title track Criss Cross behind Charlie Rouses's temor is something to behold. he is never where you think he's going and yet melodic and perfectly in the tune. This guy was really something special and this CD offers a chance to hear him at his peak. Buy it..you can't go wrong here
1	Bouncin' tribute! "Oh, My NOLA" is a tribute to the Crescent City by native Harry Connick Jr. He grew up playing with jazz greats in the small clubs on Burbon Street, and this album feels like it came from there. Every song sings and dances almost on its own, and jazz-lovers from long ago will remember hits like "Jambalaya (on the Bayou)," "Careless Love," "Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey?" and "Lazy Bones" (with spectacular trombone playing by Lucien Barbarin.) My kids love this one, and we stop everything to sing together on "The Sheik of Araby." The title song, a Connick composition, says it all. This album is a tribute to the heritage of New Orleans, and to the musical tradition that is kept alive by recordings like these. Also check out "Chanson Du Vieux Carre," a jazz recording released at the same time
1	Porcupine Tree Rocks! This is one of the most innovative, talented bands that's come along in a while! If you like Dream Theater, Rush or Queensryche you'll love these guys! Also, check out their newer albums Deadwing & In Absentia! Absolutely brilliant
0	Gotta be honest I've been a Bone fan for 12 years and Bizzy's first 3 solos are classics in my opinion. However, all of the fears that Speaking In Tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release. I still think that Bizzy's a uniquely talented and spiritual man, but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations. The repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing
0	A Disappointment :( Having listened to one of the hottest Balance releases (Desyn Masiello Balance 08), I had high expectations from the follow up release (Paolo Mojo Balance 09). Unfortunately, they are completely opposites when it comes to my listening enjoyment. The tracks in Paolo's compilation are nothing but outdated. I can't wait for Jimmy Van M's release of Balance 10 to erase the bad memories of Paolo's buzz kill.
0	This is a farce, part one By 1976, somebody had the rather strange idea of tearing apart the Australian version of "HIGH VOLTAGE" and "T.N.T", AC/DC's first two albums, and then sew some of the pieces together into this hodgepodge. Who's to blame for this rip off?. Somebody at Atlantic Records?. Some members of AC/DC?. Maybe both?. Who cares anyway?. Certainly the late Bon Scott, a man who never minced words, was not particularly delirious about this idea. As he bitterly screamed in the title track of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP": "Neck ties, contracts, high voltage, done dirt cheap!". Now that I've got used to the Aussie albums, listening back to this "product" feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated, low quality spirits. Even the front cover is ridiculous. Perhaps those who conceived it intended to capture Angus Young's manic frenzy on stage. But the result is hilarious: a picture of Angus Young looking like a retard holding an obviously fake, broken Gibson SG. A real broken guitar would have saved the day (just a little bit). Every enthusiastic record collector knows that both Atlantic records (now Warner Music) and Epic records (now Sony Music) are serious labels that took, and still take risks, by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will. So, it seems that, with their approval of this re-issue, the surviving members of AC/DC are the ones to blame for this farce to go on, and on, and on ... If this is so ... well ... guys, we, the fans, made you filthy rich. We deserve the "real deals", available worldwide, at a "reasonable price". A final word about this re-issue: I don't own it. In the words of Pete Townshend, I "won't get fooled again". Alas, there are no bonus tracks, nor previously unreleased material. For reasons unknown to me, the surviving members of AC/DC seem quite apprehensive about sharing a bit more of their music with us (both Warner Music and Sony Music are reissuing classic albums with tons of bonus/previously unreleased material). If Bon Scott (undisputedly the band's most uncompromising member ever), was still alive, I believe things would be different. By the way, if you are interested in the real stuff, please be so kind as to read my review of ".T.N.T. (Import)". OTHER ITEMS TO BE AVOIDED: The skimpy "retrospective" EP "'74 JAIBREAK", and "BONFIRE", a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice, in different versions. None of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of AC/DC's first four Aussie albums
1	talking about the car wash rose royce was tight my faves are wishing on a star, and love don't live here anymore and can't forget the classic I'm goin down remade by mary j blige, ynv, and more recently camron ooh boy. and can't forget the ghetto classic car wash you ain't ghetto til you jammed off that cut so if you feeling rose royce you should get this and keep daddy rich's memory alive
0	Rhino Stumbles I really expected more. Rhino, the author of the Stiff Records and 'Left of the Dial' box sets and the 'Just Can't Get Enough' series assembled this tired set of eighties new wave? Wow. A third of this CD has been anthologized to death. Toni Basil? Men Without Hats? A-Ha? Modern English? Thomas Dolby? Dexy's Midnight Runners? Again??? Where's Nena and "99 Luftballoons"? I could name six more interesting choices in my sleep: Pete Shelley. Freur. Lene Lovich. Heaven 17. Fun Boy Three. Blancmange. Gary Numan, Haircut 100 and Frank & Moon Zappa lend a breath of fresh air, and Rhino does their usual stellar job of remastering, but it's not enough. This is for the person who: A. is an extremely casual music fan (i.e. buys a CD about every other year), or B. is too young to have been around when these songs were all over the airwaves. Otherwise, you likely have the better stuff on this CD elsewhere, and who needs to hear "Mickey" ever again? (And I mean EVER again.) If you fit one of the two profiles listed above, you'll be completely content. If you don't--save your money.
1	A magnificent cd from one of the best groups Proably one of the best cd Queen has did since, A Night At Opera. That and also knowing the fact that this would be Queen's last cd together. I mean, words can't begin to describe how good this cd is. Inneundo is like one musical painting. With songs like "Deliah, Bijou" and the title track itself, "Innuendo" that just inspire the imagination and the soul. But, it also has some very moving tracks too, "The Show Must Go On" and "These are the days of our lives". That are so wonderful. Innuendo is a great cd and is most defantly worth listening to.
1	Would've been 5 stars if it wasn't for the Outlaws Look, it's not that I don't like The Outlaws,in fact I have much respect for them for bein loyal and true to Pac , but to be quite honest,lyricly, they might be the worst group of rappers Iv'e ever heard in my life.The fact that this album went Double Platinum tells you everything you need to know about 2Pac's popularity more then anything else. Okay Hussein Fatal(who for some reason isn't even on the album) was cool and Kadafi(R.I.P.) was okay, but the rest of them,at best, were a little below average.I can't tell you how many Pac songs they've brought down because of their obvious lack of lyrical talent. With that being said, I really do think that this was a good album. The stand out tracks for me are "Mr.President", "Secrets Of War"(Pac comes off nice on this one.He also has an unreleased verse on this song), "Homeboys", "The Good Die Young", "killuminati", "Hell For A Hustler","Baby Don't Cry" and "Tattoo Tears". My favarite song on this album has to be "Hell For A Hustler". Pac's rage and emotion on this song is unbelieveble. "Whatching over me threw every murder scene" "Guess you can call me anti-social,n****z shaken like they caught the holy ghost when I approach you". Bottom line,if your a fan of 2Pac then you should probably snatch this album up because Pac's lyrics on this album alone is worth the price even though he's only rapping on 1-2 verses per song.
1	Tonight is right for Love (With Meredith Baxter-Birney) Chef Aid is worth the buy. This very funny record includes &quot;live&quot; intros to each song by Chef, not to mention a selection of his greatest hits, like the title above my review, which he performs with Meatloaf. Cartman and the gang join the fun as well, along with Ned, Primus, Rick James w/ Ike Turner, Rancid, Wyclef, Devo, and Elton John? Buy Chef Aid and play it with someone you love
1	Trent is the man! Not surprisingly t-rez comes up wit another great sounding album. I swear the only way to listen to this is LOUD very very LOUD! its very noisy but great at the same time cant wait for pt.2 but i think its going to be a movie, who knows
0	Wakes you up instead This CD was supposed to be soft, easy music that would help you go to sleep. I did go to sleep almost immediately but not because of the music--I was just very tired. However, the music actually woke me up a couple of times when it got just a little louder. Maybe it's me, but I didn't find this product to do as promised.
0	Lorraine Hunt Lieberson Sings Peter Lieberson: Naruda Great voice, totally uninteresting music. For me, not accessible. Not lyrical enough. Almost funereal. My musical 'horizons' apparently are not broad enough for this one
1	Way ahead of it's time If you need a quick introduction to Amon Duul II this is the album for you .The album showcases Amon Duul at their best and with the best line up and with a great set of songs.Other Amon Duul II albums have long tracks and improvisations that take a while to get into .This is one of my favorite albums of all time .The live Version of Archangels Thunderbird is just awesom
0	Unoriginal, cheap tricks. More like talent show. Blast is a very well-coordinated show, as it is suposed to be. It employs a variety of different themes, instruments, and atmostphere, unlike, say, Stomp. But Blast does not feel like a theatrical piece. The majority of the show cold be played during a highschool football halftime or at an amusement park and could be well-recieved, but not in a theater. Where the producers do attempt to showcase some artistic originality, they fail quite miserably. Performers are enthusiastic, but they just don't deliver the absorbing, fascinating dynamics that, for example, Stomp does
0	$15 is about right I have no idea whether Mr. Spector is guilty of the serious charges against him, but he stands convicted of allowing his retrospective box to be released with some of the muddiest, dullest mastering in memory. Sound-wise, a total mess. Of course, many of the tracks are indispensable.
1	All of Yoko's Best Work on 1 CD! This is the best CD in the world! Yoko is the best and every song is great and her voice, so soothing. 5*!
1	Beckola! A must have along with Blow By Blow and wired. Worth it for Big block and Guitar Shop songs alone. Jeff Beck, the man, the myth, the legend
0	What's so freakin' great about this? I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department. As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average. It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked. Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia. Want real 80's metal (not glam)? Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others
1	Bach, Moog, and Carlos There's very little enjoyable as seeing the Brandenburg's put on by a live group of musicians. Switched-On is the antithesis of that experience: a work completed in the studio with extensive dubbing. Yet, hearing this again, after so many years, is a reminder of Bob Moog's analog synthesizer and Wendy Carlos' comprehensive application. Carlos did not show how to compose for the synthesizer, the way Stockhausen and Subotnick had. This was exclusively a study in tone-shaping and arranging for synthesizer. Bach, an organ master, would have been the first person to test-drive Moog's creations had he been alive. Analog synths sound more organic than digital ones, and Moog's are distinctive even in that category. [If you are looking for Carlos' interpretation of Beethoven's 9th, for A Clockwork Orange, that music is unfortunately not included in this set.
0	Bottom of the heap This album is seriously bland. Smulch in spoonfulls. I can't understand how JT's record label would allow him to release music so lacking in any spirit whatsover. God only knows what encoraged me to buty it. My advice to you is keep well away
0	Where is the ICE CUBE I know ? What happened ? Ice Cube is my favorite rapper of all time! For anyone else this would have been 3 stars, but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly. If you like the older HARD hitting Ice Cube and NWA I would try one of his earlier releases. Who knows though... I love plenty of CDs that I hated at first
1	Colonel Abrams is Major!!!!! The Best of Colonel Abrams is a bright collection of the artist's dance classics and quiet storm masterpieces. With the CD opener "Specutlation" you have a good sense of what is about to come. With such hits and Garage classics like "Trapped", "I'm not gonna let" and "How soon we forget" this makes the CD one of the best dance artist collections thus far. The Best of also covers some of the quiet storms recording such as " Marquex" and "Table for two" with is also worth listening too and shows the diversity of the artist. Many listeners may say "Hey he sounds like Teddy Pendergrass!" but trust me he has a style and voice all his own. Trust me this is also a must have and you will get your moneys worth. Buy it!!
1	A Fine Album Made Better There is an eerie haunting sound to this 4rd album from The Band..the production is noticeably slicker, funky horns,the songs juxtapose upon each other unlike the thematic soundscapes found on their 3 prior efforts. If their first album, Music From Big Pink was the soul, their 2nd,The Band, the heart, their 3rd, Stage Fright,raw emotion, then Cahoots is the mind..these well crafted produced songs featuring the likes of New Orleans legend A. Touissant, a great belting Van Morrison, all add to a fine album worthy of being part of any one's collection..As a matter of fact, 2 great Band classics, their stellar version of Dylan's troubadour gypsy classic "When I Paint My Masterpiece" and the funky "Life Is A Carnival" are well worth the 5 stars allotted this review. The eerie vocal mixes throughout, a group somewhat not sounding comfortable but in Cahoots with it all..poised for stardom and somehow throwing it all away in their persistence of authenticity is a theme felt throughout these tracks...the strained guitar chords of Robbie Robertson, the pain found in Danko's and Manuel's singing, the ever present exuberance of the highs and lows found in Levon Helm's voice and the keyboard wizardry of that mad tinkerer Garth Hudson all add to an album hard to find the likes of nowadays. The Band gels and manage to shine in the right places. The extra tracks are all stellar,Endless Highway,Bessie smith,Don't Do It..
0	Skip it and get a real Muddy Water or Howlin' Wolf CD When I was buying this, I did not know much about Muddy's or Wolf's discography, and I didn't bother reading any reviews. In fact, I first thought it might be Muddy's own original CD called "Muddy and the Wolf" for some strange reason. It isn't. Half of this CD is Muddy Waters, and the other half is Howlin' Wolf. This is not a collaboration either. This is SOME of the material taken from Muddy's highly acclaimed Fathers and Sons CD and SOME of the material taken from Wolf's London Sessions and basically glued together into one incomplete disc. If you think you want a *sample* of either man's style, this is probably a bad place to start because it only represents Muddy late in his career doing electrical blues and Wolf in a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration with the British rockers in London. Not a typical sample of each man's career at all. I do own Wolf's London Sessions and find them interesting material, but they are not by any means a true representation of the bluesman that Wolf was. As for Muddy, you'd do much better just getting his Fathers and Sons CD. Save your money here
0	Oh Come ON! Good old Brad Mehldau has once again shown that he can take any pleasant little tune and turn it into something ugly enough to have made Alban Berg wince. This is the kind of stuff that poseurs love to intellectualize about but no one actually wants to listen to. If Bill Evans had been immature, ignorant and narcissistic he would have been Brad Mehldau. Don't waste your money
1	Excellent This album is probably Mana's finest work. This is basically the last album they did before they went overly pop-oriented. The album art is simple, just the band with their instruments. While other albums try to catch your eye with flashy cover art, this album may go unnoticed. However, there isn't a bad song on this disc, and it is worth every penny. The songs range from love songs, to songs about difficult life circumstances, and all the songs are sung with incredible raw emotion. The music is great, and it goes with the lyrics and voice perfectly. This is the album that shows everything Mana is capable of. Incredible
1	And this is the message from the Ruler Rick crew This Cd is a classic. To this day (as was the case at a cousin's wedding reception recently in Charlotte, NC), the likes of "Children's Story" and "The Moment I Feared" can still pack dance floors nearly 20 years later. Overall, this is one of the best rap Cds of all time. Ricky "Slick Rick" Walters was/is the UNCROWNED KING (well, since he was also known as "Rick the Ruler", maybe he WAS crowned) of rap storytelling. This is one of the few rap Cds that are as much fun to listen to as well as dance from. He was a brilliant, creative, and imaginative lyricist and rhymester with his unique style, and no two songs on this Cd are lyrically or musically alike. He was one of the few who took full advantage of the format of rap to tell some really interesting stories that took listeners to another level. The one downnote is that Rick sends some really mixed messages here. While "Children's Story" and the lovely "Hey Young World" as well as "Teenage Love" has our hero laying down some pretty positive stuff for his younger fans, there's also the negativity and misogyny of "Treat Her Like a Prostitute","Indian Girl," and "Lick The (you get the idea)" that foreshadowed the lows that NWA and future rappers would take along this dark line. In another ugly sign of things to come, Rick's publicized imprisonment (from a case eerily similar to "Children's Story")stifled his future output and stalled a great career (as would be the case with many future, albeit less talented, rappers) It would be nice if he were to record with his onetime partner and fellow storyteller Dana Dane of the unrecorded Kangol Krew of the early 80s. Now THAT would be an amazing record (they appeared together only once in recent years to my knowledge in a film perfroming with Rick's later partner Doug E. Fresh). But we can be thankful for what's here and enjoy it for what it is. The title fits. Good night
1	AWESOME!!! once again Wynton and the LCJO come through with a magnificent performance
1	He's the Wolf This is not a very tough choice, if you like Howlin' Wolf or the blues get this box. It has not weak tracks, some fascinating interviews (well The Wolf talking), and many of the classic, indispensable tracks.Plus, there's, as evidenced here, no other electric blues guitarist nearly as nasty, dirty, just downright awesome as Hubert Sumlin. Buy and enjoy, this is the blues at its best
1	HERES HOW TO MEET THE BEATLES..... If not for "The Blue Album" I would have probably never became a fan of The Beatles. Back in the day-day they had virtually no influence on me whatsoever. I knew many a song from the old days of Beatle-mania, I wanna hold your hand type of stuff. I wasn't terribly impressed. Than one day I was introduced to SGT. PEPPER and ABBEY ROAD thru a friend, and I realized that there actually was a reason why The Beatles are so legendary. In my book the years 1967-1970 are the better Beatle years. More experimental, less poppish, and more.... waaaaaaaavy maaaaaan. More ROCKIN' to say the least. The red and blue albums are perfect starter packs for The Beatles. Someone managed to pick just the right songs to put on both collections. (RED is for the Beatle-maniacs, and BLUE is for the acid eating Beatle-maniacs) both were mixed just right. Sure you don't get everything, but there is far too much to ask for. You get the full versions of the stuff that you are bound to know, and if not will take to quickly and both sets are quality hits packages. I remember when I was around 14 and decided I was gonna get myself a Beatles record. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted at first.. but one look at the track list on here, and I knew I wanted this one. I chose correctly. The best Beatles hits pack available.
1	Leaves You Motionless While Your Mind Races Out Of Control!! If you've listened to enough trance mixes you may already be familiar with BT. For example: BT's Godspeed and Dreaming are featured in some of Dj Micro's mixes ( Dj Mixed & Micro-Tech Mix 2.0 ). If you can recall, these tracks have been more than entrancing. This CD contains the whole package including those two amazing tracks and the other featured tracks in this mix is incredible! It is difficult to make a decision off the bat whether or not to get this CD since Amazon doesn't have a preview feature. But trust me, I took the plunge based on the reviews alone and I couldn't have been more pleased. Here is a breakdown of some tracks on the CD: 1.) Movement In Still Life - This track is the intro to the CD and starts off with a skit phone call, with some guy (who sounds like some beat junky) talking, saying he wants to make some fresh hits. It's funny because he says to call him back @ his mom's house and if he's at his grandmas, call his pager. As cheezy as this sounds Track 1 quickly transitions into some hard hitting beats with a nice Urban B-Boy feel to it. 10/10 6.) Dreaming - This is a nice track. It starts out a little slow and gradually brings you back up to speed. This track features vocals by Kristy Hawkshaw whos voice is very soothing. Some insight to some of the lyrics included in the chorus are: "No words no talk, We'll go Dreaming; No Pain no hurt, We'll go Dreaming." Near the end of track the vocals reverb and fade into some motivating beats. 9/10 7.) Giving Up The Ghost - This track follows the previous track almost by suit and carries the same trance beat with some new sounds and synthesizers. Since this CD is a continous mix, I believe this track was included to support the next selection. Whether or not that's fact, the transition between these two tracks ( 7 & 8 ) are very tasteful. 8/10 8.) Godspeed - Here is where you want to turn up the volume, adjust your highs and lows, turn the bass down a few notches so the deep base on this track doesn't drown out the inspirational feel. As this track spins above the lasers of your CD player, the ground beneath you feet seems to vanish and leave you in suspense. The enticing female vocal quivers elate your senses and unexpected booms and repercussions of the base send you freefalling, landing within the tides of machine beats sending you to a far away corner of your brain so you can TRANCE OUT. I give this one an amazing 10/10. 10.) Running Down the Way Up - This is one of my favorite selections. This track starts out with an acoustic guitar interlude for about 20-30 seconds, then some attractive female vocals come to the forefront. The vocals really set the scene and are heard throughout the the entire track. What makes these vocals all the more appealing, the begining vocals are whiped with exotic reverbs and channel mixing which make this track what some refer to as "ear candy". Then the excitement ends with impressive electric guitar rifts and licks. I classify this one a 10/10
0	Worse than a bad recording Pros: They sing well. Cons: None of the carols are complete. They draw you in with a little teaser, tack on a big finale, then dash on to the next just as you start responding. Worse, the tracks bleed into one another, so randomizing playback sounds just awful. I'd love to have a recording of unabridged Christmas carols with this caliber of musicality, but can't recommend this cd
1	Solid, though a litle monotonous at times (3.5 estrellas) The songwriting on this album is really good, the level of musical ability of the band is high, and the hits are solid. The album comes out of the gate with a bang due to the single "Puedes Contar Conmigo". I think our local pop station here in Atlanta has overplayed "Rosas", but it is a classic. Amaia has a sweet and alluring voice, however a whole album of it will tire you out. This is not something you will want to listen to from beginning to end. I would suggest they let other band members sing 2 or 3 of the songs on their next album to break the monotony. Amaia can sing and definitely should lead the singing (plus she is a good songwriter), though. Perhaps this is why Julieta Venegas' albums are short - to keep her fans from tiring of her distinct, recognizable voice. This album proves why they are a supergroup with enormous popularity. Its worth spending the money to buy the album, but one must strongly consider buying las canciones individuales if they are not a major fan
1	Yes it is swampy honky tonk, but also deep soul food Add James Luther Dickinson to the pile of producer/artists whose influence is vast but whose recognition, except with cognoscenti, is minimal. He is in august company, and runs a North Mississippi/Memphis recording studio on par with Cowboy Jack Clements's outside Nashville. With the revival of attention in southern roots music prompted by the best selling "O Brother Where Art Thou?" soundtrack and live recording, it is surprising Dickinson's own contribution, now available on CD, is overlooked. For with this album Dickinson gives a voice more authentic than a mere preservationist. This is far beyond the earliest Dickinson sounds from the Sun-influenced "The Goat Dancers" period. Indeed, the guitar solo on "Wine" is a fabulous execution worthy of Junior Brown, while the jackhammer piano is full-on honky-tonk, and if it were not for Dickinson's bulk you'd think the Killer himself had kicked over the piano stool to rip it out. The drums can barely keep up, and the wet voices of backup singers already sneak in notes they will scream horizontally in the after show entertainment. And this is only the first cut on the album, not the best cut on the album. There are, perhaps, certain points of comparison with early recordings of "Little Feat," to which this reviewer can only respond: they stole it all from Dickinson
0	LACKLUSTER GREATEST HITS The exclusion of one of Reba's TRUE greatest Hits "Till You Love Me" and the inclusion of such wretched tunes as "Why Haven't I Heard from You" and "One Honest Heart" makes me want to just cry. This is a lackluster greatest hits album not noteworthy by any means.
0	Pointless This album is a mess. It bounces around and resembles a long warm up. It does not seem to have a direction as it bounces around between a lot of different types of music and never finds a home with any of them
1	Manheim Steamroller's American Spirit Another excellent CD I'd recommend to all ages, even us oldsters!
0	Not what I think of when I think Manheim Steamroller This wasn't a bad CD, but it was NOT what you typically think of when you think of Manheim Steamroller music. I was expecting electronica patriotic music. I got a kinda old trucker country sort of music. No wonder it's so cheap compared to the other MS cds..
1	Enough of this Broadway vs London stuff. Let's add Australia to the picture Like most people, I've been torn between London and Broadway for a while. I'll admit, I'm fond of both London and Broadway, but some songs I like on Broadway more than London, and vice versa. However, when I bought the Australian recording, it turned into my favorite CATS recording, hands down. They have EVERY song in there, (Growltiger's Last Stand, and Battle of the Pekes and Pollicles) Anyhow, here's my biased opinion on which of the three recordings dominate in certain songs. Overture - The overture is pretty much the same Jellicle Song for Jellicle Cats - London Naming of Cats - Australia Invitation to the Jellicle Ball - Broadway Old Gumbie Cat - London but Australia's is pretty darn good Rum Tum Tugger - I'm not very fond of London's version or Broadway's. I'd have to say Australia, but Broadway is just as good. Grizabella - London Bustopher Jones - London Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer - Australia. This version has a very interesting Mungo and Rumpel Old Deuteronomy - London or Broadway Jellicle Ball - London Grizabella: The Glamour Cat - Tie Memory - Okay, Elaine Paige is about as good as it gets. But Debbie Byrne from Australia delivers a heart felt Memory also. Gus: The Theatre Cat - Australia Growltiger's Last Stand/The Ballad of Billy McCaw - All are good Macavity: The Mystery Cat - Australia Mr. Mistoffelees - Australia. The Australian Rum Tum Tugger is a lot better. And while I'm a huge Sarah Brightman fan, and you can hear her overpowering in this song, I still say Australia wins here. Memory - Moment of truth. I love Elaine Paige. Her Memory is as good as it gets. However, some would say that Elaine's version is too soft and sweet, and isn't bitter and cold enough. This song could go both ways. Betty Buckley certainly expressed rage and power in this song, but maybe too much. In my personal opinon, Elaine's version is too soft, and Buckley's version is too cold. Debbie Byrne is a perfect medium, and she expresses remorse, sorrow, pain, anger, and loneliness in perfect harmony. I'd have to say Australia. Journey to the Heaviside Layer - Not much of a difference. Tie between all three. Ad-Dressing of Cats - Broadway. THANK GOD FOR KEN PAGE
0	Greyboy???? Listening to this album puzzled me. I went into it ...backwards, I liked Greyboy's later stuff, so I figured I'd check out this band. I was disappointed. This is really groovy and the musicians aren't bad, but it's like one of those Jam band things. I don't mind jam bands, but their sound is too loosely wrought for me. And there is a little too much noodling with instruments that seems a little aimless. If you like the Greyboy Allstars, you will probably like this. But if you are buying this for Greyboy, don't
1	GREAT To answer the reviewer below, I have listened to this CD five times already. It still rules. What does the "test of time" mean? You can pretty well forget how this album sounds like and be amazed by it ten years later. One listen could be well enough as well. It's great, that's all. It's not a usual collection of songs, it's something else - for the better. I have a lot of records in my collection, and for a change, I'm really happy to own something different. At least *this* record is unique in its own way. Also, it's one of the best tributes to American roots, and especially to the Beat Generation, that I've ever heard. Musically and spiritually. This record is the work of an artist and of a human person willing to express something in the best way possible. Got it
0	A Charlie Brown Schmalzfest As others have noted, the &quot;Charlie Brown Suite&quot; is a ponderous, overblown arrangement of Charlie Brown tunes accompanied by orchestra and with little improvisation. Noises from the audience (squeaking chairs, etc.) are clearly audible during the quieter moments of the suite. According to the liner notes, Guaraldi's son has uncovered a lot of unissued material on reel-to-reel and other formats. The selections here are from the collection of pianist George Winston, a Guaraldi fan. I hope the remaining material, which he hopes to issue in the future, is better than this. The three tracks aside from the suite are more interesting; however, if you're looking for Peanuts music, you'd be much better off sticking with the three other Guaraldi Charlie Brown CDs currently available
0	A lukewarm effort for the boys from the jungle... Close but no cigar Beneath the Remains, Sepultura's 3rd album from 1989 This album, along with Chaos A.D. and Arise, is considered to be the embodiment of Sepultura's classic era, and many fans consider this to be one of the finest, if not the finest installment in the band's catalog. With that said, this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else. There are a lot of great riffs, great solos, and a lot of time changes, which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans. Be that as it may, though, you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record. It's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality. An album like this really can't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre, such as Metallica's ...And Justice For All, Iron Maiden's Powerslave, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. I would give a track-by-track evaluation, but nothing really stands out here. I also have a gripe with Max Cavalera's vocals. I was really not pleased with what I heard from him, as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career. Andreas Kisser and Cavalera sound pretty good on guitar. The standout track would probably be "Slaves of Pain." There's a great little bit around the two minute mark where Cavalera sings, "Open your eyes / Don't lose your steps / Liberty is a dream / And it also is real," then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo. Drummer Igor Cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance. This disc has something to offer, but what I've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just can't get into no matter what you do. Unfortunately, Beneath the Remains fell into the latter category for me.
1	Great guitar, grating vocals. Granted, it is obvious that the guitar work here, is worthy of placement among the best blues records out there. But as always, Winters vocals range from the grating, to the almost comical charactures, they devolved into later(and not much later at that),in his career. The guitar work deserves 6 stars, minus 2 for the vocals = 4
0	maybe youre the whiner. OOOOOOHHHHH seriously though, i tried to like this band but i cant do it. i felt like id heard every song before, and in case of 'loose lips' i definitely had. i dont think ive ever seen such a blatant rip-off in my life. if i were thursday id be pissed. im not in thursday and IM pissed
1	Shania Twain at her absolute best, great songs too! This is the first Shania Twain album that I ever bought and it still sounds as fresh to me as the day I bought it. Her personality and gift for singing with real feeling comes across here more strongly than most of her albums. There is a sensitivity, warmth and zest for life that is communicated that is hard to put into words. Both the fast and slow songs on this album are very good and the ballads are particularly moving
0	Icarus and Nepoegotism Phaeton's son flew On wings of wax into sun Crashed and burned instea
0	"JUMPING JOE" WAS MEANT TO SING THE BLUES! NOT THIS! If you're looking for some of "Jumping Joe's" classic blues (See Rick "Shaq" Goldstein's previous FIVE STAR review of "BLUES DELUXE"!) this is not the CD for you. If you want middle of the road rock guitar, and not the full "smoldering, cauldron, of thunder and lightning, guttural, volcanic, power, vocals, that "Jumping Joe", is capable of, this is for you. For a true "Jumping Joe" blues fan, the only thing this CD will do for you, is complete, your collection of his music, and you won't wonder if you missed something. In closing, a personal note to "Jumping Joe: "please record more classic electric blues! When you put out something like "Blues Deluxe" you are truly the greatest living electric blues man under 70 years old! This CD is beneath you and your loyal blues, "street gang!
0	Absolute disappointment - BEWARE! I am a huge fan of Enigma and have all four of their previous albums, which are absolutely excellent. This is why I was so disappointed with this one. It is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up. The entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying, harsh, distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears. It seems to me that in this music Michael Cretu has become a modern-day German full of Angst and self pity that no one could care less about. Boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album
1	Fantastic!! Frederic Chopin is a very talented artist and composer. A must have of any Chopin collector
0	I had to say something.... I have read many, but never written a review before. I felt compelled this time. I recently purchased this CD and thought it a collection of the most ridiculous music ever. There are a couple of nice tunes but what seems like it may have potential, is abruptly destroyed by some incongruent whim. Thinking perhaps that I was being a musical snob, I asked the opinion of a friend. She and I laughed so hard at how awful it was, so, I went for a third opinion. The result was the same. In fact it got worse with each listening. We've decided that it will make a nice "booby prize" for my next party. Avoid this like the plague. It is musically inconsistent, non-relaxing and a complete source of irritation. If you want your dinner guests to leave early by all means play this
0	Not really a "Special Edition" Soundtrack.... Yeah, ummm Disney, ya went wrong ONCE AGAIN! This soundtrack only has three new songs as followed: Dancing on a Cloud (Demo) (Only really new track which is already on the DVD) Beautiful (On Jim Brickman's The Disney Songbook CD) Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (On Disney Mania 3) So if you already own the original soundtrack, Jim Brickman's awesome Disney CD, Disney Mania 3 CD, and the Cinderella Special Edition DVD... PLEASE skip this CD. Thank you! :
0	I'm Going To Keep It Real Actually, I'm going to keep it really real. I know most of you reviewers who gave this album 4-5 stars reviews are too blinded by 1980's nostalgia to see and hear that this music is utter crap. Vanity 6 was hot back in the day, but it was due to their s1utty image and not their music. Why do you think the only song you hear by them on the radio is "Nasty Girls"? That's the only song people remember them for. Let me tell you a secret: This CD isn't worth $29.52. In fact it shouldn't be worth anything because the music is boring- nothing 'hilarious' or 'interesting' about it. Plenty of of melodies being sung in warbly vocals over Casio go-go beats w/ no bass. I was able to download all of the tracks and after I listened to them, I thanked my lucky stars that I didn't spend one dime on it. Vanity was beautiful, but she couldn't sing or dance. Susan tried to portray herself as cute and innocent, but she couldn't really pull it off with that moustache. Brenda was just whatever. I feel sorry for anyone who buys "Vanity 6"
1	Excellent CD! The Eurythmics fifth album entitled "Revenge" finds the Lennox/Stewert duo completing their journey from the New Wave of their early days and the more R&B/Soul of their previous album "Be Yourself Tonight" into a near total rock/pop sound. It was unfortunately where the Eurythmics commercial run started to wind down. That's not to say that this is a decline. Not at all. Even though a good majority of the songs fall into the category of typical mid-1980s rock and pop, there are many standout songs that make this a wonderful illustrious release from this duo. The famous hit song "Missionary Man" is my favorite Eurythmics song ever. The lyrics are among my favorite that Annie has ever written. Other great songs include "The First Time" with it's excellent and bizarre guitar effects as well as the fifth track. The bonus tracks are very good but the remix of "Missionary Man" is a bit overstretched.
1	This is a great album!! BUY IT!! I know there are a bunch of people out there saying "This gives metalcore a bad name" or "The vocalist has a lung disease" but honestly, they aren't metalcore. Trivium, Shadows Fall, etc. are classified metalcore, and they are definately not like them at all. Their music is much more melodical than others and have great guitars solos, namely the intro to "Bleeding Mascara". Let's go through each track one by one: 1. Blood Children - 3/5 - A nice intro that has a nice lead into the following song 2. Bleeding Mascara - 5/5 - I cannot stress enough how great of a song this is. The guitars in this song are amazing and the lyrics are very advanced. Very nice high paced song that is great for getting your adrenaline going. 3. Right Side of the Bed - 4/5 - This song has a very catchy drum rhythm that keeps you listening through the entire song. They chose this song to make a music video for, which was also nicely done. 4. This Flesh Is A Tomb - 3/5 - This song isn't the greatest on the album, but definately a fine song that is worth listening to. 5. You Eclipsed By Me - 5/5 - This song was the song that got me addicted to Atreyu's music. "I will not be broken, I am, the one" BOOM!! This song is a blast of harsh lyrics that will leave you breathless! 6. The Crimson - 4/5 - This song also has a music video for it. It's not the fastest paced song, but if you enjoy singing/screaming along with your music, this would definately be the easiest to do so. 7. The Remembrance Ballad - 1/5 - This song was probably the most boring song on the entire album. It never picks up at any point in time, the lyrics are weak, and the singing is terrible. Very easily could have been left off of the album. 8. The Interlude - 3/5 - Not sure if it was completely necessary, but it was a nice way to slow you down before getting hit with the next song. 9. Corseting - 5/5 - This song is bursting with energy! A crazy high paced song that keeps your rolling through the entire song. It's hard for anyone not to enjoy this song! 10. Demonology & Heartache - 3/5 - Not my favorite, but definately is a nice song. The guitars in the song are very nice and add a great amount of melody to the song. 11. My Sanity On The Funeral Pyre - 3/5 - It was really hard to rate this song, because it has a very slow intro and has a hard time picking up, but after it starts it does has some very cool bass guitaring that makes the song fun to listen to. 12. Nevadas Grace - 5/5 - This song is probably the most fun-sounding out of the album. Peaceful, yet with the screaming it still keeps the song very interesting. 13. Five Vicoden Chased With A Shot Of Clarity - 4/5 - A nice way to end this album. A slightly slow intro, but definately picks up with both guitars and has a very creepy guitar ending that leaves you desperate for more! This album is definately worth buying, don't let your collection be without it
1	Burton Cummings was Certainly an Underrated Vocalist!!! When one mentions the best rock singers of all time, how come Burton Cummings' name doesn't come up? All the evidence exists on this disc that he was one hell of a singer, delivering some of the greatest vocals to some of the greatest songs ever. Perhaps because The Guess Who was seen as a Top 40 group has kept him from his due? Let's start with one of the top three songs ever put to tape, "These Eyes." This masterpiece has all the ingredients of a timeless song - moving bass line, masterful strings, catchy rhythm, and the pained vocal stylings of Burton. Elsewhere, he shines on "Undun," "No Time," and elevates the standard "American Woman" to legendary, something that Lenny Kravitz had no chance of doing. Kudos to the compilers of this for going with the full length version of "American Woman" - the intro is absolutely essential to its impact. I don't forsee The Guess Who ever making it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but let's at least recognize one of the greatest voices in rock and letting these timeless tunes wash over us in AM ecstasy!
1	This is why melodic death is good Whatever happened to the good old days where Swedish music truly ruled. Now, melodic death seems to be dying out in that country, with classic bands such as Soilwork, In Flames, and Arch Enemy all having changed their sounds completely. I'm talking about the good old experimental days where everything might've seemed risky but the price of success even greater. Albums like "Slaughter of the Soul" are true masterpieces. They only come once for a band. Every known melodic death band has that classic album, and for At The Gates, although they are no dead, this is it. And to tell you the truth, this is actually where melodic death started, which is in no means bad. It is fresh and brutal, probably what many people resort to rather than the melodic side of the music that bands tend to release now
1	The Song in the Movie and In the VW Commercial Hey, like many of you I came to this page looking for the song that appears in both the trailer for &quot;Adaptation&quot; and the VW commercial. The song is E.L.O's &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;. I hope that can help some people out
0	well, it's progression.......but backwards lets revisit the history of the band plain white t's. their debut album "stop" was a very anthem filled songs about life and relationships that would appeal to mostly to people in highschool or perhaps young college students. this being said because the album talks alot about doing something with your life at pivotal moments and of course relationships. next, came their highly anticipated "all that we needed" album and it had more of a 80's power pop/dance sound to it along with some of the songs possibly being mistaken for the band "the cars". it had a more diverse vibe to it and i could see it appealing to highschoolers and most definitely college students. than this summer they released "hey there delilah ep" which was a solid ep which could appeal to many young adults with its mature sound to it. i figured since the ep was so good, that their debut for major label, hollywood records, would be fantastic. well, just the opposite folks. the plain white t's have went backwards on "every second counts". i mean way backwards...back even before their debut album "stop". i say this because the whole theme of the album is about relationships, relationships, and relationships. after about halfway through the album it sounds like you're listening to a broken record. OKAY, I GET IT! some girl screwed you over, and then you screwed her over and now you really don't like each other anymore. the lyrics is what really kills this album along with the cliche songs. the lyrics in their first single, "hate (i really don't like you)" is a perfect example of this. it cringes to repeat the chorus so i'm not even going to do it. i mean, the lyrics sound like junior high drama instead of maturer songs about life which were in their previous albums. bottom line, they went to writing songs that highschoolers and young adults could relate to, to writing songs that junior high kids could relate to. i'm sorry, but that's not progression. i guess another word you could throw at these guys is "sellout" because that could very well be the case here. i'm just going to pretend they didn't release this and enjoy their other albums. don't get me wrong, the songs are catchy and all but the album just gets old and tiring after halfway through. i can't recommend this or not recommend this to anyone. old fans might enjoy, but also despise it like i do. anyways, their other albums are good so buy them before you ever even consider buying this one. download first..
1	Journey to the pass This Cd was when Dance music was ruling the world. Take a journey back to the time of real music, and not a bunch of noise coming out of their mouths. Music had a beat, a rhythm a style and most of all, it had class. You had to look at your best to be able to get into Studio 54. Today, even with a baseball cap and eating a microphone you can talk sing. On this CD, you had to be the best to be able to Dance, Dance, Dance. The music on this Cd will take you back in time and relive the beauty of the dance floor, lights, and heart pounding bass that MADE you dance all night. This CD does just that.
0	What happened Morten? Sirenia is the only band who has never produced a song I didn't like--until now. I bought this new release expecting to love it all, with one or two epics like Euphoria, Sister Nightfall, or Lithium and a Lover. What did I get instead?--46 minutes of pop radio. Gone is the violin, and rare is Morten's voice. We get a bunch of Monika (who has a solid voice, but every song sounded the same). Please, Morten, tell us this is an early April fool's joke and that the real release is coming out April 2.
1	One of Alan Jackson's Best CDs I am a big fan of Alan Jackson, and &quot;Who I Am&quot; is, in my opinion, his best CD. There are two excellent re-makes of earlier songs on this CD, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;Thank God For The Radio&quot;, and they are both very good. I especially like Jackson's guitar playing on &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;. This CD spawned several other hits as well, such as &quot;Livin' on Love&quot;, &quot;Gone Country&quot;, &quot;I Don't Even Know Your Name&quot;, and the title track. All songs on this CD are typical Jackson: great ballads intermixed with some fun, up-tempo songs. This disc has a little bit for everybody. Country fans are sure to enjoy this fine CD from Alan Jackson
1	$$$ unless you're a big fan some people want to collect anything that says final fantasy on it. if you're one of them, like me, then get this. the LM box set has only the 2-disc soundtrack in the box. the box is there to hold the soundtrack, the Gackt LM redemption cd/dvd and the PS2 game. it's a very pretty box and the soundtrack has 53 songs on it, including the new singles (Longing & Redemption) from Gackt. amazon.com's importing price is outrageous though. find a local importer for this one, it's only 3,900 yen
0	Live from Las Vegas-Sinatra Poor sound quality, not professionally prepared. Some bits and pieces of a Sinatra live performance but hardly worth listening to unless you're a die-hard fan that cannot get enough of Sinatra
0	Que Hicistes J-Lo?? Can't sing, can barely sing or speak Spanish and can't dance like Shakira...J-Lo loves the camera and "thinks" she's IT. OMG when is this nonsense going to stop? Her "fans" buy this music so this woman "believes" she can sing. She is simply trying to be "Selena" but isn't worthy even a glitter of Selena's gold...you should be ashamed of yourself trying to copy someone so famous, so talented, and now deceased!! And, please, J-Lo stop "trying to laugh like Selena." Selena's laughter was true and full of life and yours is the contrary. Woman, you simply have no talent. Ben Affleck must laugh at your outlandishness at how hard you're trying to portray that you and Marc are "happily married" and Dayanara Torres must thank her lucky stars that you took away the buffoon of her husband who is now your sidekick. Get it girl, your songs are annoying and irritating and it's obvious in this album you're also trying to sing/sound like Marc Anthony...stop! You obviously have no style that's why you keep trying to copy others and wouldn't be surprised if you'll be trying to copy Shakira's moves!! Please no more pretend music and recording studio exec...QUE HICISTES?? Even the album's title is awkward!
0	Poor sound quality If you're looking to recreate the experience you had at a Soul Coughing show, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. This recording is a weak (at best) audience recording that is muffled, muddled, and boomy. I was almost entirely disappointed
1	Tizzight I have had this cd since the day it came out. I have always beena SCC fan, Murdasquad...all of em. This cd is by far the tightest. They have too many tracks that just hurt speakers and have tight a$$ beats. A must have for me.
1	bsb are back for good well what am i supposed to say? bsb have always been great and this song is one of my favorite from this album.i still is an amazing song and i would highly recommend it to any bsb fan! backstreet boys rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Get his other CDs instead This is okay but it is not the sterling brilliant work Charlap does on his three previous efforts at all. Get any of those instead of this one. Get Stardust. Get Somewhere. Get Written in the Stars. Any and all of those three instead of this one. Another warning...this Gershwin one has the annoying Copy Control demon on it so when you load it onto your mp3 it skips and jumps. most annoying. whatever happen to fair use by people who buy the music???
0	this is just boring. ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when it first came out and, sadly, still it's very weak. I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing. By far it's his worst album. He needs to get back with Dan the Automator or something, these tracks are boring and go nowhere, with a couple exceptions-- so if it's dirt cheap it's worth grabbing. This does nothing for me, I hope he gets back on track
0	Two of the same disc I would imagine the discs are good. i was very excited to listen to it on christmas morning. Disc Two seems good, I wouldn't know about disc one as I opened this on Christmas day to find two of disc 2. Nice
1	Boston for the Death Metal Set..... Ahh, death metal. Most people either love it or hate it. One of the biggest complaints levied against the genre in particular is typically the vocal style, which is (to the neophyte) an almost incomprehensible, guttural growl. Sort of like the crypt keeper meets the cookie monster. There are, however, many variations on this style, especially now that more "extreme" heavy metal has become more mainstream mid-decade, leading to a flood of different death metal bands. This Canadian group sets themselves apart primarily through an extremely poppy vocal style and superb musicianship. Sure, the requisite benchmarks of the genre are there-fast, heavy riffs and a vicious, almost acidic death metal bark; but this will suddenly give way to unbelievably catchy, hooky two-and three-part vocal harmonies during a chorus or verse then suddenly revert back to the "evil" vocal style. It really is quite unique and original. I am instantly reminded of the first time I heard a friend's Boston album in the eighties...It really is just a huge wall of sound, extremely well-produced. This really shouldn't work in the context of death metal, but it sounds AMAZING! Meanwhile, the guitarists are shredding all over the place in an often quite progressive and technical, and always ultra-heavy manner, as if they are auditioning for Dream Theater....the album opening deluge of neoclassical-style rapid fire twin-guitar shred licks are a good introduction to what you can expect for the rest of the album. The lyrics are a bit melodramatic, unfortunately, but of course, this is death metal. Sometimes it's kinda cool ("eradication of the mind/beginning of the end") and sometimes it's kinds lame ("floating in a black sea of agony") but always interesting. I am excited to hear the follow-up, which should be the band's big album, if this was just a warm-up....any fan of the genre should check this out, although purists might balk at the "non-traditional" vocal style. Highly recommended
0	Good for those with low standards... I originally became interested in Into Eternity when I saw them open for Stratovarius during the 2005 Monster Metal Madness North American Tour. Even though they weren't the reason I was there in the first place, I though they gave a pretty good performance and I decided to look into their music. Unfortunately, after listening to this album, I'm reminded that first impressions are not always accurate. First of all, I about laughed myself to death at album description under editorial reviews that states this album is "a must for fans of Dream Theater, Iron Maiden... and Nevermore....". This band has absolutely nothing to do with these bands or the music they play (other than the fact Into Eternity probably wishes they were as good as these aforementioned bands that are light years beyond their skills), and is obviously slapped here as a selling point. Then again, I somewhat can't blame Century Media for writting such rubbish, considering Sonata Arctica and Nightwish have left the label for Nuclear Blast (leaving Firewind, Dream Evil and Royal Hunt as the label's sole acts I care about). Also, calling this is CD progressive is a joke as well. The album's only redeeming feature is the main singer (no, not Mr. Death Growl #1 and #2). Unfortunately, the fact he is forced to take turns with the two death growl vocalists and we never get to hear his full range or abilities as they sing songs with lyrics that are so predictable to this kind of music you swear some depressed teenager wrote when he forgot to take his anti-depressants. I'm not saying you can write about death, disease, and everything and anything having to do with moral decay, but you have to make it interesting at least and add some intricate song structure! That said, the only songs on the album worth listening to are Buried In Oblivion and Black Sea of Agony, were the death vocalists take enough of back seat to the main vocalist and spare the listener of their sad attempt of sounding cool. In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, because I can think of so many other bands and albums worthy of metal fans attention and hard earned dollars. Ok, so maybe I'm being a little harsh considering these guys are exactly "superstars" per say, but I think I've been pretty nice so far, as I didn't complain about the production quality or the drummer's stupid habit of banging on the same drum for 15 straight seconds and calling it music. Oh wait, I did complain, whoops...
0	A misinterepretation of beloved Latin classics There is no doubt the artist's voice is beautiful. However, the interpretation of certain songs by a man and child are way off. For example, &quot;Tengo Una Muneca&quot; is NOT a lullaby, but an upbeat children's song and to have a child drone it out debases such a Mexican classic. One of many aweful and inacurate musical interpretations on this misguided CD. For the best and most classic Spanish children's songs turn to the tender and playful &quot;Cri-Cri.&quot
0	If This Is The Real Thing I'll Pass I guess some people out there actually liked this, but not here. "From Out Of Nowhere" is somewhat decent, but after that the rest of this blows dead bears. I especially hate "Epic" which if not for this the group would never had made it. I guess because of the diversity to the song that made it popular, but it made me want to gag, and then vomit as the song doesn't make sense to me for starters, and in the key of E, and just droning on and on for over 5 minutes that it's worse than the gas chamber. After that it just got worse. 17 years has come and gone, and it still stinks.

0	All the others rock Wished I hadn't spent that amazon gift certificate on this one. This sure as hell ain't the rock n' roll of their other albums, which I suppose it's not meant to be. I'm going to pretend that this album never happened and hope that their next release blows the top off the bubbly.
1	A Milestone! Should you ever meet someone who's ranting about "the eighties" and the supposedly "bad" music of that decade... just put on this GREAT record! The songs are well crafted, perfectly recorded and the whole album is absolutely NOT "trendy". With that I mean that you could never tell it was made in 1984. Clearly you can spot it's not from the seventies... but listening back to it, NOW, I notice how it hasn't aged a bit! ...and it features the most classic lineup of the band! You just couldn't ask for more!! ;-
1	Inspiring Music-The Road Home This contains a wonderful and inspiring group of selections and is very well done. The title number accompanies an extremely good picture montage by GCS Distributing.Com which contains pictures of the military in Iraq and is a great emotion grabber. This album is well worth buying and listening to over and over. Stephe
1	Loud glam-rock music of the seventies With a style that mixed lightweight, teenybopper music with heavy metal (a strange mix, indeed), Sweet ultimately ended up falling between the two, not pleasing anybody from either camp. Before that, they scored a string of UK hits including a number one (Blockbuster) and five number twos (Co-co, Hell raiser, Ballroom blitz, Teenage rampage, Fox on the run). Note that Fox on the run is an original song, not a cover of Manfred Mann's song. Little Willy and Wig-wam-bam both made number four in the UK. Their last major hit, Love is like oxygen, made the top ten in Britain and America - it actually did slightly better in America than Britain. All seventeen of the Sweet's UK hits (including the minor hits) are here together with three album tracks that illustrate what Sweet wanted to do with their music. Having had their career controlled others (the production team of Chinn and Chapman), they cut loose on titles such as Restless and Set me free. This is the definitive Sweet hits compilation. If you enjoy British glam-rock of the early seventies with a hard edge, you are likely to enjoy Sweet's music
0	WHAT IS THIS? I loved avp but i mean come on! they made the soundtrack really stink
1	Maybe the best debut of the 90's Gangly garage-rock guitar riffs, breathy French-accented female vocals, catchy tunes with insightful lyrics that capture the exuberance as well a good measure of the angst of youth. &quot;In the Shadows&quot;, &quot;No Guarantee&quot;, &quot;Point of View&quot;, &quot;Don't Believe a Word&quot;--songs like these deserve better praise than I can possibly jot down here. You must listen for yourself! One of the top CD's of the 90's, I think. Their follow-up, &quot;Apartment Life&quot;, though very good, falls into a safer pop groove. I'm looking for their third one to be the first great album of the new millenium
0	Uses for The Gift disc on Blueprint 2 The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras
1	Ethereal This is Morricone at the height of his career. Here he created a score as mysterious and ethereal as the jungles and waterfalls depicted in the film "The Mission." Using a combination of flutes, oboes, strings, choral and other odd wind instruments, Morricone created both a unique and haunting experience that will leave you spellbound long after the last notes have faded from the air. The score could almost be classifed as a requiem, in this case a tribute to a people that are gone (the Guarani natives depicted in this film who were long ago driven from their homes) and the Jesuits who gave their lives to protect them. From the opening scene of the film, the score announces itself as the dominant character in the narrative, taking us from the lonely plight of a missionary on a cross, to the streets of colonial Asuncion, to the mist shrouded rain forest above the falls and the fateful mission where lives and beliefs will be tested to the core, combining native motifs with deep and sweeping string movements to fill in the places in the story where actors and the dialogue are silent, allowing the music to bring us down into an intimate place of reflection where we can embrace the sadness and the transformation that this film evokes. The only piece that I can compare this work to is Richard Strauss' "Death and Transfiguration," both works leave me shaken and nearly moved to tears. However, it's a deeply rewarding feeling to come in contact with works as profound as these. Buy "The Mission" and you will find yourself instantly transported to a place as rare as the bygone world the film depcits.
1	Yeah i loved this cd. this was alot better than Addendum but o well i advise you to get Storm and Addendum
0	Sadly disappointed I purchased this album with such high hopes and when I popped it in to give it a listen, I was sadly disappointed. It was not the DJ Shadow that I knew. The majority of the tracks were rap, which would have been just fine if it had been GOOD rap. It had no flow, no connection and was all over the place. I took a risk and purchased this album without looking at the reviews and I'm sorry I did. Always read the reviews!!!!
1	once again amazing If you are a fan of bonobo's work, you will definitely love this album. Recurring is mindblowing and is my favorite off this ep. Listen to the sample of recurring on amazon and be blown away. If it doesn't make you want to buy the album, you are not a fan of Bonobo. BUY this album now
0	SHE'S FINISHED...THANK GOD! I am so tired of people like Britney, who has NO TALENT, she cannot sing, making "music". Where has all the real talented artists gone? Instead of recording real HORRIBLE music, she should stay home eating like a cow, getting fatter by the minute with her useless "wannabe" husband and keep popping babies. Her 15 minutes are UP! THANK GOD! Can the real singers please come back
0	Another good bad that didn't know when to quit As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me. And they were, for 2 releases anyway. This band has run out of things to say. Dean Wareham's lyrics grow more inane with each release. Ex-Feelie Stanley Demeski is gone, replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer. Buy Lunapark or Bewitched instead...Penthouse is okay, but the decline started there
0	Ethereal and sublime goes Ricky Martin Sorry, I'm a big fan of the first two D.F. CDs. Anxiously awaited the third...bought it without hesitation...mmm, sadly disappointed. The magic the first two brought to the world is what seemed to set them apart. Cosmic, mysterious and almost spooky. So fitting to the groups name, Deep forest made me feel sensuously connected to the natural world. Comparsa on the other hand, though it must certainly fill the musicians desires to expand their creative global conquest, fans like myself feel abruptly misdirected. Harsh, tinny, fast Latin rhythems, overwhelm a majority of the otherwise liquid and textural backbeat tracks. I just can't seem to kick back and drift away with this latest endeavor. Unfortunatly, it reminds me more of a Nature Company Latin sampler (don't get me wrong, I love the works of groups such as B-Tribe). But if you're expecting more of the same to come out of this beloved duo, get ready for a hard right. Perhaps their next albumn will return to a kinder, gentler world
1	As I expected I've been waiting to hear this album for quite some time and when I finally had my chance, I was not disappointed. Such an excellently done compliation. I would recommend it to any Final Fantasy fan. I couldn't pick and choose which of the tracks are the best, as they are all amazing. Pick this up; you won't regret the purchase
1	Chilled beats with some pure style from Kev I love it when producers that have been around for a while bring out albums and rap on them. This is the case, kev has got some more bulk in the underground hip hop world now and he's got some fresh talent like Kenn Starr and Cy Young. The beats are amazingly sampled, giving real good kicking quality through your speakers. Use of classic guitar samples and piano provide a peaceful smooth sound that is unique to Kev's style. Excellent chilled stuff, buy it if you listen to the roots, slum village, or any stuff done by Jazzy Jeff since the Fresh Prince
0	Doesn't mix well These three guys are amazing musicians in their own right but this album just doesn't work. From a theory and technical standpoint it's very good (some would say brillant). If you have a background in music theory you'll probably like it a lot. There is plenty of meat to chew on when it comes to breaking down the music and understanding what they are doing. But if you have listened to The Police, Phish and Primus and you are just a big music fan then this is probably a very hard listen. It sounds like a car wreak of those three band's music and there really is nothing new. Trey's guitar work sounds like the work he did with Phish; Stewart's drums are just like The Police (more of the old Police stuff); Clay's bass is right from any Primus song. It sounds like what they did was take those aspects of their styles that would sort of fit together and just laid it out on this album. That's fine, but it's just hard not to think of Phish, The Police and Primus while listening to it. The highlight of the album IMO, is Army's on Ecstasy. It opens up kind of slow and strange then picks up in a really nice jam frenzy for Trey's solo. That sort section of the ablum works really well together. For that section, it sounds like something outside the relm of Phish, Primus and The Police.
0	Not what it used to be. Rob Zombie has lost a few steps when it comes to good music. There are only two or three tracks on here worth listening to. At least he's making good movies. I guess he spread himself too thin
1	Educated Horses - Rob Zombie Another great CD by Zombie. Every song is good; no skipping tracks on this CD
0	WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!? DUDE?!?! What happened, when i heard about a new Zombie cd i was like O YEA! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like WTF?? What happened to Hellbilly and Sinister kind of music?? I dont know what happened but, I'll admit theres a few decent songs like Let It All Bleed Out and The Scorpion Sleeps, but WTF?!?!?!?!?
0	Boring. Matter of life and death is much better. Brave new world is lame progressive rock NOT heavy metal. They don't even do a good job at making progressive rock either. Check out Therion, Iced Earth, or Dream Theater instead.
0	Incorrect interpretation of lyrics Regarding the review of Wesley Horton (Edmond, Ok) on 20 January 2005, I agree with his assertion that the subject of the song was a plane crash, not a car crash. However, part of his argument for that is based on the following lyrics; Then I looked straight at the attendant; his face is pale as it can be he bends and whispers something softly he says there's no chance for me. I think he is assuming that the attendant is a male flight attendant, which would lend support to his claim that the song is about a plane crash. At that time, however, flight attendants 1) were almost exclusively female, and 2) were referred to as "stewardesses," not "flight attendants." (The term "flight attendant" did not come into use until years after the song was written.) I think the attendant referred to in the song is likely an *ambulance* attendant (in the days before "E.M.T.'s," etc.) encountered after the crash. I agree with his assertion, but I think the support for it is based upon a faulty interpretation of the term "attendant" in this section of the lyrics
1	answer to A Music Fan Yes, Barry sang "I Go Crazy," the Paul Davis top ten from 1977-8. It is on the CD "Summer of '78." :) I hope this helps you
1	Better Than I Thought I was lucky enough meet them and see them perform and these guys are so sweet and have major talent! My faves off the album are Back Again, On and On, Suzie, Six Minutes, On My Own, and Civil Sin. The best ones i have on repeat though is Ivy Parker and Shoot Me Down. i totally love those songs cuz they're pretty deep. They have more of a Hard-Fi/Bloc Party vibe to them too. The big plus to this album to it is their unknown bonus track added onto Shoot Me Down.. that one is definately worth listenin' to
1	Review of Lean on Me-Best of Bill Withers Wanted the classic track "Ain't no sunshine" and hoped naively for more of the same on this album but got only dated soul as honestly expected. 5 Stars are deserved just for that one track
0	ok cd but still crap these guys without Max suck bad fire Derrick Green and bring back Max cavalera
0	THIS CD BLOWS You want some real metal/tribal sounds stick with Soulfly! This cd is pure garbage..
1	Hard to fault the music BUT, WHY DID COLUMBIA TAKE SO D#@* LONG TO GIVE US THE ACTUAL SET ORDER FOR PHILHARMONIC HALL? I found "the complete concert" to be unlistenable, knowing that some nitwit couldn't be bothered with treating this music with the care and attention to detail that it deserves. Flow is everything. Oh, now they care, for $139 bucks. How nice! And, for my money a box set really needs more rareties to be worth that hefty price tag. Maybe Berlin and Tokyo are supposed to be the inducement to buy, but most real fans sprung for those long ago. Am I wrong
0	Not my cup of tea ! Sorry but I don't like this, always the same distorded guitar, always the same riff, feel like it was the same song from the beginning 'til the end, poorly done
1	step up from frances the mute I thought this album was a good one. I have been listening to TMV since tremulant first came out. I thought Frances the Mute was good, but it was just too much. I loved Deloused and i think this new on is a proper mix of Deloused and Frances the Mute. TMV is still progressing with their sound and it definatley shows in this album. If you are not an avid listener and do not own Deloused you might want to pick it up and start the TMV experience there. Otherwise, I fell this is a great record. Definatley an easier listen then Frances the Mute
0	plaY One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani. Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby. Waste of mone
1	Absolutely Lovely Songs Although I am an admirer of the fact that Maria Mckee has the ability to consistently shift genres (seemingly) effortlessly from album to album, I was very pleased to discover that this album has more than a little common - in feeling - with my favorite of her recordings, Life is Sweet. Alas, the Bowie flavored guitar is gone but the tone set by the quieter tracks on that 96 album is very much accounted for. "My One True Love", "People in the Way", and "Everyone's Got a Story" are my favorites among the acoustic based gems on this strongly song oriented work. I love the fact that all of these songs have such memorable hooks, but some don't reveal themselves until a second or third listen. And don't let the title fool you, but "Sullen Soul" is the most soaringly majestic track on the record, one that just begs to be heard from a car radio on a cool summer night. So if you're on this page already take the plunge and buy the album. I know you're curious
1	Great Concert These four discs have some of the greatest music from back then. The 8 songs performed by the great Jimi Hendrix are worth it for any Jimi fan. The recording and version of his popular &quot;Purple Haze&quot; is the best I've heard. This cd is truly on of his greatest performances. The Who's performance was also awesome, for it was their first show in America. Their explosive songs amazed the crowd, and shows some of Townsend's best. These two performances are the highlights, but theyre are also many other tremendous performances with some of the best recordings I've heard
1	More Evidence Proving They Were Groovilicious If you're a Style Council fan you must own this album. Phony musicians stink when recorded live but The Style Council sounded even better live than in the studio ("Home and Abroad" is also a necessity). This disc spans several years and features covers of some soul gems along with their own songs. They groove so hard on One Nation Under a Groove, Meeting (Over) Up Yonder and Hanging On To A Memory to justify the cost. The only downers are some snippets of Mick Talbot singing lead (oy vey) and a couple mediocre tracks, but those are minor trifles with this gem for us Council fans
1	High Tide - self-titled (Repertoire) Originally released in 1970, as this was the band's follow-up to 'Space Shanties'(see my review). Also even has the very same line-up, except that group founder Tony Hill does some vocals. Just three tracks here, "Blankman Cries Again"(8:38), "The Joke"(9:29)and the epic "Saneonymous"(14:30), where Simon House's violin playing is simply superb. A decent progressive/art rock piece of work here. Most definitely an acquired taste. That's for sure
1	Possibly the best soundtrack eva This soundtrack is as good as the movie. The standout tracks are Know the Ledge, Uptown Anthem, and its goin down. This is a classic in everyway. A mix of rap/r&b, and east/west. You cant go wrong with this. My only gripe is a track or two from the movie is'nt on here. Kill a man by Cypress Hill
1	He couldve been a contender Standout tracks:ITS FUNKY ENOUGH, MIND BLOWIN, LEND ME AN EAR, LET THE BASS GO, BEAUTIFUL BUT DEADLY, THE DOC & THE DOCTOR, NO ONE CAN DO IT BETTER, WHIRLWIND PYRAMID, THE FORMULA, PORTRAIT OF A MASTERPIECE, THE GRAND FINALE(west coast version of the symphony). Filler: the commercial skits are pointless are obviously put on to take up space. Bottom Line: DOC was proof(in the 80s)that the west coast had emcees that can spit with the best of them. DOC had a killer flow and a freestyle that can only be described as crazy! The production by Dr. Dre and Yella is superb at best. Its unfortunate that he got into an accident and lost his voice and is now reduced to ghostwriting raps for Dr. Dre and Snoop(what you think I dont know?). He could have been as big as Jay-z was in the game without the commercial appeal that Jay-z has. This cd is definetely worth being in your collection
0	Why Do We Romanticize the Dead? There is probably no one in entertainment history who accomplished less alive and had more adulation dead than Jimmi Hendrix. If he is the standard, Adam Ant and Spandau Ballet should have died young- they'd be first ballot Rock N Roll Hall of Famers. WTF?
1	I don't get this release, but hey, it's Dio and it's Sabbath Instead of a new Sabbath album, we get this. Now I know a new Sabbath album is in the works, but that's just what the fans want to hear - new material. Nevertheless, Dio's greatest hits with Sabbath is still a swell purchase. Odds are if you are a true Sabbath fan, you already own all the Dio-era Sabbath, but now you can own all the goodies in one CD. Post Dio Sabbath was mediocre at best, so you can be rest assured that Dio Sabbath is as good as it was going to get. After reviewing the tracks on here, I'm a little upset that Southern Cross was not on here. If there's one song that pulls out the best from Iommi and Dio, it's that one. It's got edge, balls, and guts. However, the rest of the tracks are pure classics and definitely do not disappoint. So, if you're a fan, you'll probably by it cause you like to collect things. If you already own the previous albums, the choice is yours. The only discernable difference that I can tell is the obvious production value. Mob Rules sounds horrible on its own, and the few tracks from Mob Rules will sound great on this disc
1	Once Again, Bell Delivers I'll have to admit I steered a bit clear of Joshua Bell in the early years of his career. My aversion wasn't based on his musical abilities. He was one of the performers that a few music industry publicity people decided would appeal to a younger audience so he was dressed as a teenaged heart throb that seemed to belong on the cover of a magazine geared toward junior high school girls than a lover of good, serious music. I think I resented shameless attempts to lure a "younger crowd" into concert halls to hear a symphony. I was young at the time and it didn't matter to me whether the guy on the cover was wearing a tux and might be a bit overweight or if he looked like the kid next door or the woman was slightly flawed wearing a gown or if she looked like a sex symbol. All I cared about was the music and I responded by not purchasing any of the various wunderkind releases and Joshua Bell was in this category. Of course I could boycott the recordings but I couldn't ignore the likes of Joshua Bell. He was always on television, performing with symphony orchestras (classical music radio stations still broadcast a plethora of concerts at the time) and I think only the most closed minded listeners could deny his talent. Since that time I've seen him perform and what I've found is an amiable performer with great talent who knows people that while people are paying to hear him play, the performance has to be about the music and not the performer and even if he hasn't aged, at least according to the cover photos on his recordings, he has matured as a performer. His technique is still evolving which could one day earn him a place with some of the great violinists (remember he's only in his thirties, he still has quite a career ahead of him), and he's able to perform some of the works of the greet classical composers and pieces with popular appeal without getting gimmicky. VOICE OF THE VIOLIN is a collection of vocal pieces arranged fop the violin. Each of the arrangements works well for violin. The challenge is performing them with the same passion we are used to when we hear them performed by vocalists. Just about every tenor and soprano of note has performed and recorded Schubert's "Ave Maria." Massenet's "Porquoi Me Reveller" from WERTHER is a showstopper that was a favorite of tenors from Caruso to Pavarotti. Fans of Fredericka Von Stade and Renee Fleming have grown to love "Song to the Moon" from RUSALKA. We've grown accustomed to the greats singing many of the works on this collection with beauty and gusto. Chances are expectations are high for anyone familiar with these works. Bell delivers. He evokes the emotions of each piece and in a way his violin does sing as he performs. This can be tricky. So often vocal works, especially those from the operatic stage, don't adapt all that well to instrumental transcriptions and it is the rare instrumental performer that can do justice to the works, but Joshua Bell seems to in this recording. Fans of Joshua Bell do not need to be convinced of the merits of this recording. Some may feel this is not a serious enough recording but I think most people who enjoy good music will appreciate Bell's artistry and the beautiful melodies are sure to give listeners hours of pleasure.
0	Not good at all! When will joshua bell learn to record real repetoire, instead of these pseudo pieces transcribed for voice? First off, the pieces aren't that beautiful, and joshua bell cannot sustain any of the pieces... Just because it is a "famous" name does not mean it is good! Listen to james ehnes, a 100x better violins
0	expecting great memories, but what did i get? i ordered this release last week from amazon and couldn't wait to hear it, but when i got it yesterday, i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd, instead of getting 15 tracks of music like i was promised, i got 10 tracks and 44 minutes of spanish ballads! oh, my lord, what in the world happened!? well, i guess you can't hear 'em all, can ya? i'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time. oh, by the way, the one star is not for the flirts music, for that is 5 star material anyway, but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music
1	awesome!!! I was born in 1984, I'm young I know. But I grew up listening to bands like guns-n-roses, poison, ozzy osbourne, whitesnake, and so on, because of my dad. I grew out of that phase, got in with the boyband thing, until the late 90's when i re-discovered the great music that was the 80's. I fell in love with the power ballads, I can't begin to explain when listening to a great song like that feels like. Its completely awesome, and VH1 has done a great job diggin out the good music and the music that should still be, not the crap they are playing now.
1	Wonderful music Another review of a Govi CD that I should have submitted years ago. This CD opened my ears and mind to a whole new spectrum of guitar based music that caused me spend big $$$$ to upgrade my mid-fi stereo system to high end; a decision that I'll never regret. Maybe better than any other Govi release, this CD showcases the widest range of his immense musical talents. The softly played songs are full, detailed, open, and introspective while "Viva La Vida" makes me feel like I am riding a galloping horse, in the southwest desert, at full speed while enjoying a day of playing hookey from work. The end result of this fullfilling music is not only the great sound but the warm/happy feelings that the music generates. George M -- Phoenix, AZ
0	Average Average Singer with below average arrangements on often sung standards. I was expecting at least some re-harmonization on these tunes but very much straight from the fakebook kind changes. The horn lines were not too exciting. Well....overall, very clean and straight
0	"Super Audio" format will not play in your CD player Amazon ships this CD in a proprietary Sony format. It will not play in your player or on your computer. Amazon does not list this in the description! I found out the hard way why a really popular jazz album is selling for only $7
0	Disappointed because... The reason I purchased this particular CD was for the title song. However, I did not appreciate the fact that someone dubbed in an introduction by John Wayne that begins just before the song starts. What was the point of that? Who wants to hear John Wayne speak every time one plays the song
1	oh my this woman has such soul and fire in her, especially for appearing so demurre in photos ... i am in total aw
0	Just not the same If you're into classical music, you know how different the same symphony performed by two different conductors and orchestras can sound. Same here. If you really love this score like I do, I think you'll be disappointed in the difference in sound compared to the original. I'd give this a higher rating if it was the only version available. But since the original is available on CD, there's no reason to buy this imposter. There's only 5 minutes more from Lion in Winter, and the mini-Mary score is nothing special
0	nay sayer I think it is tragic that such an excellent intstrumental performance should be marred by some very unpleasant vocalizing. I can't understand why so many fans take it for granted. I would rate Keith Jarrett very high as a pianist; in the same league as Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea; if only he could keep his mouth shut while he plays his pianistic miracle
1	The Reason We Listen to Radio Gloria's first greatest hits collection flows like the river wild, an incredibly enjoyable mix of emotional and heartfelt pop ballads and Miami club scene dance songs akin to having special access to the best radio station in the world. This collection of pop hits is easy to listen to and hard to turn off, which is exactly what pop music was intended to be. This 14 song compilation truly is the best of Gloria's radio friendly mix of Cuban rhythms and vocal honesty. You'll recognize every song here, which is quite a tribute in and of itself. From infectious dance songs to powerful heartbreak we get it all. There was always an emotional honesty in Gloria Estefan's vocals that is missing among the new wave of pop stars. Talent and range are not the same thing as honesty and integrity. There is a reason Gloria Estefan has such a special relationship with her fans and has managed to have such staying power in an industry where a new pop princess comes along every five minutes. You can hear that reason even in some of the earlier radio hits. That honesty reached its zenith on Gloria's final selection here, "Always Tomorrow." THE HAPPY DANCE SONGS CONGA -- 1, 2, 3 -- RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YOU -- GET ON YOUR FEET -- GO AWAY These songs truly capture the feel of Miami at night, their fun mix of Cuban rhythms infectious. No one has ever done this kind of song better than Gloria Estefan. Emilio Estefan's attention to every detail in the production of each song turn these dance club party songs into glittering images of pink flamingos, sandy beaches, and exotic cars. Listening to these songs is like watching the now famous opening salvo of images from Miami Vice. These wonderful songs we all remember are the next best thing to being at an open air Cuban club on a warm Miami night during summer. THE HEARTFELT SONGS OF LOVE WORDS GET IN THE WAY -- CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM YOU -- ANYTHING FOR YOU -- HERE WE ARE -- DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU -- I SEE YOUR SMILE These beautiful ballads are no less special simply because they found their way to radio and were big hits. Sometimes there is a reason songs are popular with everyone. No one ever gave a song more emotional honesty than Gloria does. Each selection here, whether it is of love lost, love clinging to survival, or love remembered, has a touching truth in its lyrics and the manner in which Gloria Estefan delivers them. "Don't Wanna Lose You" and the very sad and wistful "I See Your Smile" are of particular note, lingering in our hearts long after the song has ended. The beautiful "Words Get In the Way" is like an anthem for anyone who has ever loved someone so. Gloria would record a live version of this song in Miami and donate all the proceeds of that beautiful and special mix only available on the single for South Florida victims of Hurricane Andrew. SPECIAL SONGS CHRISTMAS THROUGH YOUR EYES -- COMING OUT OF THE DARK -- ALWAYS TOMORROW "Christmas Through Your Eyes" has a wonderful and nostalgic feel; Gloria sings about the innocence and optimism we had as kids that we would love to feel once again. It is a very pretty song that will have you thinking about how you once felt also, back when everyone seemed kind. "Coming Out of the Dark" and "Always Tomorrow" are inspirational songs born of a near tragedy when Gloria was injured in an accident and broke her back. She could easily have lost her life, and it would be many months before she would be her old self, both physically and emotionally. "Always Tomorrow" is especially poignant. No one can listen to this song and not think about the life they have, and wonder if they are spending enough time enjoying it. Gloria's discovery that it could end at any moment and her reaction to it is truly heartrending. It is deeply felt and inspirational, and quite appropriately, concludes this most fantastic collection of music, which covered not only many years of our lives, but the emotions we felt along the journey. The liner notes, in addition to containing the lyrics to all the songs, have some wonderful pictures of Gloria. The cover was shot by photographer Alberto Tolot at The Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. The photographs inside were taken by Antoine Verglas at The Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. IN SUMMATION The music is great, the production smooth, and Gloria's emotional vocals always perfect. She always made this look so easy that she sometimes didn't get credit for how difficult creating good pop music can be. Husband Emilio, a terrific artist in his own right, always manages to give just the right production to a tune, enhancing the flavor of a song while not overpowering Gloria's emotional delivery. These hits are the perfect blend of popularity and artistry. In turns uplifting, exciting, and heartbreaking, "Gloria Estefan: Greatest Hits" reminds us what was good about listening to radio during the 1980's and early 1990's. This was the culmination of Gloria's dream. We can be glad that the dream continued, Gloria taking her music in different directions as radio changed. She found other venues, such as the Olympics and films to augment the occasional dance club favorite. And her Spanish music shows her growth over the years as an artist. There would be a second "Greatest Hits" collection, thanks to those different directions Gloria's music would take, but anyone wanting to know just what is so special about her, and why she has lasted so long, must have this first one. It is, for want of a better phrase, the music of our lives
1	Lost Biker Psychedelia Of The Highest Form Dragonfly was actually a band called The Legend who's debut album (on which they weren't allowed to play or contribute songs) was somewhat butchered by their record company. So they decided to pursue other interests. Under a different name (association with that Legend album wasn't gonna happen), they recorded this. They didn't have the best sound quality (crackles and pops still cover the sound on CD), but they had enough technology to mess around. Throughout this album, the track suddenly jumps into backward recording, slows down suddenly, or dissipates altogether. The boys explode into ridiculous giggles, get wasted by a moaning trombone, and turn into a giant rolling ball of mung at the end before returning to form. Along the way, we have some good songs. "Blue Monday" opens the album with a moan of "Oooh my God.." then harsh chords, before rhythm guitarist Gene cracks his throat in anger. "Enjoy Yourself" is bouncy, thoughtful psychedelia, "Crazy Woman" sounds very 60s and somewhat Moby Grape. "To Be Free" is a good bit of yearning and hope: the classic 60s message. There's just all kinds of good stuff here. The drums are fierce and the fuzz-toned lead guitar is excellent. There's some heavy solos on this album. Great performing. Gene's vocals sometimes sound like Keith Relf of the Yardbirds and sometimes like Jack Bruce of Cream. It's forgotten, and that's a pity. Take an acid trip ito the good ol' days of heavy psychedelic hard rock. It'll blow you away
0	Mostly good material, but little value added. "The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors. Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles. But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end. The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong. I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece. "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing. Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one
1	Diecast and this album deserves full appreciation First of all, I'm very disappointed by the people who have given this MASTERPIECE their sad, dry, garbage filled reviews. Now getting back to how BRILLIANT this album is. If you are into hardcore/heavy, aggressive music combined with strong, roaring but mature, melodic vocals blended with powerful riffs and drumming, you will love this album! It's a mixture of Soilwork, Shadows Fall, Dry Kill Logic and All That Remains, which is what makes this album so consistent UNLIKE most noise junk these days that sound all repetitive and gets boring in no time. If you like these bands or their type of music, get this album and feed your ears. Every song is absolutely fantastic. My personal favourites (in order) are: Sacrifice, Pendulum and Rebirth. The sampling provided on this site isn't really helpful so you may purchase/download these tracks to get a complete idea of how GREAT I mean they are and strong chances are if you are really 'into music' and not just sticking to the mainstream rubbish, this band is definitely worth giving a try and good reviews for their excellent efforts and hardwork.
1	Quite possibly, the greatest album of all time .... period As a musician and buyer of well over 2000 albums from every genre, collected over a period of 35 years, this remains my favorite album by anyone at anytime. IMHO, it is the most "complete" collection of songs that anyone has ever committed to vinyl and, given the state of todays recording industry, is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. An amazing body of work that should grace the collection of anyone who considers themselves a serious music fan
0	Weak, noncommital, and boring In 1994, Morgan Heritage released MIRACLE, its lackluster debut LP, and followed it three years later with the superb PROTECT US JAH. Since then, the band has established a reputation for melodious, but uninspired, crossover albums that seem only to appeal to listeners with a casual interest in reggae music. For a band that began its career with glaringly mediocre music, coming "full circle" is nothing to celebrate. In this latest offering, the band reasserts their formula of "safe" pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in the North American and British markets. Like previous albums, FULL CIRCLE meanders from R&B ("Enough Is Enough"; "Your Best Friend") to watered-down roots ("Propoganda"; "So Much to Come"), with a handful of dancehall tracks bolstered by guest appearances. Between the electric guitar riffs and the appearance of Bounty Killer on the final cut, it's obvious that the producers are trying desperately to reach the broadest possible audience. As Rastafari reggae artists, Morgan Heritage's generic message and nonprovocative image stands in stark contrast to the raw energy and fervor of such contemporaries as Lutan Fyah and Capleton. Sadly, both FULL CIRCLE and Heritage's recent live performances stand as further evidence that the band isn't interested in producing anything other than slick, commercial, feel-good Jah music. This is unfortunate, because the Morgans are talented vocalists. Most tragic of all, however, is that the only time Heritage is provocative is when they're preaching intolerance toward Christians and homosexuals in their lyrics and concert interludes. Despite its stylistic and lyrical inconsistency, the album is not without its strong points; highlights include the catchy, uptempo "Hail Up the Lion" and the dancehall remix of "U've Got Me". Even so, there isn't nearly enough substance here to keep you interested long, even if you happen to love the album initially. Expect copies of FULL CIRCLE to accumulate in used record stores over the next six months
1	Mo' and Betta!!! If you enjoyed "33-1/3" by the Frank and Joe Show, you will doubtless enjoy their sophomore offering, "66-2/3". It has all of the consummate musicianship, chemistry and inventive inspiration as the first CD. And it's every bit as accessible and enjoyable! Very highly recommended!!
1	Fat Possum Primer Outstanding sampler from Nortern Mississippi Hill Country Blues label Fat Possum. Much prefer this sampler to the first one. This has that gritty country blues feel with many songs feeling like they were recorded in a leaky basement(and many were). Standouts are the two RL Burnside tracks: "Goin down South" is a staple of his music and the version included of "Walkin Blues" is top notch. The previously unreleased "I Feel Good Again" by Junior Kimbrough and Charlie Feathers is worth more than the low 4.99 price to buy this. The Asie Payton tracks are both stunners and Paul Wine Jones and Super Chikan add some diversity in style with there numbers
0	piece of foam Tracks on this CD are very easily consumable. Two kisses the first song sounds very catchy but I don' t think it' s music. I don' t think he'd have a chance in the US or the UK music markets
1	great CD!! Solid CD - the highlight is Candles. Buy it

1	When African-American Singing moved African-Americans After sampling this new Shanachie product "When Gospel Was Gospel", I can testify that this is African-American singing to the "nth" power. This style of "full-throated" singing is seldom heard anymore because African-Americans either prospered after the Civil Rights movement or fell to the seductive power of "Hip Hop" genre that captured the heart, mind and spirit as Classical Gospel once did. This music started in the 1930's when African-Americans were in their "Great Depression". And African-Americans have a Ph.d in suffering and hard times. This music is a testament to our ability to "ground" ourselves in a strange land of North America and plant our beliefs, hopes, and aspirations in a musical form. I am always impressed with these singers who have went to Heaven. Each one has something to offer new generations of singers in tone, drama, and breadth of personality. I recommend this CD to those who are struggling to find meaning in their lives. Those who are looking for excitement and surprise. African-Americans know about the negativities of life and we know how to create "Joy that comes to our mornings" Rev. Khalil Canady M.div age 27
0	Perfectly Dreadful If celebrated film director Ed Wood (Plan 9 From Outer Space) made an album, it would sound like this. The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock. Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity. If the phrase, "So bad it's good," is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy. (Warning: Do Not Operate Heavy Equipment While Listening To This CD.)
1	Quirky Melancholy Brilliance Brad Mehldau first came to my attention with his percussive yet lyrical take on Radiohead's "Paranoid Android" on his album "Largo." I thought it was stunning, ambitious, and fresh. It gave me new respect for this song from Radiohead's 90s masterpiece "OK Computer"; "Paranoid Android" is a tripartate "Day in the Life" for a sadder wiser time more than 30 years after the Beatles disbanded. Here Mehldau's breakthrough piece is expanded to 20 minutes in a live format uinaccompanied by his trio. It still has riveting moments, but is less impressive than his version on "Largo." There is plenty here to make up for that. Nick Drake, a 60s/70s folkie rediscovered recently through a Volkswagon commercial which featured his hypnotic "Pink Moon," gets the Mehldau treatment twice. Drake's already jazzy "Riverman" is expanded on, deconstructed, explored. His mysterious "Things behind the Sun" opens the album nicely. Mehdlau's idiosyncrasies seem under control at first but increase as the album proceeds like a fidgeting child still for only for a few minutes at a time. This is just fine as the quirky jazz pianist covers another quirky jazz pianist: Thelonious Monk. Jazz standards are another strength of Mehldau's since they need his strange flourishes and dense pounding chords to attain new life. THe choices of Monk, Gershwin, Drake, and Radiohead continue to Mehldau tradition of being a liason between traditional and avant-garde jazz. This live album, with its enthusiatic Japanese audience, requires patience with its long meanderings, which are sometimes too far from the melody he's interpreting and just generally overlong. My four-star review is to say: There's more here interesting than distracting
0	Another of the greats has degenerated into total pop garbage Back in the beginning of the extreme music genesis, these guys were one of the pioneers of extreme music. They certainly weren't any of the forms of extreme metal and they certainly weren't punk. Unfortunately, they were put into the alternative category which was a catch-all for music that was basically pop while supposedly rejecting the "mainstream sound". That's right The Butthole Surfers were stuck in the category that cursed the world with Nirvana / Nine Inch Nails / Ministry / Smashing Pumpkins garbage. Oh, that reminds me, it cursed the 80s with all those hideous Sub-Pop label bands. Still there were a few "alternative" bands that were quite good. Only the Surfers and Big Black come to mind though. Their live shows were incredible. Flashing movie clips flashed strange scenes in the back ground including sex change operation footage. The singer constantly lit his hand on fire for some reason (as if it were a big dangerous stunt), naked women danced on stage, and a certain song they used a huge tuba. Their two best albums were Hairway to Steven and Locust Abortion Technician but some of the earlier ones could be considered as good as these two. There song styles varied from song to song. They would have crazy fast songs such as Human Cannonball or really slow drugged out songs such as 22 going on 23 with a depressed radio talk show clip played in the background. They would also utilize oriental sounds modified in their own weird style on the classic Kuntz(spelling). We also got the weird rantings on "Johnny Smokes" who was a "crippled midget lesbian boy who stood ten foot tall WITH A KNIFE!" Well, they got to be pretty popular and appeared on the alternative music fest tour Lollapalooza and soon after actually got signed to a major label. The last I heard probably over 10 years old was some songs off of the major label release "Independent Worm Saloon". They had seriously sold out their style degenerating in a more acceptable mainstream sound. I hadn't paid attention for these many years but recently checked out this Weird Revolution. This has got to be one of the most extreme sell-out jobs ever. I can't think of a worse bit of conforming to please mainstream record labels hoping for success. I have seen plenty and most of them quite bad but I honestly can't think of any that tops this. This is the kind of pumping technopop you see in bad movies. What happened? I am not aware of how popular these guys have become or not but it is one of the saddest falls of a great band I have ever known
1	Best Breakup Album Ever Just a short commentary - Written after a painful divorce, "Bare" is a haunting summary of the many emotions that come crashing in following a breakup. Musically, the songs have all the pop expertise you'd expect from AL - combined with lyrics that lay bare the pain and hope of starting over again. Buy it. Buy it for your friends who've been left behind by a lover or a husband, buy it for yourself. I keep it in my album rotation for sad days
1	When Annie bares it all... I've been a fan of Annie for quite a while, and this album sticks to me the most other than her previous releases (don't know if it's because this is the first album of Annie that I've bought, or because I have personal recollection to this album -- maybe both..) Anyway, I have to say that this album is a rare album to be found in nowadays highly commercialized music industry. In this album (which sadly is Annie's most unknown/unheard album), Annie Lennox sheds her deepest soul and her truths, unabashedly. I can understand why a lot of people dislike/hate this album while they are fans of "Diva"...this album ain't no "Diva"... Annie's life has changed throughout the 11 years span between the relase of "Diva" and "Bare", so it's kind of funny to me people hating this record because Annie is considered to be "a whining 50-years-old woman" (How cruel, isn't it?) What's more personal is that Lennox wrote all the tracks herself, making this a highly original, innovative, fresh yet revealing and honest record..Gone are the 80's/90's synthesizer sounds, replaced by keyboards-oriented sounds. All the tracks are about being hurt/sad yet also surrendering like the melodic "A Thousand Beautiful Things", "The Saddest Song I've Got" (indeed, her saddest song), the wonderfully layered "Honestly" and the dance influenced "Bitter Pill" Her anger and pain can be seen on songs like "Pavement Cracks" , "Erased" and "Twisted" where on "The Hurting Time" Annie gets wise with the lyrics: "So tell me what they day brings/ Has it lost its thrill? / Are you still searching, hoping for that empty space to fill? / And everything you turn to / Is like a mirror on the shelf/ And the one that you're blaming is yourself.." wrapped in jazzy sounds, creating a highly spiritual listening. "Loneliness" is the return to the 80's rock sounds, with heart wrenching lyrics : "I've got a longing that's hard to find/Won't give me no peace of mind/Something that I've lived with all along/Days and weeks and months and years/ Filling in the time my dear/ But somehow I still keep on going strong", where we can see her sadness but also willing to be strong, facing the truth. The last track, "Oh God (Prayer)", is a short sad song, filled with questions to God, soaring her pain: "If you can see me/ If you can hear me/ I know that I can't be that strong/ 'cause Everything I ever did went wrong"... All that being said, this is the album that you will listen to over and over again while going through a rough time...it's about releasing your pain, sadness and anger, and also willing to be strong again...Listening to this album is not just listening, it's an experience which we can relate to and learn from
0	NO NO NO NO Two Words for this bulls**t they call an album: STRAIGHT GARBAGE!!!!!!!! What were they thinking. Bone Thugs are my favorite rap group of all time, but what the hell is this? Every track is horrible. They could've left this CD at the record company. If I could, I would give this CD 0 stars
1	Excellent I really like this CD, I am not a hard core fan of the group, I just happen to grow up in the 80's. But this CD is excellent and I recommend it.
1	CHRISTMAS MEMORIES THE ANDY WILLIAMS CHRISTMAS ALBUM BELONGS IN EVERYONES'S CHRISTMAS MUSIC COLLECTION. IT IS FILLED WITH TRADITIONAL & FUN CHRISTMAS SONGS, AND FULL OF HOLIDAY WARMTH. ANDY'S VOICE FILLS EACH SONG WITH MEANING. IT'S A GREAT QUALITY CD FOR THE PRICE
1	Art Of The Theremin This recording is the definitive standard by which all other theremin recordings will be judged. To put it succinctly, it is marvelous! Howard Mossman Swarthmore, Pa
0	Fool me once, shame on you ...This had the SACD logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed, implied that this was in 5:1. Shame on you. It is in stereo. I have always enjoyed this album that came out when I was in high school and have a stereo copy already. When I saw it in the SACD section of Best Buy, I thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound! It was a severe disappointment to see that it says Stereo in small letters on the back after I had opened it already. If I hadn't opened it, I would have returned it. Why bother putting out a SACD if it is only in stereo??
1	Good God! Wow.....Sam Popat must have been hurt a lot in life, because his selection of music is so personal and painful, yet exquisite and beautiful....thank you, thank you Sam for once again breathing life back in to this collection, this is so much like the first three releases of the series, and if I daresay...TOPS THEM! if you want music that is intimate personal and you can chill to, do not pass this up
0	Why listen to it for free when you can pay for it? ClearChannel strikes again! First they bought up all the rights to the great classic rock bands music; then they saw to it that any NEW music those bands recorded would never see the light of day (BTO, Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, and many others are still making great records, but ClearChannel radio stations will not play them); now, they're spitting out their own Digital K-Tel compilations. To their credit, this is a pretty good batch of music. It's missing a few great bands, simply because those are the bands that didn't sell their souls over to ClearChannel to pay off the dealers and bookies. Rush, Zeppelin, Floyd, The Stones, Springsteen, AC/DC, all not here because they held on to the rights to their music. Smart move guys. They can still get their new material played. So, if you live in a rural area where the nearest classic rock radio station just doesn't come in to good, pick this up. Otherwise, you really don't have to look to far to find this stuff, and ClearChannel really doesn't need anymore of your money to encourage them to continute bastardizing the music industry
1	Very Nice! I have been listening to this album for two Christmas seasons and never seem to tire of it. The instrumental pieces are very well done, beautifully providing delicate, intricate harmonies. The vocal numbers are equally well done. There is a nice selection of songs, some familiar to the modern listener, and some providing a good introduction to medieval music. This is Christmas music for all ages
0	It's Alright in the Monkey House These guys have the corner on strange listen to me if you are curious music that most of the time makes you wonder if it makes sense, or if you are really entertained. I bought it for the theme song from Veronica Mars, We Used to be Friends, which is a great tune. I find it hard to find anthing else that matches up to it. I have muddled through it, but wish I would have found it elsewher
1	Maria, you still haven't landed I absolutely LOVE this album -- favorite of the year. I see the user reviews are all over the board. I guess I am not surprised. I was taken aback by her prior album, Life is Sweet. Maybe I was expecting something more like her earlier work then, but I got into it over time and I still love it. So I think I was more open minded and trusting when High Dive came out after so many years, having no idea what to expect. I can't say I love every track on the second half of the disk, but there's just so much that is GREAT and it is so unbelievably ambitious. Just a huge record. Thank you, Maria
0	It doesn't work. Heifetz is the supreme violinist of the 20th century. He was without a peer in his class when it comes to Romantic pieces. These sonatas and partitas are not quite right for him. His approach was not of the usual high standard that he set in his other recordings
1	This "Oldie" is definitely a "GOODIE" !!! I was familiar with a few songs by Gene Pitney that I include in my favorite "oldies". After listening to the entire CD, I am impressed by the range of talent by Mr. Pitney and how many fantastic songs he recorded. As far as the price; I feel I received more than I paid for. This CD is a "MUST HAVE" and would be a compliment to any home collection
1	Just great. This is a great CD. Great songs, sung by a great artist. Good selection. Good sound quality. This CD is worth every cent you pay for it and if you are 40 or older this CD should not miss in your collection. It will bring back wonderful memories of a wonderful era
0	Wildly Overrated! The fact that as of this writing 20+ copies are available new and used at big discounts might be a warning sign. The big-concept selling point here is that on this album PWR was finally freed to be his highly original self,and played tunes by Ornette Coleman,Coltrane,and Monk (along with his more standard fare). However,on these supposed epochal encounters with the ultra-moderns,he does little more than state the themes as written,with no improvisation at all on two and minimal improvisation on the third. Critics whom I trust praised this highly,and I bought it on their recommendation--my mistake; don't make it
1	Jusst looking at the controversy ... generated in these reviews tells me there's something important in this album. Here's what I think ... Sometimes you hear a tune and you say, "Wow, what a great copy of the Beatles." A clear example of this is the Knickerbockers' Sixties tune "Lies." A great tune, upbeat pop all the way, with no pretensions to anything but turning a buck with a beat. God bless ya, my boys. To my knowledge, the Knickerbockers are memorialized in the room at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame devoted to one hit wonders. But the song is still a great copy of the sound that made the Beatles the dominant force in a half century of pop music. Anyone who wants to debate this point can meet me at the side of the podium after the lecture. But this album, "Bellybutton" by Jellyfish, is a subtle, loving, and cleverly complete tribute to the Beatles. In its 10 songs, Jellyfish captures virtually every era and accomplishment of the Beatles, from thier earliest days of raw enthusiasm/talent/new harmonies, through the psychedelic growth years, to the era when the inexorable forces of the Beatles' unprecedented fame were driving them apart even while they made thier most innovative and insightful music. Even this album's artwork is a subtle evocation of the now-classic Sergeant Pepper cover. Jellyfish members have clearly studied music of virtually all genres (OK, I don't think I hear any C&W in this recording), and the mix of influences in truly entertaining. The songs are each little magic showcases for the impressive talents of this now-gone band. Every one tells a story based on conditions and emotions -- heartbreak, shame, addiction, loss, longing. The musicianship is outstanding. Arrangements pay tribute to the kind of work that made George Martin a vital element of the Beatles' success. I like the album a lot, even though it is more than 15 years old. I keep returning to its spot on my iPod. It never fails to snap me out of a bad mood and run me through a gamut of emotions in a short 45 minutes. It's a great example of why music is so important to so many people
0	i didn't believe a word of it...hated the `tunes'...was thoroughly bored There's a myth going around that Jarvis Cocker is some amazing poet, immortalising the average and championing the silent kitchenette majority. There is an equally prevalent myth that he tapped into a musical vein that discovered something new in old synthesized sounds and cheesily orchestrated compositions. In actual fact he both is, and has done, neither. This record is consequently as bland as it deserves to be. It is truly a non-event and should be avoided without giving it a second thought. The observations Cocker is lauded for could be written by any 15 yr old public school boy who has watched Coronation Street or The Royle Family on UK TV--possibly more authentically and possibly better. Musically it's pretty much the same deal. You feel like asking him "what do you listen to for pleasure, Jarvis? It certainly can't be hackneyed crap like this." The whole thing sounds like early Scott Walker trying to do a number on a modern northern city...pretending, sub Joyce, that he casting it into an immortal and tragic frame. The problem is that Jarvis has no muse. There is certainly no Bloom to lift the themes and you're left with a sense of dull ideas penned on the back of write-up from Q magazine. I'm sure this CD will appeal to someone somewhere. Good luck to them and bon voyage. Perhaps I'm just too bored with mediocre efforts to lift my attention and join the party. Jo Whiley can probably fill-in for me while I'm away doing something more interesting.
0	Boring Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all! Not Disney's best effort, but it will be a cash cow. Visually interesting on stage, but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line. Kids will love it
1	asdf lo fi, futuristic production and real raw lyrics about slangin white abound in this release, which suprisingly happens to contain just as much style as it does substance in a lyrically taboo zone which encompasses such retards as young jeezy and rick ross... these two do it well and are two of the more superior mainstream emcees in the game today... the production is also different and fresh... listen and weep..
1	A Blues Timemachine Absolutely one of the finest live albums of all times. I bought this album because it was listed as one of the top 100 guitar albums of all time in Guitar Player Magazine. You get lightning in a bottle here with BB King at the height of his powers. The audience is alive and you can feel the young woman hyperventilating and swooning to BB King's rendition of some blues classics. His voice is flawless, still velvety smooth, especially when compared with later live albums by BB King. There is the perfect mixture of BB King's introductions or setups for each tune, guitar, vocals and audience reaction. The sound is immaculate, balanced and clear. His guitar playing is efficient and his timing is perfect. It makes you wonder why more recent "live albums" lack the spontaneity and quality found in this recording. The only regret is the album is not longer.
1	Back when the music was real This cd takes me back a lot even though I had previously never heard it before. I instantly started to compare it with other groups like Trixter and Warrant. I so love the fact that I can explore music on Amazon that I would otherwise not be aware of. This group should have been a lot more successful and well known but however they brought out this album at a bad time for rock when things were turning to grunge music and Nirvana
0	Don't Be Distracted I've listened to this CD several times, and after reading the other reviews here, I just don't hear what is so great about this music. This guy does not impress me whatsoever as a trumpet player. He does not really PLAY the trumpet, he just toots some notes over some beats that some would consider "funk". The only stand-out tracks here are "On The One" and "Family", and they are just mediocre at best. Everything else here is just a couple of 2-minute "snippets" and some Parliament-Funkadelic-inspired pseudo-funk jams. This stuff sounds like this guy got bored one Saturday afternoon and decided to go into his garage and make some noise with his kids. For some real trumpet and real contemporary jazz-funk, I recommend Patches Stewart and Joey Sommerville. Check out their CD's, you won't be disappointed
0	OK But not as good as ones I bought in the past This CD was somewhat of a dissapointment. Wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Was okay but definitely not one of my better Christmas CD's
0	Worst choice of CD I've ever bought!! Having spent the better part of my life involved in the music business, I can honestly say (my opinion only of course) that this is the WORST piece of plastic I've ever purchased. This is the laziest, most careless, most arrogant album I've ever heard!! I feel as though I'm on "Candid Camera" and everyone who saw me purchase this album is on the floor laughing at me -- laughing the hardest is probably John Waite!
1	Sisters Rock Out! The Ross Sisters-Amber, Sarah & Julia- who make up EVERLIFE- rock out on their self- titled CD ! Bright, sharp & upbeat these girls outdo most of the young male rock bands around today. I enjoy every track on the CD but especially enjoy What I Like About You, Now or Never, and the ballad Angels Cry. The latter song- harkens back to their Christian rock roots and is very uplifting and inspiring! It should be noted that the girls write many of the songs on the CD and play guitars as well. This is not a manufactured act but a real band! This CD deserves to be a big hit- buy it now
1	Exciting, moving, beautiful, energetic, heart-felt, fantastic... What more can I add? Cecilia Bartoli just "does it" for me almost every time. She is just fantastic in my books. I love her dearly. She can give one an adrenalin rush with her bravura singing and then break one's heart with her pathos. This is a superb collection of Baroque arias from "almost" operas! ;-)) I also liked the cheeky and none-too-subtle references to La Dolce Vita on cover and the images inside the disc. Nice to see an opera singer with a playful sense of humour! I am listening to this disc as I write this review and all I can say is that I love this disc and it is clearly one of the best Signorina Bartoli has released, although I like all of her recordings. Listen to track 12 and you will buy this disc. More, please! PS: How about DECCA getting Cecilia Bartoli and Andreas Scholl together for a musical project? I'd love to see two of my favourite singers together on the one disc. PSPS: If you like Opera Proibita, buy Andreas Scholl's Arcadia and Arias for Senesino, too!
1	Miles playing REAL JAZZ This 1961 club date was Miles' first ever authorized live recording and it features a quintet Miles was to discard a couple of years later in favor of a newer, younger group. The music of the later group (featuring Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams) was an experimental group that played around with timbral innovations, unusual harmonies, atonality and rapid tempo changes, leading all five members of the group to later experiments in jazz-rock fusion. The music they produced was inaccessible to many and its status as true "jazz" has justifiably been questioned by those who believe jazz must be fundamentally rooted in swing and blues. The jazz status of this 1961 group, however, cannot be questioned. It is arguably the last true mainstream jazz group that Miles ever led and these recordings show the group at its best. For me, the highlights of this set include Cole Porter's "All of You" in which the talented and underrated tenorman, Hank Mobley, delivers a magnificent, powerful blues-oriented solo that upstages the understated Miles himself! Mobley's characteristic tone is unmistakable. Miles' own "So What" is even more impressive here than the famous version on the Kind of Blue album. The modal song is taken at a brisk tempo and Miles' solo is incisive, hard-driving, and completely assured - a masterful performance. Mobley's solo is also a fine one, and pianist Wynton Kelly delivers a typically fleet-fingered, exciting solo of his own. Miles' mastery of melancholia shows on Monk's "Round Midnight" which Miles performs brilliantly and movingly, though the other solos are not as noteworthy. Miles again shows his lyrical mastery on the lovely romantic Johnny Mercer ballad, "I Thought About You". Backing Miles, Mobley and Kelly are Miles' longtime bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb, both of whom are consistently solid. If musical experimentation in the free jazz or fusion vein is what you like, then this album will probably seem unprogressive and unappealing to you. If, however, you prefer the mainstream jazz tradition as represented by the likes of Armstrong, Tatum, Parker, Monk, Gillespie, and Rollins, then you won't likely be disappointed by these performances. They represent one of Miles' best and last contributions to the mainstream jazz tradition.
0	Save your money..........or get it used. I am a die hard Celine fan and I got this cd for my birthday...I have one word to describe it BORING. This is for little babies and their mothers. So I have it because I have it. Beautiful Boy is a good song though. If you are a die-hard Celine Fan you might want to get it used of save your money....luckily I didn't spend a cent on it.
0	H0-Hum For Christmas For a 2-CD set this should have about twice as many songs on it with a ton more atrists. Good stuff, but not enough of it
0	Where to begin... The "stick to Fallout Boy"-esque comments are just silly. If you want to listen to noise for nearly an hour go ahead. This is one of the worst LPs ever recorded. All I could think of when listening to this CD was a hilarious wiki page mocking a fictional industrial band from Finland, who hide behind fire hydrants and record the sound of dogs urinating, among other things that don't belong in a review. But then I guess I'm just too much of a pea brain to appreciate the depth of this follow-up. Please. Get over yourselves. I hated the debut when I first listened to it, but it is near the top of my favorite albums of the decade now. The difference? THE DEBUT WAS MUSIC! The irony (ironidence) here is not in the music itself, but that the album is a perfect reflection of the band - which is no band at all. When your lead singer broods in a corner all day and doesn't even speak to the rest of the band, it should come as no surprise that they record an album that sounds exactly like three year-olds on a play date - or an industrial band
0	I wanted to listen to music -- now I have to reinstall windows I'm tremendously dissapointed by this product. I can't express in words how angry I am at having to spend 6 hours repairing my computer after the cd installed a backdoor on to my that allow sony to access any file on my computer. Its infuriating how the goverment has allowed SONY/BMG to do this to us. If a person has hacked millions of computers and installed software that allowed access to the entire harddrive, that person would be in prison. Sony /bmg did this to us and they get away with a slap on the wrist. Despite the harm that this CD has done to me, I'm keeping it. It will be a symbol that I will use remind myself how our corrupt goverment is controlled by corporate interests -- and the harm that these corporations cause to increase their profits
1	A very good way to enjoy eighties metal. This was one of the best compilations that I have come across. It starts out powerful and ends a little slow but every song is good and it made memories come back
1	Hypnotic, Eerie, Playful and A Wonderful Musical Wild Ride This 1974 release by guitarist Ralph Towner only reaffirms his genius and versatility as a musician/composer. Teaming up with bassist Eberhard Weber, drummer Jon Christensen and saxophonist Jan Garbarek, Towner took 3 other very highly developed musical personalities on a wild ride with him through dark spooky forests ("Visitation"), vast seas ("Oceanus"), deserts ("Sand") and more. Towner lets forth some beautiful Bill Evans-esque piano musings on "Drifting Petals", and even engages Jan Garbarek in a lively duo on "Winter Solstice". Things even get funky on "Piscean Dance". Bassist Eberhard Weber adds not only brilliant electric upright bass lines to the proceedings but goes further to add eerie choruses of cellos and bowed bass. Jan Garbarek proves a more than capable foil for Towners full rich guitars and piano with his stark, icy, yet oddly soulful tones on tenor, soprano and flute. One of his best moments is "Nimbus" with its tumbling flutes and stern tenor sax interjections. "Visitation" gets my vote for spookiest track on an ECM release. This improv piece is VERY effective in conjuring up vivid images of walking through a spooky forest at night, screech owls in full cry and something lurking behind the twisted trees. All throughout, drummer Jon Christensen provides very flexible and empathetic playing, really listening to what's going on and giving his all without overpowering the other musicians. He shoud definitely get a MVP Award in the ECM stable (as he's appeared on so many ECM discs). Prepare ye for a mindblowing listening experience!
1	The best CD I am typically not a fan of "Live CDs", but I have to say that this is absolutekly the best Live CD I have ever heard. It makes you feel you are in the Club with him. Todd Snider's music is some of the best for such a youngster. This is obviously not a highly produced/made over cd so the recording quality of some songs is different, but as I said you are in the club with him! There are a couple songs that I would have liked to have on there, but that leaves something for the next one. I have listened to it many, many times and I still laugh at his stories. I have let a variety of others (a wide range of ages and interests) and every one has enjoyed it. I recommend this Cd with out one bit of reservation. The recording issues only adds to the enjoyment of feeling like you are there. Shouldn't that be the goal of a Live CD?
0	To sum up... Glenn Frey is to Don Henley what motorbikes are to fish
1	So nice to make love to.... I first heard a "Somethin' Bout Love" on the radio and had to have it. Then I heard the entire CD and it blew me away with its smooth, sexy feel. This CD is THE one to play next time you are spending an intimate evening with the one you love....thank you Brian for giving us this sensual set
1	Extreme Delight Wow! As a new admirer of Michael's, (within the last 7 years or so) I must admit that I've been missing out on a lot. Abandon Garden just happens to be my favorite album of his, as well as one of my &quot; All Time 10 Best Albums&quot;. I remember hearing some of his works when I was younger and thinking he was the voice behind &quot;Kermit the Frog&quot;. I had a chance to see him in concert once (Capital Jazz Fest, Coulmbia, MD July'98) and was absolutely enthralled. I have the complete collection of his works and I often play it for friends and co-workers. Easily, Abandoned Garden is the favorite amongst them. Even my non-Jazz enthusiast friends seem to love the album. My favorite song is &quot;A Fools Errand&quot;. Now haven't we all played that role before
1	He's still got it!! I have left comments on Tom's other cds and I am still always surprised and pleased with everything he turns out!! This cd is wonderful. Tom's voice sounds deep and powerful as usual and Jool's piano playing is astounding!!! The songs are wonderful and keep you on your toes. It has a great vibe and a different sound then anything else out there!! Hope you will fall in love with this cd just as much as I did!:
1	Pretty good exercise music I bought this album together with "Breathe" on the recommendation of my wife because I have been listening to the Dixie Chicks daily while I work out. I had never heard Faith Hill's music before but the suggestion was that if I like the Chicks' music I would like Faith Hill. Of the two albums, I much prefer this one. The opening number "Free" sounds like a Madonna tune (in fact, specifically I think it is really the same song as "La Isla Bonita" although I prefer this rendition). This CD is not as good as any of the Chicks' releases in the past 6 years but it's still worth buying if you are looking for some variety at the gym
1	Thanks Harry Bosch Everything Michael Connelly wrote about this album, played in Bosch's cliffside home, is true. Beautiful music
0	koopsta can do alot better Koopsta knicca is one of my favorite rappers but this album just didnt do it. He's sounds alot softer now and his first album the devils playground was 3x as good
1	Hmmm just imagine.... If this was released by the generic nu-metal bands in 2002, this album would be their best album. Yea, my point is that In Flames didn't sell out in RTR. They still have solos in most of their songs (although less than their previous works) and amazing riffs (not as many dual ones as Jesper and Bjorn were able to produce before). And also Anders voice hasn't changed quite yet and still is as good as Colony and Clayman, with the addition of singing. Even though it is a step down, it is still sounds like In Flames. And speaking of a sell out album, I would reccomend Soundtrack to your Escape because that is a sell out! Songs I'd reccomend from this album: Reroute to Remain Drifter Trigger Transparent Dismiss the Cynic
0	Lights Back On I loved Lights Out 1 and 2, but 3 was a huge disappointment, even after a few listens. Disc 1 begins with a robotechno caucophony that's just straight up weird, painful to listen to, and runs far too long. The rest of Disc 1 gets better, but it still left me waiting for some climactic crescendos or wild mixing twists. CD2 begins with an equally banal sound, and doesn't get interesting until about halfway through. (In fact, the last half of CD2 is the only part of this set that I ever listen to at all anymore.) Overall, the song choice is pretty blah, and even the mixing seems a bit sloppy and uninspired. It's definitely got Lawler's dark and nasty fingerprints throughout, but it sounds a bit canned, and definitely doesn't meet the standard set by 1 and 2
1	Only The Best By The Best I don't really Love this cd but one song on there really called out to me and it was "When Somebody loves You" I Love that song.
0	treeeeenndy punk is dead, enough said. all trhey do is play 3 power chords in a repeeated pattern and whine about politics this is what punk is then? huh something soooo trendy its dead beyond reason. to be punk iso to not even be notified, dress as a punk its just to change. its a rebellious/defensive attitude. not a mohawk or spike or whatever dude this band/music genre is really lame.let it g
0	The first feeble bleatings of a jazz &quot;purist&quot; I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it.
0	Not One of LIVE's Best. I love this band. They have an amazing amount of talent. However, this album has fallen short of their greatness. The first song is remenisent of "The Distance to Here", but you'll find out very quickly that this album lacks LIVE's creative song writing ability, and falls short of portraying their amazing talant. If you're a hardcore fan, I would buy the album, but don't expect greatness because it just isn't there
1	The ultimate! This is the BEST Jerry Lee Lewis album....Period. If you like his rockin stuff, you WILL love this album
1	Beautiful, heavenly, blissful music Ten stars !! Everyone who has a baby should have this music ! It is especially wonderful for babies with health problems. My son was an absolutely miserable baby due to undiagnosed reflux. 24/7, if he wasn't nursing, he was screaming. I first played this music for him when he was six weeks old. He immediately stopped screaming and the most blissful, peaceful look came over his face as he listened to the heartbeat sound he remembered from his time before birth. When I was pregnant, I had always worried that he was lonely in there, but now I know that unborn children still have one foot in heaven, because I could see that peace and bliss on his face as he remembered. It was wonderful to finally have a way to soothe him and I was so thankful for the music. I used the music very often. When he had to have surgery at 4 months of age, we took this music to the hospital and after his operation we played it in his room all night long to keep him settled down. The nurse taking care of him normally worked in the NICU, and he said they played this same music for the very sick and premature babies and the in the NICU because it helps to keep them calm and happy.
1	Cru, Seu Jorge The music on this album is simple bueaty. The sound of the guitar and his voice give a layed back feel
1	The Garden An interesting refreshingly new cd that is not in the mainstream of current popular music scene. Relaxing but exciting, pleasant melodies with great musical textures. I strongly recommend to anyone who has an enjoyment of fine music
1	If I were on a Desert Isle I have listened to the Don Shirley Trio since the 70's. My favorite song of all time is &quot;Water Boy&quot;. If I were shipwrecked on a desert isle and I could only have one recording this is the one. This man knows how to make music for the soul. The Trio's interpretation of tunes that are familiar brings a whole new meaning to the songs. Each time I listen I want to get up and move to the music
1	Excellent Mediternean Music which is alien to Westerners The classical music performed in the Ottoman Empire. May be it is not the actually the same music perfomed during 17th - 19th centuries, but it originates from there. An Excellent recording
1	Amazing young singer, hard to believe someone so young can sing like this! I had to respond to a comment made previously; "Another standout moment is her duet with Peter Cincotti on Neil Sedaka's "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do." Cincotti is clearly the superior singer here; he does piano here as well." Cincotti does have a very nice voice, and when he begins the song one is immediately impresses with his voice. Unfortunately, Renee then chimes in and like a cat dancing with a pig, she trounces his vocals. He simply is out classed by this little girl! Like Sinatra, Cincotti has a nice voice, but he seems even more limited than Sinatra in his range. Sinatra was a fantastic singer, but he know what he could or could not sing, and Concotti is likewise challenged. In contrast, Renee seems capable to singing anything ever written with the style of the greats such as Ella, and Lena Horn while also having the strength of voice of say Ronstadt, and Streisand. She may not be quite Opra ready yet, but I did say MAY not, as she darn well may be ready. At this age PERHAPS Charlotte Church had a stronger voice, but she certainly lacked the nuance which is needed for Jazz, and which young Renee has in abundance. I good friend of mine who worked closely with bands like Huey Lewis and the News, Earl Scruggs, etc. quickly picked up on her youth when he heard her sing, most would not I suppose, but he was stunned at her ability. The CD is not perfect, there are flaws, but as a package it is one heck of a musical ride this little girl takes you on! Last year I was hearing stories about her next CD out of Hollywood, but so far nothing. I just hope she stays with Jazz as I think it is the only formate where she can really demonstrate the full extent of her enormous vocal talent. I am very anxiously awaiting her next CD
1	their best album ever flawless Every album by a.a. has been good verus the world was great and fate of norns was almost flawless with oden on my side is such a great album from vallhalla awaits me to prediction of warfare.Being a member of the astru faith this cd has become like a musical bible for me i listen to this cd alot and bar none no other metal band could touch this album this year.Their were many good albums from slayer, celtic frost,hammerfall, cannibal corpse, deicide,sepultura but none of them could touch this cd.My personal faves were cry of the black birds,runes to my memory, and god's of war arise, this cd gets my vote for album of the year but could be in the running for metal album of the decade.
0	love the music, dislike the dual disc I really enjoyed the music, once I resigned myself to playing it on my DVD player when the CD would not play for me. I was disappointed the CD would not play. If I had known there would be a problem, I would have just ordered the regular CD. Jane Monheit has some classic Christmas tunes, as well as some lesser-known ones, such as "The Man With the Bag" which I thoroughly enjoy. I don't find the melisma as bothersome as some other reviewers do. It doesn't seem distracting and allows her to make the songs her own. Just for fun, I checked out the "live" performances and was unimpressed. With so many music videos that have high production value, her videos feel gimmicky at best and simply cannot compete. In addition, her lip-syncing seems amateurish. I cannot recommend this feature at all, thus my two star rating on this item. My advice: by the regular CD. I plan to send this dual disc back, if Amazon will accept it, and get the regular CD. That way I can listen to it in my car and have the ability to put in on shuffle with some of my other favorite holiday tunes, which is why I bought it in the first place. I'm sure her CD will become one of my family's holiday staples
0	DualDisc won't play I love Jane, but I'm going to have to return this CD because the DualDisc will not play in either my car or on my computer. Worthless to me, I have no idea if the music's good or not, since I can't get it to play
0	battle of the christmas jazz divas... Ho ho ho, what do you know... the two "it girls" of vocal jazz both released holiday CDs this year within days of each other... first it was Jane Monheit with the ambiguously titled "The Season"... then came Diana Krall's aptly named "Christmas Songs." So who emerges victorious in this battle of the Christmas jazz divas? The first thing to consider, of course: who has the most gratuitous glamour shot on the album cover? Diana's suggestive and/or very uncomfortable pose in some kind of lawn chair wearing a billowy shiny green dress (strategically revealing as much leg as possible) is a real contender... but Jane's heavily airbrushed/photoshopped snow bunny/nymphette get-up (complete with floating bubbles for no apparent reason) is the clear winner in this category. On to the tunes... I have to look closely at Jane's disc before putting it in the CD player... it's one of them newfangled "DualDisc" deals with a CD on one side and DVD on the other -- you can only tell the difference by looking closely at the tiny little print around the hole in the middle... once you've figured that out, you know you're in for a rocky ride when the soft-rock contempo-easy backbeat of "This Christmas" kicks in... you gotta give Ms. Monheit credit for trying to come up with some fresh material here, but this is some really cringe-inducing stuff... things don't get much better with "Merry Christmas Darling," a comatose, melody-free bit of nothing featuring a tinkly electric piano solo and overdubbed backing vocals. Things pick up on the more jazzy swingin' tracks such as "Man with the Bag" and "Sleighride"... however on ballads like "Moonlight in Vermont" and "Have Yourself a Merry Litte Christmas," Jane reveals a disturbing tendency toward Mariah-esque melisma that will make your skin crawl. The guitar/vocal rendition of "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day" is nice, but next thing you know you're awash in the treacly jazz/pop crossover of "My Grown Up Christmas List" and heading straight for the eggnog... I do give Jane a lot of credit, though, for including the somewhat neglected holiday classic "The Christmas Waltz" (one that Diana apparently overlooked or just doesn't like...) What about the DVD side of this "revolutionary DualDisc,"? Wow, folks... it's amateur hour at Epic Records... a faceless actor in the shadows pretending to be a radio host interviews Jane (looking refreshingly like a normal person) about a few of the songs on the album, interspersed with badly lip-synched "videos" of those songs which consist entirely of soft-focus waist-to-head shots of Ms. Monheit uncomfortably hamming it up for the camera.. yikes... oh, and you can also listen to the entire album in "enhanced stereo" (whatever that is)... the best plan is to simply skip the flip side... better yet, save yourself a few bucks and get the normal CD version if you intend to buy this album despite its weaknesses (when it's available again, that is: the original discs were recalled as part of the Sony copy protection "rootkit" debacle...) Decision: Diana Krall over Jane Monheit by a (gentle) knockout...(see my Amazon review of "Christmas Songs" for details...
1	It's good to be da King! For a "Best of" this album has a fantastic track list. The sound quality is that great vintage "Pulp Fiction" surf rock sound that we have all grown to appreciate. It's a BUY even if you have just the smallest of urges to listen to what this stuff is all about. Dick Dale is the godfather of this sound, that has become the staple of this form of rock
0	Gershwin's playing overated After I heard this cd I bought Gershwin plays Gershwin on the naxos label which arn't piano rolls. Any pianist can tell that many of these rolls are heavily edited and can't be played by a pianists with two hands. On the naxos album that has some of these same songs Gershwin's actual playing doesn't sound very good. Many of Gershwins contempories such as James P. Johnson, Eubie Blake, Luckey Roberts and even Zez Confrey were much better pianists than he was, however they didn't have his melodic gifts as a composer. I would recommend Artis Whodhouse's transcriptions of Jelly Roll Morton's piano rolls (on the same label) instead because most of those are exactly how he played them and in my opinion Morton was a better musician in every way than Gershwin.
1	Very Pleasing Musically The only problem that I have with &quot;Specialist in All Styles&quot; is due to my own ignorance. That is, I don't speak any other languages. Therefore, the lyrics could be mocking me for purchasing the album, and I would know any better. But I don't think that they are mocking me. I say that because the music contained throughout the album is just great. These ensemble from Senegal is a group of clearly talented musicians. The Latin-Themed music combined with African beats is a pleasing combo that I find very easy to listen to. Again since none of the music is in English none of tracks in particular stand out to me, but don't let that stop you from picking this little gem out. It is an instant classic for any beginners World Music collection, and will provide instant street cred for all aspiring music buffs
1	Brilliant First Album Poerful, melodic pop songs. With a cover of an Arthur Lee/Love song. Buy a copy now
0	Disappointment I found that I was not disappointed by any of Herrmann's works, until this one. The first track is good, but much of the others do not sound like the Herrmann I know
0	The ONLY good thing about this single... I feel skeptical about NIN singles ever since they have stopped releasing them domestically in the USA. The singles just haven't been as good. The ONLY good thing about this single is the Live At Rehearsals version of Love Is Not Enough. It has a raw and rough feeling that I appreciate from the NOW too over-produced NIN. The DFA remix of THTF is too long - drawn out and redundant... like a bad techno song. Buy this if you collect Halos (like I do)... but if you're looking for a great single with great remixes... look for the promo 12inches instead.
1	The Title Track Alone Merits 5 stars Milestones is a transitional recording . Sandwiched betweeen Round ABout Midnight and Kind Of Blue, it features Miles with Coltrane and Cannonball just before Miles' move to a pure modal approach on Kind Of Blue. For me the title tune is a stunner and it has become something of a jazz anthem for good reason. The contrast between Adderly's melodic playing, Coltrane's harsher approach and the perfectly understated trumpet of Miles Davis is one of those moments in musical history that make you shake your head in wonder. The treatment given Monk's Straight No Chaser is fantastic. This is right up there as one of my favorite Miles recordings
1	Looking Glass I never had or heard this particular album before but if you like Looking Glass try to find a cd (or album) called &quot;Subway Serenade&quot;. It has &quot;Jimmy Loves Marry-Anne&quot; on it but all of the songs are awesome ( I like them anyway )
0	If you love the Raiders "do the right thing-buy Sundazed" I originally purchased the set upon it's original release in 1990, over the years I have listened to it may times, continuing to comparing it to many other remastered tracks and cds of its time...always concluding that the tracks (especially disc 1, disc 2 kicks in with "him or me") sounded like they came directly from vinyl,I have today just received the Sundazed Midnight Ride. Let me tell you if you love this stuff as I do, and want to hear the Raiders, pass on this collection, and get the Sundazed, the sound blows "Legend" out the door! I can't wait to get the rest on Sun.
0	SUPERB COLLECTION - UNBEARABLE SOUND QUALITY Much has been made here about the Remixes on this collection. The truth is that the audio problems go FAR beyond the remixed titles. The whole of the 2nd disc is a washed out, muddy audio mess and it is inconceivable that someone at Sony/Columbia didn't catch it before release. This compilation is about 15 years overdue for a serious remaster. Some of the titles here can be heard in far better quality on the Sundazed releases, however admittedly a few of those have some excessive overmodulation issues. They are still by far the lesser of two evils. At least the songs PUNCH the way the Raiders need to punch. As is, the "Legend" CD sits on my shelf gathering many years worth of dust. It's far to painful to listen to
0	Danger Danger - self-titled (Sony) First CD of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out.Cannot believe they lasted that long.I remember seeing these guys open for Alice Cooper on his 'Trash' tour.Talk about your suck-support acts.Simply love some of the song titles here,like their Mtv video "Naughty Naughty" and "Bang Bang".Like,how long did it take for them to think those up?Other hair bands I don't care for include Trixter,Warrant(after CD no.2)and Firehouse.Total waste of time,money and effort.I've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of White Lion,Faster Pussycat or Poison.Don't you dare!Danger Danger doesn't EVEN come close.Avoid at all costs
1	No Excuses....Add To Cart ASAP!!! If you've made it this far and are a Dictators fan, shame on you for even needing a review to convince you to buy this! Are you hesitating because of the price? How much have you spent on Dictators albums in the last 25 years? Maybe you're hesitating because you're concerned about terrible sound or a lousy performance. Well, the sound is suberb (a great production job by Shernoff) and the performance flat out rocks. (I'd like to add.....this is not iPod music. This is 200 watts a channel and at least 10" woofers to move some serious air music). The major bonus here is the killer versions of the "Go Girl Crazy" songs. Even the remastered version of the studio album leaves much to be diesired. The songs on this live album finally do those 25 year old tracks justice. Satisfied? So add it to cart now or go to zShops and save a few cents. If you've made it this far on curiosity & your music collection is lacking in the Dictator's department, this album is the album to get. "Viva!" is a great representation of what this band is all about. After one listen you'll be adding all the studio releases to your collection fairly quickly. I only have a few minor "issues" to bring up. So, if you are not a fan of the band already, just skip my ranting below, buy the cd and come back to read this later. Ok? The below may be considered blasphemy and I may burn for it. But I need to get them off. The only beef I have about the sound is the imbalance in the guitar mix. Ross's guitar in the right channel is set on about "10" while Top Ten's guitar in the left channel is set on about "7"; and this is a very picky, long time fans criticism. Second, this is not a true live album per se rather than a collection of live songs. Songs put together with very little between song chatter and audience participation. Some songs actually fade out to silence. All this gives the album more of a "live in the studio" than audience live recording feel. The last song "Cars & Girls" was recorded at an audience free sound check and sounds no different than the rest of the album. I was really hoping to hear a few between song sermons from Manitoba and it was not to be. Lastly, no music from "Manifest Destiny". This may be a contractual issue however and not an oversight by the band. But the one thing that overshadow's all my nitpicking is Ross The Boss. If you have all the albums on vinyl, then you know where I'm coming from. Ross's playing here blends the ferocity of the Stooges James Williamson with the melodic playing of "Buck Dharma" with a little bit of Ace Frehley thrown in. He's never, never, never, never, never sounded better. That's it....
1	I have loved this album since 2002... ...when I discovered it in Hawaii. Whenever I listen to it, I remember the peace I found there, and I used several of the songs at my wedding. In fact, the main song "Shores of Avalon" became the basis of the theme to my wedding last year. I also used one of the songs "Full Moonlight Dance" to create a dance ensemble piece with Persian, Middle Eastern and ballet influences, which was performed at a concert in Burbank, CA in 2003. I tried to write to Tina Malia to tell her how much I love the album, and also think the musicianship is fantastic, but couldn't get a message through. Perhaps she is a true gypsy. Anyway, I come into contact with lots of different world music, and this album consistently rates as one of my top favorites
1	"Color TV" finally At First this was kind of disappointing after hearing epics like "English Settlement" and "Apple Venus" and "Skylarking", but this is actually quite good, sometimes even on par with the three wonders stated before. The CD clocks in at over an hour with the several bonus tracks from singles released from this album and two really different songs from a series of experiments Andy did, these are "Frost Cirus" and "Procession Towards Learning Land". These songs sound pretty cool, but aren't the better part of the album. The B-sides are pretty amazing with the three catchy songs that could have been A-sides "Jump", "Toys", and "Gold". "Desert Island" is also an excellent song about Britain...."Don't Rescue me...No! No! no-ohhoh"! The actual original Mummer tracks shine as well AFTER A COUPLE LISTENS, the singles "Love on a Farmboy's Wages", "Great Fire", and maybe even "Me and the Wind"(it is too far out in the album though, you may want to quit listening before then) will hook you on first listen. "Love on a Farmboy's Wages" was definitely the first friendly song in the batch on first listen with its catchiness and wit. "Great Fire" has a great drama to it that anyone will like, it is a wonderful tune. Colin's single "Wonderland" has really cheesy production, so I had to skip it(it was so strange). But it is actually a good song and is more than listenable after a few listens to Mummer. The opening tune "Beating of Hearts" is a powerful song that is almost romantic and shows the power of humans that separates us from the animals....emotions and "Love"! It is no wonder Terry wanted to leave XTC during this album, it is a dfferent direction for XTC...just about a 180 turn. That doesn't mean this is a bad album...by all means it was XTC maturing. The only song that is really similar to old XTC is the "Funk Pop a Roll" song, which is pretty awesome and funny. Again it is slower and the songs completely different like Colin's "Deliver Us From the Elements" is filled with backing vocals that sound like they are from a church choir. Andy's "Human Alchemy" is profound and sounds Afircan or something and is really controvesial...read other reviews here...it s a really good song with a message. On first listen though production-wise it may be too much to stomach, but it is one of my favorites on here now. "Lady Bird" starts off with Andy scat singing and turns out to be a most excellent pop tune. A grand album with some questionable production, but that is the fun of the 80s. Recommended for XTC fans, unless you don't like quiet stuff.
1	These Guys Could Sing For Real I knew I had to buy this CD. I was 20 when Force MDs came on the scene in '84, and their music was the soundtrack of my young adulthood. Listening to their beautiful voices remind me how much I detest post 1990 music. This CD is a must for anyone who wants to hear what great harmonies sounded like back in the '80s
1	Sizzla Kalonji I am a bonified Sizzla Fan and I love this album because he dared to do something different. It shows his versatility as an artist and shows all that bobo asante's have big beautiful hearts. I m in Love with "show me" and "Love you more" my son loves " be strong" and " nothing bothers me". This is a feel good album and I just hope Sizzla stays unchanged since signing with Dame Dash music group
0	I had to buy it to believe it.... ...but it's true. Sammy's gone country. There are 2 MAYBE 3 tracks on this whole album that are any good. My taste in music is very broad with one exception - country. If I had to name one rock icon of mine, it would be Sammy and...Sammy...you really let me down with this album. It pains me to say so, but I can't recommend this album to the classic Hagar rock fan
1	A National Treasure It is not an overstatement to write that "Gershwin Plays Gershwin: The Piano Rolls" contains some of the most beautiful music ever recorded. Gershwin's virtuosity as a pianist is spellbinding. While his compositional abilities are well appreciated, who knew he was so good on the keys? The listener will be swept away by this recording's sweet melodies, tender craftsmanship and sensational speed. One might expect Gershwin's songs to sound thin and bare without an orchestra, but given the man on the piano, they sound surprisingly rich and full. Not a stripped down version of the real thing, Gershwin on solo piano is a means to an end, a different way to appreciate his music. Indeed, while Gershwin's orchestral music may sound a bit dated, his solo piano work has a timeless quality. Inexplicably, George Gershwin's solo piano music has languished under the radar. While this may be true for most listeners, there's nothing keeping you from enjoying "Gershwin Plays Gershwin.
1	Strange MAN You need something like this to eaither get the pary jumpn or even have a good day. I'll tell you once you hit play you'll get a smile oun your face. Scatterman and Snug are ingenious. Matter of fact words can't even describe, so go ahead buy 4 because everyone you know is gonna want one
1	For purists only If you bought this CD based upon Alison and John Waite's "Missing You" you are not going to find any other songs close to that on this CD. This is a CD of pure bluegrass and West Virginia folk/melancholy and spiritual songs, beautiful and haunting as they are, particularly with Alison's voice. There are 2 or 3 guest artists here and they harmonize well with Alison, but the bottom line is this is another CD of perfectly pure Alison (she produced this CD) music that meets her standards and they are high.
0	She's lost her way (temporarily, I hope) I had such high hopes for this album before it was showed up. Her previous releases with Union Station were artistic wonders - brilliant musicianship and thoughtful lyrics that required repeated listening to fully understand the complex relationships and stories that were presented. I couldn't wait to hear what they had been cooking up. Unfortunately, they didn't do any cooking on this album and I sincerely hope this is an aberration. I WANT to assume that someone simply gave her some bad advice or pushed her (I like to think kicking and screaming) to release some pabulum and make a quick buck. Until I hear differently, I'll continue to hold out hope that she's in the recording studio with Union Station working on another wonderful album. The song writing here doesn't hold a candle to "New Favorite" and "Lonely Runs Both Ways" and the performances themselves are pleasant enough (upon repeated listening, about four of the songs on "Miles" are keepers) but they are not the excellent work that I have associated with her in the past. Alison has the capability to sing the most beautiful, clear tone and only occasionally (to good effect) let a breathy tone in. "Hundred Miles" reverses this trend as she over-uses a breathy tone and in doing so lowers herself into the sea of mediocre, but pleasant singers that she previously soared above. Her song choices (please tell me that someone ELSE chose this mess of tunes for this album) are an embarrassment. Boring tunes, with silly or depressing themes (the body count on this album is very high - by the end, multiple children and adults have committed suicide, been killed, or otherwise died) and on many of the songs, I found myself glancing down at the time elapsed on my car's CD player as the music droned on and on (well into 5 minutes on too many). The best song? "Down to the River to Pray" - recorded years ago before the bad influences who produced this sorry lot got to her. The worst? Probably "Missing You" which is such a shock to the ears when the drums and electric guitar start pounding at the beginning of the track that I had to check the player to make sure I hadn't accidently hit a button somewhere and jumped to a top 40 radio station. What on earth prompted her to record (and then release) such a sell-out? Alison - the lure of popularity is NOT worth it. Please stay true to your artistic roots and never again make this deal with the devil. P.S. What are people thinking to make a song like "Whiskey Lullaby" such a big hit? I agree that the singing is wonderful and I love both of their voices and the tune itself. But it's all wiped out by the stupid lyrics. Why don't these two people pick up the phone and call each other? What version of what religion has angels singing whiskey lullabies? Who writes the words "put the bottle to her head and pulled the trigger?" I am drawn in when she sings (in previous albums) "let me touch you for a while" or "when you cross over there's no turning back once that burning bridge is gone." THAT's poetry. This is sad, silly junk.
1	Best 80's Metal Compilation Ever! This is the best 80's metal compilation ever! I remember when I was in 1st grade, and I played this CD over and over! There is not one bad song on this CD! I still have it, and it's all scratched up! I think I need to buy another copy
1	Ciao, downtempo lounge grooves if you are a part of the wallpaper*, surface*, &amp; Sapphire martini crowd, this cd is worth adding to your collection. Also, check out: Coming Home - Warming Up Your Living Area, from Stereo Delux
1	AT LONG LAST I have been waiting for years, nay decades for this long-lost album to be released on CD. This, the first of Karen Dalton's only two albums is, in my opion, the better of the two. Karen Dalton has a voice that demands to be heard for one of the most exotic aural experiences we have in the archives of pop music today. While I have been able to convince a few people that this is Lady Day singing, the arrangements just won't wash for such a deception the be successful for very long. This is a voice that sounds a lot like Billy Holiday, especially in her latter days, and the choice of material on this album and Dalton's rendition of it are an experience only the lucky few have had the pleasure of hearing. I doubt she ever will be well known enough to gain broad popular appeal, especially at this late date, but at least we don't have to search for the LP of this on Ebay anymore. This album is a musical treasure. If you have never heard of Karen Dalton before, buy this and find out what you have missed. If you have heard of her, you don't need any advice from me
0	really sucks If you really liked JUST WONT BURN then this could be a major disappointment like it was for me. Susan leaves the Blues for a smoother sound and leave's the fire and passion behind. Now there's nothing special about her. Susan please go back to the Blues
1	wonderful This piece is haunting and beautiful. The collaberation of the Chieftains and multiple female artists from around the world is so pleasing and mesmerising, I felt transported to another place and time.
0	sucks this cd sucks so much. it's the worst casualties cd ever. it has two good songs and the rest are completely horrible and they all sound the same. and i'm not just saying that because they're becoming more known/sell-out and stuff. this is seriously one of the worst cd's i own and i bought it the day it came out because i am a big casualties fan and they were talking about this cd being one of their most hardcore and creative works. the only good things about this cd are that there are pretty okay lyrics, and finally we hear some backup vocals from the other members of the band, which was only heard in a couple songs in on the frontline. they need a new singer or something. and i agree with everyone who gives this cd a poor revie
1	Best of the last This is the DEFINITIVE version of their last studio album. It contains more tracks and has a slightly different mix. None of the extra tracks are throwaway and some are arguably better than the songs on the original 'Driving to Damascus'. Is it their best album? I think it has more depth with the lyrics than anything Stuart Adamson has done, and he was always a great lyricist (these things being relative). If you don't yet have 'Driving to Damascus', buy this version instead. If you already have DTD, consider getting this one for the extra songs and the slightly different mix courtesy of Tony Butler, the band's bassist. It all works for me. Great melodic guitar rock, some of it very hard-driving while some of it very soft. Great, great lyrics. These are truly Stuart's last artistic statement
1	Great voice I think it's awesome that you don't have to win first place on idol to get a deal. Bo is really worthy of this. He sounds fantastic
1	Bo Bice is awesome !!!! Me and my wife watched American Idol and to be truthful we thought especially my wife that Bo should have won. My wife really loves his music and I got her the CD and now the single. I hope they let him rock the way he did on Idol because the man has major talent!!!
1	Bo Bice rocks! He may not have won the title of American Idol, but this country boy can ROCK! Vehicle is fantastic and in my opinion (even though I voted for Miss Underwood to win the competition) - Bo sings 'Inside Your Heaven' a thousand times better than Carrie. The price of this single is so minimal compared to the enjoyment true Bo fans will get out of it. Don't pass it up
1	LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY IS IT THAT DESERVING ARTISTIC PEOPLE ARE SELDOM BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT? THIS GUY IS AWESOME! CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HIM! FRENCH CAFE IS MY FAVORITE! BOUGHT CARENCRO FIRST AND WAS SWEEP AWAY. MARC, STAY TRUE TO YOUR MUSIC AND BIGGER/MAJOR DOORS WILL OPEN IN YOUR SEASON...YOUR DUE SEASON
1	Gorgeous Bill Evans is a musician you never tire of listening to. He has the ability to play a tune freshly, every time. This recording is, in my opinion, his finest. The first date after the untimely death of Scott LaFaro, this album is beautiful ,melodic and haunting. Every tune is played with typical Evans genius, but on this session he seems to be expressing his musical ideas with even more flavor and emotion. The first cut is the most expressive and emotive I have ever heard in the trio setting. I am sure it was dedicated to LaFaro, even though it supposedly is an anagram for the producer of the date, Orrin Keepnews. Evans expresses his passion, joy and grief for his young bassist in every note and the result is, to my mind, stunning. I love Chuck Israels' bass lines and the chords Evans plays quietly over the bass solo are beautiful and ephemeral. Every tune on this CD is wonderful, the playing of everyone is at such a high level of creativity that this music will live on forever. This is a can't miss choice if you like piano music
1	I'm so happy I bought this CD! I've been a fan of the Grateful Dead studio output for maybe about ten years. I've recently joined the real deadheads somewhat and have started to appreciate the live jams. I'm coming along on the jam side of the Dead, which I think is the side that most deadheads love, but I absolutely love the great stuff from the "studio dead." I guess the studio dead is Workingman's Dead and American Beauty. This album should be bought by fans of those two abums. I think this is from the same era, and Jerry Garcia really seems to be at some sort of creative high. It provides a window into the "jam dead" in easily digestible 3-6 minute songs on some of the tracks, and further proof that Jerry Garcia could write great concise songs as well. There are a few spacy instrumentals that lead up to "Eep hour" that aren't all that great, but, as stated in the liner notes, these can work as an intro to Eep hour. If you're on the fence about this one, there are 7 incredible songs on this album, buy it
1	Building a better guitar In the end of the 90s, some bands and guitar players decided to explore new grounds of music. Some of these attempts was successful, some were not. Good examples of artists that tried to sound modern was the German rock band Scorpions (EyeIIEye), Steve Vai (Sex & Religion), Jeff Beck (Who Else!, You Had it Coming, Jeff) and of course, Joe Satriani. In a particular boarding, Mr. Satch saw the rising experiments from genius guitar player and inspiration Jeff Beck and decided to make an attempt into a more electronic kind of music. Now, the difference between Beck and Satch is that Satch was creative, bold and concise in his boarding, and Jeff, well, lost himself in the path. Don't get me wrong, I love Jeff Beck from his Yardbirds/Tridents days to Beckology, he was truly a great genius, egomaniac, but genius, comparable only with Jimi Hendrix. But Jeff's techno sound is boring, noisy and truly out of place. He affirmed himself that his techno albums is among the worst ones ever produced by him. Joe Satriani, in a kind of inspired mood and brilliance knew very well how to create his chops without sacrifice the music. He created a balance between him, his human band and the Pro-tools. He sounds fantastic in this release. Challenging, groundbreaking, powerful, beautiful and pleasant. Rumor has that the title of the album was inspired in the molecular nanotechnology book "Engines of Creation", written by K. Eric Drexler in 1986. The book also have an interesting line that says that "what we can do depends on what we can built". I don't think that's a mere coincidence, considering the illustrations on the album's sleeves. Judging by that we can presume that we have a conceptual record in hands. Of course, as an experiemnt, somethings goes very nice and somethings nor in such a way. "Devil's Slide" is a good example of a very cool, dynamic and inspired piece. "Borg Sex" is like imagining robots having sexual relations, and the song has a very nice mood. "Champagne?" is some kind of tribute to Jeff Beck, it's very similar to the sound that Jeff has been developing in his comeback album "Who Else!", by far, his best effort with techno rock. There's also beautiful electronic moments like "Clouds Race Across the Sky", witch is a nice soundscape song, and also human moments, like the wonderful ballad "Until We Say Goodbye" and the awesome closing title track. But the breathtaking moment of the album is the two-track song "The Power Cosmic 2000", witch is a nice improvement compared with it's version released as a single. With this release, Joe got his foot into a modern and nice sound and continues to sound relevant. Of course, this is the "we don't need another one" kind of album. Joe knew it very well, since techno music sounds dated nowadays, and returned to his human sound in his next release. But as far as it went, it was a wonderful experiment and a very consistent work that still deliver us in a nice mood
0	The worst of the lot Joe misses the mark with this one. In fact, this album doesn't compare to his others even remotely. Maybe he thought he was doing what was popular, or maybe he just wanted something different, but, to me, this album sounds like video game audio. If you want some real Joe, buy Surfing With The Alien, Flying In A Blue Dream, The Extremist and/or Is There Love In Space
0	What in the world happened? When I first heard that 4 Strings would be coming out with another album I was excited. I had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that I had high hopes for this one. The first single was amazing! The day it came out I ran out and bought it. I must have listened to it hundreds of times, it was so good! I couldn't wait for the actual album. Then it came out...My excitement diminished. First of all, I realized that Vanessa was barely on the cd. You don't mess with a good thing! Vanessa's voice complimented the music so well! Then a second problem arose: the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album's music only this time with different lyrics. What happened?! The only relief I found in this cd was the track "Euphoric Eyes." It's the only track that doesn't make me want my money back. (even both versions of the title track "Turn It Around" make me angry. I advise getting the single, as it has the best version.) So here's my verdict: Major disappointment. Why, 4 Strings? Why
0	There's a reason why this was one of the greatest sellers of all time. For those of you who don't know, this ranks in the top 100 as one of the greatest selling albums of all time. Right up there with Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon! There's a reason for this. First let's all learn a new word today: commercialism Webster's dictionary states that commercialism is the practice of exchanging or selling products between different individuals where each individual is trying to gain something they didn't have before at the expense of losing something they already had. This does work one ways sometimes. For example: In Britany Spears' case record consumers lose their money to Spears and Spears doesn't give anything back in exchange. Or maybe she does? She gives us images of her body which make inperfect looking girls feel like garbage. She gives us paper from the linear notes which we could use to jot down notes on or use as napkins. She gives us talentless images and sounds which make us thankful we have talents and vaules which she clearly lacks. So why is this such a great selling album. Because people are willing to buy the album and, as a result, get those great things I mentioned in the previous paragraph. And there is a reason why those things are great. Where would we be today without Spears' casual sex preferences encouraging young girls to have all the sex they want and thus come down with AIDS and God knows what else. Where would we be without Spears' MTV videos encouraging us to sit around at home watching them while gaining weight from lack of exercise and eating doritos. All the while she stays fit because of her personal trainers and chefs that she got with our money. And where would we be with out an idol to kiss the feet of and sacrafice animals to. See, with out those great things we would be stuck in a world where people feel good about themselves, are highly motivated, and realise that you don't have to look perfect to be a good person. Thank God we live in this world where everbody is unequal and there is a sharp divide between the rich and beautiful and those who aren't. I don't think are favorite, lovable idol, Britney Spears', would be able to survive in the formerly mentioned world. ......if you believed anything in that second paragraph then this album is for you! As I said before I'm not forcing you to not buy this album, I am just giving reasons why I think its a poor product and is not recommended unless you really like commercialized bubblegum.
1	Truth Green Day is the largest band in the world right now, the only bad to make the punk rock opera that stormed the world over. people critisize them because they are jealous. They are better and more talented them "Mee-tall-ica" and rap "hustlers" "iz u with ma" (makes no sense) and they're angry cuz they're going strong 18 years now and they are capable of real music. hats to those who had good feedback for this incredible album Bad critics are jealous too. But of course they'll deny it like all cowards in this world
0	Disappointed - use original I must say I am rather disappointed... however I am not the "target market". The problem is it is basically the same as original, only played using keyboards and instead of voice you get another track of keyboard. All the songs are "lullabys" itself as written originally by Smith & co. Therefore my suggestion is get your CD burner and create your compilation for the baby from original CDs. It will do the same job and you will have more fun :) ..as the songs get slightly boring played with keyboard and without the lyrics ;) My son (slightly &lt;2yrs) already knows the original songs, of course -LOL-, and he does not seem to relate to this more than original. He likes MOBY most of all :D OK, that is my 2c. P P.S. The same is true for Radiohead and Nirvana that I bought as well. P.P.S. I bought many of these for my friends babies and (some) like it a lot.. so YMM
1	Mariah Carey is amazing Mariah Carey is one of the all-time best singers in music history. Her ability to hit typically unfathomable notes is, of course, her trademark and signature; but unlike some of her contemporaries, especially the late 90s and early 2000s pop stars like Britney Spears, her singing is the reason for her popularity, as it should be for any singer. Her #1's is a great CD, as are many compilation records by artists because they feature their big hits and not the filler from the actual studio releases. Impressively, Carey has had an incredible amount of singles but also an amazing number of No. 1's, more than any other female artist and rivaling only The Beatles and Elvis Presley. Even though #1's is not meant to be a Greatest Hits package (as Carey has said in the enclosed album art) like her official Greatest Hits CD released several years later, it certainly comes off as one. Mariah's voice remains powerful throughout the years as heard on #1's. Brilliant--certainly worth purchasing because it compiles the sound that made the 1990s
0	Not impressed Ick. I hated this CD. The first few songs were good, but the rest just sound like a motion picture soundtrack. What a waste of money
0	snooze fest I'm sad to say that Suede has hit rock bottom with "New Morning." There's just nothing here that moves me. No edge to the music or lyrics that I expect from this band that was so darn good in the early 90's and that desperately tried to carry the torch after Butler left. Brett Anderson's voice sounds pretty good. I just wish they had better songs to show it off. They had mixed success on Coming Up and Head Music but this just falls flat IMO. If you are planning to sample Suede for the first time after reading or hearing about them I would recommend the Bernard Butler era albums "Suede" and "Dog Man Star". The double album B-sides "Sci Fi Lullabie" is fantastic too and lets you taste great tracks full of promise even after Bernard Butler split
0	Ignore this! actually I meant to write this review for the subsequent album, which I found to be too bland to play more than once. This one I haven't listened to. Ooops
1	Some of the best Albert King stuff Agreed - this is some of the best songs I heard Albert play on record. Truly an excellent collection. You'll hear not only Albert's awesome soulful singing but also a LOT of intense blues guitar, which is truly "King". The sound quality leaves more to be desired, but it is acceptable. Material more than makes up for it. I played this record to someone who's never heard Albert King's material before and they were shocked. I'm a fan of Albert King, and this is a valuable disc in my collection
1	Awesome! My favorite cd in the world and the best Dolly cd ever. If you just like good older music and don't like dolly buy this anyway she does the best covers I have ever heard! I love it and would recomend it to anyone! BUY IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN
1	yup just had to give BT some props for a really good cd after bashing his new cd pretty bad. This is a classic in the eletronic music world and much better then any of BT's new stuff I've heard. mmfc
0	2 1/2 stars-- Post punk energy music. Punk, like all great rock music, was a rebellion, in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s. BUt somewhere along the way, it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against-- in the case of XTC, the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s. But these influences were far receeded on their debut album, "White Music" is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is, more than anything else, an album of energy music. The net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band-- songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding would come later to excel at lush, detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks, textures and harmonies, but here, it's all very stripped back, ska and punk influenced pop. Moulding's trademark slithering bass isn't quite in place yet, though he's already starting to find holes to fit himself in, he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer Terry Chambers. Partridge's guitar, for his part, limits largely to angular punk and ska trends-- loud and aggressive, pushing the music along from the front, which leads Barry Andrews' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band. But with all this, the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs-- Partridge and Moulding both use an unnatural, clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else, to the detrimant of the band's sound. With all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album, it still manages to hit pretty frequently, helped no doubt by the fact that Partridge's songwriting was already top notch. Standout "Statue of Liberty" best illustrates this-- hints of ska, gentle organ textures, and a funky bassline over which Partridge's clever story of unrequited love can be read out. Nearly as notable are punky opener "Radios in Motion" (full of crackling punk energy), the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single "This is Pop?" (featuring the closest Partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion, even if it is laden with great pop hooks), and new wave gem "Atom Age", with just enough of a hint of Brian Wilson to pull it above the rest. On the other hand, there's a lot of largely forgettable material-- Moulding's songwriting feels like it's not quite ready ("Set Myself on Fire") and his vocal is even more painfully forced than Partridge's ("Cross Wires"), and even Partridge has a couple duds ("Spinning Top"). Add to this an ill-conceived ska take on "All Along the Watchtower" that makes Partridge sound like a bad Hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package. The reissue adds quite a bit to the original-- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there's seven bonus tracks-- early singles and the "3D EP". Most of this stuff is largely forgettable (Moulding's "Heatwave", Partridge's "Dance Band" and "Traffic Light Rock"), but early single "Science Friction" and its b-side "She's So Square" are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen. XTC would find enormous heights in the following decade, and I can't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they'd eventually reach. I have a sneaking suspicion that had I not heard what they'd be capable of in the future, I'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating, but compared to their later work, "White Music" sounds positively amateurish. It's got its moments, but they'd go on to do a lot better
0	A Big Disappointment Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I thought this set was a big letdown. In addition to the points brought up by some of the other reviewers (missing tracks, songs out of sequence, etc.), I thought the sound quality was anything but excellent. I could see some of the recordings from the 30s sounding weak, but there is no excuse for those from the 40s and 50s sounding as poor as they do. I have a ton of 40s recordings and very few sound as bad as these do. Hell, I have 78s that sound better. It's a shame as I really like the Sons of the Pioneers, but for good quality cowboy recordings going to have to stick with Riders in the Sky until some one comes up with a better set than this
0	Not the best example of the genre. The Planets seem to have a problem deciding what they'l be. Are they a band that puts a rock twist on classical? Are they a bloated chamber orchestra? Are they a rather sparse symphony? What is on this album is a good example of mediocrity. If you want good poppy classical music, check out Vanessa Mae. If you want good classical music, look at the scores of albums arranged by truly great composers. The Planets try hard and fall flat. Perhaps in another couple of albums they'll have found their voice, but it certainly isn't on Classical Graffit
1	Great album This was one of those impromptu buys. Hadn't ever heard of her before, just liked the clips and said, "why not?" There isn't a single bad song on here, so how often does that happen? She's a screamer for sure, but it's still melodic and not too downtrodden. Her range of styles is impressive, too. Not too many screamers can do the ballads so well :-
1	yeah! Who said you need a lot of songs on a CD to have a good record??? This has already got 7 thrashy metal songs from one of metal's finest! If you are new to Slayer, I recommend getting all their early stuff first - or even just that
1	Perhaps their best? I was fortunate enough to be at the CD release concert for this album last night at the Birchmere in Alexandria, VA last night, EfO's home turf. They performed pretty much all the songs on the CD (only leaving out "No Pain, No Problem) with some of the older songs sprinkled throughout. And even after hearing all the songs, we still played the CD in the car on the way home. If you're a fan of EfO already, you probably own this CD already. If you're new to the band, either this CD or any of their two live CD's (Portable EfO Show and Three Rooms) would be a good place to start. Or, better yet, get all three. There is not one weak song on the entire CD. Standouts include "When the Rain Crashed Down," "Baltimore," the title track, "Walk Humbly, Son" and really, the rest of the album.
0	Great Songs - Poor Recording Quality Although the song titles are great, the music sounds very flat. these songs are all likely original recordings. If you want to hear the original sound and imagine your stereo systems as one of those old horn-type record players, you'll love this CD. Otherwise, find something else
0	He's just as bad as the people he patronizes I hate to condemn records I bought. Mainly because it's a confession that I've wasted my money on bad art. &quot;Sail Away&quot; is bad, and could have been worse except for a few good songs: &quot;Last night I had a dream&quot;, &quot;Simon Smith..&quot;, &quot;Political Science&quot;, &quot;Memo to my son&quot;, &amp; &quot;Dayton Ohio - 1903&quot;. The rest are as near to awful as you can get. Good lyricist? I don't think so. Besides his awful attacks on touchy subjects, his phrasing is always typical, and his rhyming hardly goes as far as rhyming &quot;me&quot; with &quot;be&quot;. I already had &quot;Good old boys&quot; (decent), and the songs on &quot;Sail Away&quot; were practically ripped right off of the former album. The music is almost always unlively (simple piano chords); hardly the riveting stuff I usually listen to. This is a big scar in my music collection
1	My daughter gives it a five!! A must have for any 7 - 14 year old! If they love High School Musical, they will love this
1	Clever and Cute JS has a very pretty if rather small voice. Her lyrics are smart and different. Songs are catchy. I'm surprised none of the tracks from Pink Pearl were hits. She's a good singer-songwriter who deserves more recognition. Check her out
1	Motifs by Paris Combo This group is very consistent. This CD is as good as their others. I can't wait to see them in concert in San Francisco in October
1	This is a really good CD!!!! I love this CD! Since I am reading the book and have watched several movies, this musical means a lot to me. When I finally relized who was singing this and who was singing that and why they were singing it etc, etc, I enjoyed it even more! At once, I put it on my ipod and listen to it constantly. Jean Valjean is my favourite singer on this cd. But then, of course, he is my favorite character of all times in the book. I espeicialy like the songs "Bring Him Home" and "What Have I Done?" The one song I don't care for is the final song. I know this sounds silly, but I cry almost every time I hear it. Eponine is my second favorite. Well, she ties with Enjrolas that is. If I were to be in this musical I would like to play her part. Her voice is strong but soft at the same time. Of all the songs she sings, I like "A Little Fall of Rain" the best. Enjrolas is really good too. This would bring me to more of my favorite songs. "Red and Black" and "Do You Hear The People Sing?" My final conclusion must be this: I love this CD. Please, if buy this CD, cherish it. It had GREATLY impacted my life. This CD is GREAT! You can see just what I'm talking about! Perhaps this feeling that this is the best musical only belongs to me. But then again.............
0	Switching Instruments Coleman's play on different instruments showed a lot of skill, but the music seemed to lose some of its spontaneity in the process. The jazz represented to me a kind of neo-be-bop that lacked lyrical luster and moving harmonies. jw
0	Rather tedious This music is excellent within the film. As a stand-alone work, it's boring. It sounds like video game background music. Some music works solely as incidental to the scenes in the film and this is the case with 300. Excellent film - uninspired soundtrack

1	Stick to R&B! Tyreese will always get 5 stars from me when it comes to singing. However, the last thing we need is another rapper out there rapping about the same thing. Tyreese has a sexy, sensual, and pleasant singing voice that's very pleasing to the ears, but with the rapping it just sounds like he's trying too hard to prove that he can rap. Then again, this review may be a little biased because I'm not used to that side of Tyreese. I just don't see him in that light, as a lyricist instead of a vocalist. I'm sorry, Tyreese will always be a singer/actor and not a rapper to me. I think that's why he made it a double disc set because he knew that everyone would just buy the R & B disc, but nobody would buy the rap disc
1	Excellent Work This release from Delerium is pretty much there most polished up & edited cd to date. It is good. Although I feel it is not there best, it is nice to hear the 2 members working together again. I give it 5 stars. Buy it
1	Why does it have to be one or the other? The concerns raised about Phair's last two album are hardly palatable. The general concensus seems to be that either: 1) She's a total sell-out, angry rock was her only voice 2) She's way better than she used to be, softer is good Why does it have to be one or the other? People say she's losing her tough edge, some say she's got a new bead on life. I don't see this as being one type of music or the other. I see a great songwriter and passionate person going with what makes her happy - not resentful music for the reality-impared outsider or love music for the overly-sappy contemporary, but well produced, thoughtful works of art that refect something different with each release. I'm not saying that this is "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" or anything, but it's also miles from Britney Spears. Phair's music has always been just that - Phair's music. So if it's not what you like, get over it. It's not about you. It never has been. If you don't believe me check out her ITunes Original Album. And play on Liz, play on
1	The Shepp To Get! As an earlier review states, Shepp tended to have some dead spots on his earlier releases. This on cooks from start to finish (which includes two great tracks from his &quot;Kwanza&quot; lp). The addition of piano makes this set his most accessable impulse cd. The piano reinforces the feeling of the blues which as always been present with Shepp, but here there is no denying it. HIghlights include &quot;Frnkenstein&quot; and &quot;Bakai.&quot
1	Get this First If you want to check out Beth, get this one first - she has since lost the edge ... and also a great guitarist in Jimmy!!
1	A FLAWLESS CD Patty Loveless's work in the 80s and 90s was exceptional (It is a shame that she shifted to bluegrass (Maybe because she can't get any airplay on country stations? Which favors stuff like Faith Hill, who can't even carry Patty's microphone.).As for this CD, it is exceptional, you cannot get much better on a single disk than this (Maybe Toby Keith's Greatest Hits 2?). Songs like "I Think About Elvis", "Lonely Too Long", "Blame It On Your Heart". "Here I Am", and "How Can I Help You Say Goodbye?" (A real heartwrenching song, and this is from an alpha male), are country classics. And the rest of the CD does not have a weak song either. Patty Loveless blows away just about any other female country singer since Patsy Cline with the exception of Sherrie Austin (Another singer who cannot get airplay). There is beauty, humor, sadness, and most of all INTELLIGENCE in her music. Patty is country for people who love intelligent, well thought out, and original lyrics. I would highly recommend getting this CD, then go out an get her "Greatest Hits" CD for material such as "Timber" and "Chains" (That CD also gets 5 stars, but is a little weaker). Simply put this is a flawless CD
1	Their best One fierce beer coaster is without a doubt the bloodhound gang's best album.Some of the best songs are "Why's everbody always pickin' on me?","It's tricky","Fire water burn" and "I wish I was queer so I could get chicks".This album is a classic that should be owned by any fan.Buy it now
1	intergallactic beats Mix master mike has really worked on his beats this time. i give him props for that. what i miss is like a scratch-theme in each track like dj revolution, dj premier are doing using acapellas and making own lyrics, sentences with it. Overall the album is ok, but not a classic.
0	What happened to Louie?! Listen... i dont know why they put the 5 star reviews up front (probaly to make him look good and cause they problay wrote reviews first) but if you ACTUALLY listen to this type of music, this cd really IS an insult. If you think Sandstorm is the greatest thing ever made, then YOUR an insult to us listeners. The First Dance cd i ever bought was infact a Louie Devito CD. NYC Underground 3. I LOVED IT! Me and my friends worshipped that CD and couldnt wait till NYC 4 cameout. But as time went on and we really got into dance music... we figured out that Devito just takes the top hits from ANY category and crams them onto a CD. I mean common!... Stacie Orrico!??! Then people who only hear these songs in clubs or on the radio think hes the king because hes got them on his CD. Do yourself a favor and DONT follow CD stores 1-10 top hits concerning Dance, techno, trance and so on. Oh yeah.. and dont buy the cd. its sad
1	I'm not gay but ........ I LOVE this CD set! Great selection of songs, guaranteed to get you on your feet and moving
1	Highly recommended This is definately one of the best live albums that I have heard. It rocks from beginning to end. This is the way that Blues Traveler need to be heard.....they are a terrific jam band and this double album shows them off to perfection. 2 new songs are also showcased here, &quot;Regarding Steven&quot; and &quot;Closing down the park&quot;. The booklet contains tons of photos and the lyrics to the two new songs. This album is a must for all Blues Traveler fans
0	1 star for Remastered - 5 stars for original Who remastered it? It sure wasn't Bob; find the UNremastered CD if you can. Or better yet, - the original LP is absolutely amazing. This remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is "New and Improved" when it is neither. For the best experience in appreciating Bob Marley and what he accomplished, read a biography, then listen to all the ORIGINAL albums. Here are some of my favorite Bob Marley songs that are NOT usually on any best list: Heathen, Small Axe, Who the Cap Fit, War, Get Up Stand Up, Johnny Was, Duppy Conqueror, Cry To Me, One Foundation. If I was forced to pick his best song it would probably be "War." Even though he didn't write the words and it is largely spoken, it is extremely powerful
1	Oud Great! By chance,I saw the trio perform at the Monterey World Music festival in 2002. The music starts out fairly slow, almost boring. After a few songs, the pulse of the one drum, the melody of the oud and clarinet really started to be hypnotic. At the end of the set the crowd gave the trio a standing ovation. I bought the CD and played it for a friend who thinks it is great 'massage' music. It is very soothing, relaxing, mysterious music that calms the mind
0	Stay clear unless you are REALLY SQUARE... yikes... way, waY WAY to slick and over produced... Its all just like muzak really. Stay clear unless you are REALLY SQUARE..
1	Totally Unsurpassed Film-Score Music! This dual CD set unambiguously deserves many more stars than just a puny five! I have heard none finer. And only a few CDs of equal quality. The legendary Miklos Rozsa is the film's composer. This is the inaugural release of Rozsa's complete score for the 1959 film BEN HUR (BH). The CDs contain 88 tracks in the same order as in the composer's original score. By "complete," I mean there is more music here than there was actually in the film. This is because the CDs include unedited cues and music from film outtakes plus one alternative track. The vast majority of tracks were recorded on the M-G-M sound stage with sizable orchestras of up to 75 performers. The result is sound of intense richness, but not to the point where ensembles over whelmed individual instruments (of which there were quite a few "unusual" ones). Not surprisingly, Rozsa won an Academy Award for BH (his third). While you can debate which of Rozsa's score is his best (my personal favorite is his music for the 1947 film THE RED HOUSE), there is no debate over the undisputed fact that ALL his 90 or so film composition are simply (or very close to) magnificent. The CD booklet is over-the-top outstanding, and easily the most extensive ever created. More of a book than a booklet, it's authors, Marilee Bradford (Ms. Bradford is also produced the CD set) and the late Tony Thomas, have provided us with a definitive source of reference. Rozsa was probably the only composer of his time who could create the score for BH. This CD set is probably the only recording of our time that demands to be in your collection.

1	mmmm this is john mclaughlin and mils davis at their finest. Before miles went fully into fusion, this "jazz-rock" is quite exquisite. SUPERB
1	Was sent as a present All I can say is that the product was sent on time with no hassle. The person I gave it to was quite pleased!
0	Tough going Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best
0	Rough in the Diamond Being an avid Neil Diamond fan I was anxious to get this CD. However; the songs are uninspired, unremarkable and banal. A huge disappointment
1	I Am If you don't have this CD, and you are thinking of buying it, think no more. This is another classic CD from EW&F
1	I don't get it ... why remaster a masterpiece? Nobody's reviewed the remastering yet. It's hard for me to imagine improving on the original CD. I'm an audio geek with mixing panel seat time mastering indy music and radio shows. I have a high-end audio system, on which Letter from Home in its original release needed no improvement, as far as I can hear. So why remaster Letter from Home? Can anybody help us understand how it's better????? Pat, if you're reading this, howzabout releasing a DVD from live shows during the Letter from Home time period? I have all your CDs and DVDs but while CDs fill up an entire shelf of my CD collection, all the DVDs fit in one hand...
0	Bah... There's really not much reason to buy this album. A year before this was released, Mannheim released an album called "Halloween," which was a two-disc set, with one disc featuring music (mostly Mannheim arrangements of "scary" classical pieces like "Hall Of The Mountain King," plus a few rehases of old Fresh Aire tunes), and the other disc featured spooky sound effects. "Monster Mix" takes samplings from that two-disc set and gives you the abridged version on one disc for a couple of dollars less. They also threw in "Full Moon", which was first released on their "Ambience Series" album, "Autumn Song." Incidentally, I like their "Autumn Song" album quite a bit better than either "Halloween" or "Monster Mix," but you can only get it directly through Mannheim's official website. For those who aren't familiar with the tracks on this disc-- some of the tracks are decent, though none reached the quality of music that Mannheim put out back in the late 80s/early 90s. Synthesizers always played a heavy role in Mannheim's music, but here, they get a bit overbearing and everything starts to sound a bit cheap and over-quantized (in other words, it all feels like it was machine generated-- which, I suppose, it was.) Still, if you like the Steamroller sound, and you want to hear them attempt a holiday other than Christmas, you may find this interesting for a couple of listens. But then, just pay the extra dollar or two and get the full double-disc set called "Halloween." Better yet, go to their website (mannheimsteamroller.com) and try "Autumn Song."
1	Magnificent! Bought this CD when I was in Australia and I fell in love with it from the first time i listend to it. A mix that will blow your mind, MoS has done it again - a record worth every cent. Get it, you wont be disappointed
1	the only current pop band i like! most music i listen to wouldn't sound anything like this. my idea of a good time is listening to mogwai at full volume or bumping hip hop with a lot of bass. of montreal are incredible. the bass lines are ridiculously funky. i didn't think i liked this cd as much as their other work, but after listening to it 10 times i can't get it out of my head. i usually prefer lyrics that aren't as literal as this, but it works really well. there's so many good songs 'but which one do i, do i cho-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose'. really, i don't know what the best song is, because all of the songs are either a 9-10. 'gronladic edit' is nothing short of brilliant. the transistion from tracks 2 and 3 is one of my favorite moments. handclaps cheesy? i think not! this music puts me in a really good mood. and it's psychedelic in the best way possible. it's like listening to i don't know, the cars/beach boys/zappa/beatles/dust brothers at the same time.
1	The New Rhapsody - Excellent Epic Symphonic Metal No you're not seeing things. It is Rhapsody in all their excess and you know what? It sounds pretty good. Not sure of the reason for the name change but it seems to have made them less hyper and more melodious (if that's possible). Plenty of medieval melodies, soaring vocals, backing choirs and of course, bombast. Not unlike Luc Turilli's two new separate releases sans the female lead vocalists, but not quite as good. For fans of Therion, Dreamquest, Epica
1	One of my best cds The title track "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy," alone, is enough reason to buy this album. This recording captures the electricity of this particular show to the extent that the listener may at points truly get a feeling like they're sitting in the room with the band
0	Definitely not an original band I bought this cd cuz i love the black betty tune...w/great expectation i figured their other material was gonna blow me away...wrong...Ram Jam should have named themselves Rip-OFF Jam....after listening to this cd i have concluded that they didnt't have an original bone in their bodies...the songs were a mishmash of blatant allman/skynyrd/blackfoot attempts...the vocals were without energy or feel...i can understand why they wernt sucessful where others were
1	Neu! - 'Neu! '75' (Astralwerks) Rother and Dinger parted ways for a couple of years before putting out the duo's third release.&quot;Heros&quot; sounds,to me like what MAY'VE influenced Gary Numan's early work.&quot;E-Musik&quot; is a seven minute,nice hypnotic/floating track.As &quot;After Eight&quot; progresses with it's laid back piano and mystic like vocals MORE than prove that Neu! really was ahead of their time,so does &quot;See Land&quot;. &quot;Isi&quot; could become a hit,if played in the right clubs.Dug the punk-like vocals.I always thought that that Neu! was strictly instrumental.&quot;Leb Wohl&quot; is an offbeat experimental piece that starts out with weird,but very cool sound effects,then turns into a punk song.Pretty much as mind blowing as Neu!'s first album.According to the liner notes,Rother plays guitar,piano,synth and electronics..Dinger provides the percussion,guitar,organ,vocals and keyboards.Never has one heard so much brain damaging pleasure coming from JUST two musicians
0	Hmmmm, that's all I can say... This was my first time listening to Gaelle and all I can say is "Hmmmmm"....This CD was depressing to me, all the beats were down beat. This CD would be a great buy for someone who is always in a somber mood and never has an optimistic outlook on life.
1	THERES NO LOMBARDO WAH WAH WAH Its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a 5 star average. This is quality thrash metal right here, with a slightly refined sound to it. All the songs have blistering solos, crazy as hell riffs, and of course, Paul Bostaphs inhuman drumming, which brings me to another a point. PAUL BOSTAPH IS JUST AS GOOD AS DAVE LOMBARDO YOU F-ING RETARDS!!!!!! GET IT THROUGH YOUR F-ING SKULLS. Sorry, I had to get that out. But seriously, just listen to the crazy intro to Killing Fields, his crazy pummeling in Dittohead, and his double bass madness in SS-3. This is Slayer, quality Slayer, and all the b-chin needs to stop. Im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it, like the retards reviewing Trivium and Unearth. If your like those Sepultura and Anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s, than so be it. Your loss. As for me, my favorite tracks are Killing Fields, SS-3, Mind Control, 213, and Dittohead. If my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change, get Diabolus in Musica, this, and God Hates Us All. Also get some of Pauls work with Exodus, Forbidden, and Testament if you need further proof of his excellency
1	A change of direction for the Great JT Like most of JT's work, this album contains easy listening soft rock. It marked a change of direction for JT in that it lacks the introspective, personal quality of his earlier albums. Still, it contains some very good music, backed up by some of the greatest musicians around, including Graham Nash, David Crosby, Carly Simon, Randy Newman, and saxophone master David Sanbourn. Like always, it has JT's beautifully sweet voice and laid back six string accoustic guitar. Several classic hits came out of the album including the "Mexico" and "How Sweet it is to be Loved by You." Like much of JTs work, it reminds me of the easy comfort of waking up to diffuse sunlight on a Sunday morning
0	Still Alive & Well The album is too short, mainly due to the duration of each song. Only 12 titles. Need to review personal objectives prior to purchasing
0	Driver's Seat Where the heck is Sniff n' The Tears' "Driver's Seat" in this soundtrack. It plays at a definite changing point in the movie where Floyd comes to tell Jack that he needs to switch to video instead of film. It's a travesty that this song wasn't included. But a good soundtrack nonetheles
0	The Musical Highlight Is Missing I have to agree with Greg Ippolito's review. The album is simply incomplete without Dirk Diggler's "You Got The Touch." The most significant musical moment in the film. Hard to believe it's not on Volume 2 either. A shame
0	great music, horrible sound Ken Burns and company have assembled some classic Parker takes, but the sound quality is dismal. Yes, we know these recordings were made before the advent of tape, etc.--I don't think most people interested in Parker recordings are looking for pristine studio sound, but this is a disgrace. I have many C.P. recordings, including lots of old Verve and Savoy issues on LP--none of them sound as bad as this CD. Not just surface noise, but actual musical distortion that could have been mitigated with today's technology. I was suckered into this one by the Burns affiliation, since I had enjoyed the TV jazz series. Not a fraction of the care put into that effort was expended on the CD. There is so much Parker out there today put out with more care; I would look to the Dial and Savoy sessions, for example
0	The best of? Not really. This album doesn't offer "The best of Scooter" Only the best after 1998. All the previous singles like "Move your Ass" "Back In the UK" "Fire" and "The Age of Love" are not present here. It's a allright album for starters but personally I think that the music they made from 1994-1999 was the best and many of those songs are not here, while lots of newer one's that doesn't offer you the true sound of Scooter that are here aren't very good. I own "Rough & Tough & Dangerous: 94-98" that does include some of the classics and it also offers you some wonderful instrumental trance songs that really proves the genius of this band (We don't see that very often anymore though). While songs like "How Much is the Fish" "I'm your Pusher" "Call me Manana" and "We are the greatest" are all great songs you can find them on "No time to Chill" instead, other then that, get the album I recommended instead of this that isn't really their "Best of" anyway
1	Found Some Good Gospel Bluegrass This was released "way back" in 1991, so I was not sure what I would find. Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised and out of the 24 songs, there were 9 that I gave 5 stars and downloaded to my MP3 player. That's a pretty good average for a single CD! Many of the selections were unique in that they were not "new" versions of old songs.
0	Bridal make-over music Duet featuring Barbra and the scabrous vocal stylings of Bryan Adams is the perfect background music for a bridal make-over segment on Oprah. Like other Streisand albums of late, it's overly lush and sentimental. Sometimes love does this to people
1	1990: 10 years into Maidens career.. content start to crack. Records 'Iron Maiden' through '7th Son' were incredible to me! Then came NPFTD, same cool art, content tho started to drop-off. Many of these tracks are simply sub-par & boring. 1- Tailgunner- Nice, upbeat, moving, enjoyable. 2- Holy Smoke- not exactly the excellent style of IM but still not too bad. 3- No Prayer For The Dying- eh, slow but speeds up with classic Maiden electric duets 4- Public Enema Number One- Nothing groundbreaking here but fast & true to old content 5- Fates Warning -BORING! long slow intro & should have not made it to release. Poor! 6- The Assassin - slightly better than average. 7- Running Silent, Running Deep- filler although.. the solo's are really nice 8- Hooks in you- Nice, could have fit well on their debut with D'anno 9- Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter - Not my type of material. Never liked it. 10. Mother Russia- dont really like it till the end where is really changes into a fast guitar fest. Overall not that bad.. the follow-up fear of the dark was a clear step down & then after that they hit rock bottom & have not come back. X-factor to Matter of Life & Death are just a near complete collapse of decent writing.
0	Hmmmmmm......... It's nice to see that some listeners are passionate about this album. 'Sulk' was recommended to me by a internet friend that turned me on to Modern Eon (FANTASTIC) - I took a chance thinking I had missed another fantastic 80's band - well....in this case, I didn't..... This is typical and easy to forget (thank heaven) sickly sweet and drippy 80's synth pop. This isn't synth pop like later New Order, Ultravox, Ministry's first album or even the Naked Eyes or Tears for Fears....this is Synth pop like something in the background of a low budget 80's teen sex comedy 'new wave' bar scene.... - I will say it's a hair better then anything Wang Chung ever did but only because the singing is so over the top that I actually was cracking up a couple of times with the vocal embellishments and pretention....
1	The reviewers were right-this IS beautiful! I loved the movie, but the music may even be better. My friends think so too, everybody who heard it. Look, if you liked the movie's music, and are reading the reviews to figure out if it is worth buying or not, then take my word for it, IT IS! It has all kinds of tracks: mostly chilly and dark, but also some narcotic-sounding slow ones (good for dancing) and a few brutal ones. I really recommend it, it is one of the best CDs I have. If you are feeling sad, depressed, angry or if you just had enough, this is the music to listen to. Buy this, it is essential for your collection
0	R.I.P. Dime I have nothing but the upmost respect for Vinnie Paul. It eats me up that he chose this project as his comeback to music. I can't think of a musician that wouldn't have jumped at the chance to be in a band with him. (Zakk Wylde, Maynard James Keynan, hell even Matt Heafy are a few names that come to mind) I respect what Mudvanye does. They have a formula. Not exactly my cup of tea, but it works and it sells records. So why this collaboration? why now? I can't figure it out. Glen Tribot and (insert nothingface guitarist name here) are not even in Dimebag's shadow. Their riffing doesn't do Vin's playing any justice and it shows right off the bat. The only part of this album where I hear any real connection is when Vinnie is playing the snare and high hat in 4/4. Terrible waste of such an amazing talent. As for the vocals... some of the screaming works, nothing special, just kinda sounds like Mudvayne. But on the slower country influenced songs, I fight every urge to smash this cd into a million pieces. Vinnie Paul, please find yourself musicians at your skill level and leave the amaeturs in your wake... If you like Mudvayne and enjoyed Damageplan... you will still probably be disapointed with this cd. If you are expecting Pantera, as some of these reviews will lead you to believe.. well go throw on Trendkill and feel privelaged that you were able to experience metal at its finest.
1	Not bad at all.. fills in historical gaps in JB catalog You will love this CD if you love James Brown, the JBs, Maceo, Bobby Byrd, Hank Ballard or any of the incredible musicians in their orbit during their late 1960s-early '70s heyday. Bottom line: It fills in gaps left in previous comps. It includes some rare historic moments. A few of the most notable: It starts with an oddly slowed, "rock" original version of "Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'" that evokes the stoned, slovenly funk crawl later adopted by Sly Stone in his "Riot" era. It's not especially good, but it's an intriguing opener to this lovably obscure odd-lot compilation. Hank Ballard telling fellow Blacks that they won't get any respect if they don't get rid of their "processed," or straightened (usually with lye) hairstyle, a remnant from the just-past "Negro" days. Hank says he used to wear a process but now has chosen, as a political statement, to wear a "natural" Afro, one more suitable for a beautiful Black brother or sister. (In a delicious touch of irony, backing vocals for this black empowerment anthem are provided by The Dapps, the lone all-white group signed to James Brown Productions.) Then you have Brother Bobby Byrd "Doin' The Do," a long jam that is essentially a predecessor (recorded at the Olympia Theatre in Paris!) of the JB's mesmerizing and legendary 16-minute "Escape-ism"/"Make It Funky" jam on the ridiculously essential 1971 Apollo live disc, A Revolution Of The Mind. "Catfish" Collins, brother of Bootsy, works overtime on the funky guitar. You also have a pissed-off JB, feeling robbed by a few Average White Band songs, trying to outdo The Man at his own game once again. In trying to create a Top 40 instrumental over the backing track of an old song ("Hot Pants Road"), he fails, but instead he creates a funky, almost "Superfly" soundtrack vibe that could have come from the opening music for a Quinn Martin Productions TV cop show of the '70s. And you've some of the great, criminally underrated female vocalists in the JB stable: Lyn Collins (in a fiery "Giveit Up") and Vicki Anderson. You have just about every great musician of JB's funk era represented here as well. Maybe this isn't the most essential JB compilation ever, but don't dismiss it so quickly. More than just another CD, this album is a powerful reminder of one undisputed fact. Social historians, musical archivists, scholars and others will spend the next 150 years just listening to and cataloguing the records the Hardest Working Man in Show Business was at one time able to make as easily and effortlessly as paper airplanes on a lazy afternoon. Instead of these piecemeal comps, Polydor needs to just drop a 95-disc box set of every known JB recording, with maybe a holographic soul sister research archivist (wearing HOT PANTS, no doubt) to help you sort through it all. This would be one of the discs on that set; it's not the most incendiary of them, but it is another piece of the vast and beautiful mosaic created for us by James Brown and these amazing musicians over a period of decades.

1	Barenaked music Typical country rock slash pop american music and weal vocals stick to the acting the woman whohad a hit with "bitch" back in 1997 cam back to dissapoint us al
1	Ella and Louis sing of life as we know it--and wow, how I appreciate the ride!!! On this CD Ella and Louis Armstrong join forces to make an album that is pure magic. They've been lovingly teased as satin (Ella) and sandpaper (Louis, because of his gravelly voice); but no duo compares to them when they sing together. Louis and Ella obviously enjoyed making this recording; their voices are in excellent form and impart a certain sense of genuine happiness that is hard to find. Ella and Louis have voices that are rich, vibrant and full of electricity! This CD proves it. The CD starts off with the charming and playful "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off." The album then switches gears and goes into the more soulful love ballad entitled "Our Love Is Here To Stay." Sublime! Other great songs on this CD include "Stars Fell On Alabama;" "The Nearness Of You;" "Stompin' At The Savoy;" and "Tenderly." Louis performs great trumpet solos on songs including "Tenderly" and "Summertime" that make your heart melt. In fact, every song is special on this CD; I also admire their rendition of "Under A Blanket Of Blue." The musical arrangements are very well done. These tracks feature several great opportunities for us to enjoy Armstrong's trumpet solos. The liner notes impress me, too. There is an adaptation of an essay by William Ruhlmann who wrote the liner notes for The Complete Ella And Louis On Verve. There are beautiful photos of Ella and Louis; and you get the song credits, too. A nice plus! Overall, the chemistry between Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong makes for an experience that is truly in its own league. They enjoy their work and it shows. You will appreciate their energy and powerful renditions of these wonderful songs. I highly recommend this CD for fans of classic pop vocals and fans of both Ella and Louis. This is also a great budget priced CD for people who want to know if they will like this style of music. Moreover, if you do like this CD I suggest you listen to the CD box set entitled The Complete Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong and another CD entitled Ella and Louis again. You can also try solo CDs by both Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong; they produced great music individually as well. You truly can't go wrong with this classic CD; and I hope this CD brings you the same joy and thrills that Ella and Louis communicate when they perform these magnificent songs. ENJOY!!!
1	I'm surprised that this album is so underated. A lot of people prefer blue lines over protection and I just don't understand that. I found protection to be great. Possibly one of the best CDs that Massive attack has ever released other than Mezzanine. Eurochild is mindblowingly amazing. Karmacoma, Better things, Heat Miser, weather storm and spying glass are also exceptional. The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is cause of the last track. A cover of the Doors, Light my fire that, to me, seems very pointless.
0	Music to take a bullet to The only thing I got out of listening to the title track, Protection, is fleeting remembrances of the movie The Bodyguard. This was not a good film. I am a great admirer of Tracey Thorne's voice and, as I said elsewhere, would listen to her sing the phone book; but this is not the phone book. This is teenage emotionalizing. Though I resonate with the idea of self-sacrifice, the whole point of self-sacrifice is to actually DO it, not to talk about how you would or should or might do it should the situation arise. The track is basically like listening to somebody saying, &quot;You know, I'd like totally run in front of a bus to save somebody, knowwhamsain?&quot; The whole point of self-sacrifice is that it is difficult to do. It certainly is not difficult to talk about doing, though. I don't know Tracey Thorne, but I am not really uplifted by the thought of her hypothetically jumping in front of someone to take a bullet for them

1	Motorik Masterwork, wunderbar!!!! An ELECTRIC AUTOBAHN towards the infinite... be carefull, this is veeeeeeery trippy stuff..
0	A Sad Ending for Eagles I picked this album up, expecting the same level of quality as past Eagles albums (such as the thrilling Desperado), however, it seems the only quality songs on this album are the hits, which can be just as easily obtained by purchasing the Hits Volume II, a much better album. The rest of the album is lame and uninspired, and is ultimately not worth your money
1	Best metal band to come along in a while... They're sort of a throwback: speed metal combined with elements of 70's metal, and combine to make a killer sound. I saw these guys live, they're even better in person than on the album. They have a very tight, defined sound that chugs along until you head moves in unison, they have a lot of variety in their riffs (although it's still essentially speed metal, so they don't go too crazy with variety) with head pounding vocals. When you play this, turn up the volume, you won't be sorry. My best attempt at a comparison would be this: combine Metallica's "Ride the Lightning" with Sabbath's "Master of Reality" and throw in a little Zeppelin, and that's about what you'll get with The Sword. A great up and coming metal band. I can't stop playing this album.
0	Virtuoso Guitar Playing, Complex Musical Structures! Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.
0	You can go far if you have no talent. The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead
0	no 30 sec amazon preview. 5 versions of the same song and amazon doesn't have the 30 sec preview of any of them. sooo it's an import ??? where is the international version of the music video?
0	Meh First off...the Pink Spiders are in no way punk. Secondly, this music is so polished and poppy it lacks any type of genuine feeling to it. Third, the whole "pink" gimmick can only take you so far...even Pink had to change her hair color. I guess for fans of pop music this band will make you excited, but for me it just makes me ill
1	Love Reba! I'm not a huge country fan but Reba McEntire is great! She's an amazing musician! This album has a great collection of songs on it! My favorites are "You Lie," "For My Broken Heart," and "Is There Life Out There." Super album...highly recommended!
0	F U R M After seeing Reba rip the Dixie Chicks on the awards show tonight, F U R M is all that needs to be said. She's a no-talent, fugly, brain-dead hillbilly who should be working in a convenience store somewhere instead of being given a platform to take shots at real musicians who aren't even in the room. Go back to the Ozarks RM. We won't miss you at all
1	Good greatest hits package This is some of Reba's best material, and there isn't a bad song on this CD. Some of the best songs on here are, "You Lie", Rumor Has It", "Is There Life Out There", "Fancy", "Does He Love You", and "Walk On". All of these songs except for "Fancy" were #1 hits. The only downside to this album is that it is missing LOTS of songs that were either No. 1s or top tens. All in all this is a good album and I would recommend it to Reba fans
0	'Double-time' to Cadence This recording is NOT meant as workout aid. The cadence is 'double-time' (equivalent to a 'jog') not 'running.' The numerous jody snippets (and that is what they are) on this and I would assume similar recordings are meant to fill a special niche in music; that being the archiving of the military's equivalent to sea chanties, road gang and field songs. They make hard, boring, repetitive work go easier. God knows pounding down a road for ten miles with a full ruck is a challenge physically and mentally. These recordings would be much more useful workout-wise if, rather than snippets, they were longer. There are a couple of DIs though on this recording that have REAL talent; good 'lyrics', good voices and a hell of a lot of character. As an aside; my the military has certainly become PC since the 60's! These jody's aren't anything like the ones I recall from boot camp - with only one exception that pops to mind. (My '2 Star' grade is for missing the mark as a workout aid. I'd give it '3 Stars' for what I call it's archival 'potential' which could be improved substantially.
0	Not that great The only song I like on the album is "For These Times"...the rest of the songs are crummy. Her song "Anyway" just gets on my nerves. The album sounds like pop/rock/opera/ONE BIG MESS!!!! Martina can't sing a damn note and this album sounds terrible! What the hell went wrong here? Don't waste your money! Buy Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood and Dolly Parton
1	My Intro To The Elements Of The Universe! Though I know they made 3 albums before this one with an early line up of some of the best jazz players of the time and future jazz players even (Hubert & Ronnie Laws)... 1973's "Head To The Sky" was my first introduction to the elements of the universe aka Earth, Wind & Fire! They are my all-time favorite band and this is the album that started that love affair between them and myself! In 1973, I was a 9 yr old kid who was developing my own burgeoning musical gifts, and boy, was there so many great musical mentors from that time to follow... Stevie was in the middle of his incredible creative run with "Innervisions" taking the world by storm! Donny Hathaway was at his brilliant peak with the now iconic "Extensions Of A Man".. ( I miss Donny!) WAR was groovin' with "Deliver The Word", Sly Stone was bumpin' the airwaves with his last good effort "Fresh", a pre-mothership Funkadelic was ripping it up and slightly freaking my little 9 yr old brain out with their 1973 effort "Cosmic Slop", The Isley Brothers had revamped and were begining their incredible 70's multi-platinum streak with "3+3".... Man, it was truly a time of artistic giants and the bar was set high then! (Unlike today!) Of course I was exposed to all this and more by my mother and older cousins who were doing their thing at that time with the weed, wine and parties! But even then, my musical aesthetic was way keen and I was absorbing everything I heard at warp speed! One day my momz brought home an album with this group of smiling faces on it, adorned in the flower / peace regalia of the time and it read "HEAD TO THE SKY".. I listened intently as she put it on and the tribal thunderstorm that is the intro to "Evil" swept me up! That was the first time I'd ever heard the instrument that was to become an E,W&F staple in years to come.. the kalimba, and man could Maurice wail on that thing! I loved the atmosphericness of this album! All music was like that then, it created it's own atmosphere and took you to a heightened place. After the tribal funk of "Evil", my young ears were treated to what sounded like angels ascending from heaven as the sitar/fender rhodes intro of "Keep Your Head To The Sky" began with Verdine purculating underneath on bass and Al Mackay and Johnny Graham doing their thing subtlely. Then a 21 yr old Phillip Bailey, one of the greatest falsetto voices ever, at the height of his gifts, began to sing and I was transfixed! When that angelic sounding chorus kicked in, I felt like I had left my body! And just when I thought I couldn't go any higher.. Philip and Jessica Cleaves, who would leave the group soon after this album was released, chimed together like songbirds from nirvana! That did it!...I was disciple from then on! "Build Your Nest" was as funky as an old batch of cabbage! It had a good message and a young Larry Dunn was wearing that clavinet out big time! Then a piercing sonic interlude led to the gospel-inflected and deeply introspective song "The World's A Masquerade", one of my faves to this day! Maurice was holding church!..laying down his story of how humanity is hypocritical & phony at times, and Phillip and the choir was testifying in the background! It was pure rapture to my ears then and still gives me chills now, some 33 yrs later! Side Two opened with the breezy jazzy-funk of "Clover", which was great too, followed by the latin-jazz fusion of "Zanzibar" which is like an iliad through afro-carribean music utopia! To say that this album and group left an indelible impression on my pysche is an understatement! Of course, after this one was a string of majestic and innovative material which grooved the world and made them the icons that they are! But this album was my introduction to them, and like any first love, it lingers in your memory forever! --Enjoy--
1	The best Danish woman artist Please let me recommend this album from the bottom of my heart. I have heard it about a million times, but everytime I discover something new. Tina's voice is simply beautiful. A little bit of trivia; Tina Dico's real name is actually Tina Dickow, but her name was changed to make it more appealing to the english language. Now you have something to tell your friends while listening to this superb album
1	"Safe" Debut Without a doubt the captain's most commercial and publicly attainable album. This makes it the perfect place to start or to back off to when you need a break from avant gaurd. The most prominent feature on the production is, of course, the Muddy Water, Pigpen growl of a voice that is the genius Beefheart. His delta blues mannerisms are evident throughout the album , especially in the bluesy and semi uptempo "Sure Enough and Yes I Do"; Ry Cooder covering the slide part extremely well. This is certanly blues, but not as we have all come to know and love it. The ryhthm section of the Magic Band truly shine on this recording. The bass and percussion breakdowns of "Zig Zag Wanderer" and "Abba Zabba" are absolutely phenomenal. Proof that you don't need to show off and squese as many notes as possible into each second to sound great. Cooder does an excellent job and certanly shows his influence as well. The rest of the magic band pull together to make a good, straight ahead(at least for them) album. "Call on Me" is an interesting little pop number in the style of Otis Redding. It's one of the low points on the album, but that's not saying much. This fades directly into the in-your-face blues-rock romp of "Dropout Boogie". The lines-you wanna do what-I told you what and n' what about after that-always get stuck in my head for a while. The little instrumental dittle, ding da ding da ding, you know, that part, is pretty damn cool aswell. "I'm Glad" always reminds me of a Zappa and the Mother's song (in a good way) The thumping-hardhitting "Electricity" is a favorite of mine. The high pitched voice covering the lines- High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow deed etc.-are extremely well done. This song starts out a couple of my favorite songs on the album, including the phycadelic "Yellow Brick Road" and the amazing "Abba Zabba". "Plastic Factory" does remind me of Pigpen and the Dead playing electric blues like Big Boss Man or Smokestack Lightning. I was surprised to see that others had heard this connection, but it only makes sense. This is considered a compliment to the captain because the Dead with Pigpen were absolutely unstoppable. Beefheart is a better harmonica player and has a better style and deliverance, but Pigpen combined with the Dead certainly stand up quite well to this album on alot of occurances. "Grown so Ugly" has kind of the same effect, but it leans much more toward the Led Zeppelin side of things. "Autumn's Child" and "Where There's Woman" are great phycadelic blues ballads that wrap up the album. That ends the original brilliant album entiteled Safe As Milk, but I think the bonus songs truly add something to the album, especially "Safe as Milk". Alot of these songs, or alternate versions of these songs are featured on The Mirror Man Sessions, I May Be Hungry But I Sure Ain't Weird, and Strictly Personal(I recommend these as well). They were all originally going to be on a double album called "Plain Brown Wrapper" and would be better in this form. These song's are the Captian's beginings into wierd phycadelia and add alot to the straight ahead feel of the original album. They show a true progression towards Trout Mask and Lick My Decals Off, the pinnicle of beefheart and the Magic Band's work. Overall this is the perfect album for a begginer or long time fan who needs a break from the sometimes esoteric music of later albums
0	Smooth Jazz Sucks I hate to take the time to write this on here...but, as far as I am concerned Smooth Jazz is a sad excuse for music. I am an avid jazz fan and musician. Smooth jazz is a joke
1	Very live Dead The old bromide said it all...on a good night, there really was "nothing like a Grateful Dead concert," and that held true for both their acoustic and electric sets. RECKONING captures some of the best moments of their 1980 Radio City Music Hall and San Francisco acoustic sets, and they've put several winners on here. "China Doll," "To Lay Me Down," "Bird Song," "Cassidy" and "Ripple" are particularly outstanding, but except for a somewhat dirge-like "It Must Have Been The Roses" (c'mon, Jerry, pick up the tempo!), everything here shows these ol' reliables at their unplugged best. What else is there to say? The Grateful Dead may be gone, but the music is as present---and as timeless---as ever. Some of the best of it can be found here
0	Where's the beat? I bought this CD and was dissapointed that the song I heard on the radio which had an uptempo steppers beat was not on the album. Instead I got a cd full of elevator music that quite frankly is sub-par at best. If you like that sort of thing then this is for you
1	Derailers - Soldiers of Love This is my first Derailers album. I had heard of them before, but never really wanted to buy an album. I think I've been missing out on a great band! Derailers' "Soldier of Love" is good - really good - I'm tempted to give it 5 stars but that'll be determined if I'm still listening to this 5 years from now. For now though, this is great "Americana" music. This is what real music is about. This is where country music started, where it has evolved to, and it's nice to see how it can still sound good in the year 2006. The songs are really good throughout - start to finish. The lyrics and choruses are very catchy without being cheesey - except for the "Get 'Er Done" song - That phrase is so played out by now, you'd think they'd have known better. This album takes honky tonk, country, rockabilly, and mixes them all together to make a great album. It's a record for good times and cold beer. It's nice to hear real good, quality "country" music every once in awhile
0	A Pathetic Stab at Mediocrity Instead of buying the whole album, do yourself and your wallet a favor by only downloading only one song considering they all sound exactly the same. On the other hand, if you like talentless droning, lack of depth and variety which can only be compared to watching the landscapes change while driving through Nebraska, then feel free to waste your money on this mockery of an album
1	5 stars is not enought... I own every Danzig-era Misfits release and to me this is hands down the best one of them all. A solid album with 17 awesome tracks plus a bonus track of studio screw ups. Every song on here is a great listen plus the sound quality isnt that bad compared to his other recordings. There are alot of reviews claiming Walk Among Us is there defining masterpiece but I disagree; its great but not as great as Static Age
1	I highly recommend this CD Yolanda Adams' Christmas CD is simply beautiful. I love the arrangments of all the songs on this disc. I can listen to the whole CD over and over again. Her rendition of The Christmas Song is my favorite. You will not be disappointed with this album
0	Ridin Low Living Legends was good but did you think that Puffy was going to let this legendary duo out of Memphis make another album without a harmful pop vibe attached to it? You dont know Pus Daddy very well. Relax And Take Notes, Cruisin, Runnin Out Of Bud, Get Low and Stand Up are the only tracks that are worth checking out. This is the rest of the album. Filler: Ridin High(fruity commercial joint, sounds forced, I hate puffy so much right now), 30 Rocks(the hook doesnt make any sense plus who told Diddy Kong it was cool to bust a verse?), Hickory Dickory Dock(worst hook since.......Yung Joc's I Know You See It!), Clap On(speak of the devil, Dumb Joc makes a lame appearance on this dead track), Memphis(sampling a hillbilly tune? Who let them do it? The worst ode to a city ever), Alcohol P**** and Weed(worst hook next to Hickory Dickory Dock) etc. Bottom Line: This is the worst album Ball & G ever made. Their rhymes and hooks for most of the songs were weak and their guest appearances were pretty tame. Signing with Puffy at the time might have been a good look for them now its a negative look for them. Puff Dookie cant stand to have rappers on his label that are not as commercial and pop as he is. If the first Boyz N Da Hood was alright you can almost imagine how bad the next one is going to sound. Support every album Eightball and MJG made on SuaveHouse Records(including In Our Lifetime, their best album) and stay away from this train wreck of an album.
0	Blame Puffy It is sad that these two southern hip-hop legends good names have been blemished by Bad Boy records. The transformation from their classic hit "on the outside looking in" along with a host of other great albums to this disgrace is quite sad. I'm sure your boy puffy offered alot more money and fame than they have ever had in the underground, and it hurt 'em. Some will say "well thats what you get for being a sell out" but if your in the game making underground hits for almost 2 decades and your only know to a small region, you may not feel the accomplishment or respect you deserve. I forgive them, not Puffy. Buy some of their old stuff
1	PERFECT! This is the BEST Heart-felt Christmas Story I have seen in years. I have 2 copies of this and still had to watch it everytime it was on TV. AWESOME!!!!
1	I have a confession to make to you Josh Homme... I love you! This CD is very awesome!!! I can't through the whole CD because... I'm in love with Josh Homme... he's the lead singer from this band. His voice... is so... awesome! When I listen to his songs... I know that he's talking to me! I'm so deeply in love with him. I'll do anything for him I'll even die for him! If anything happens to him... I don't know what I'll do with myself! I hope the spell will never break. Josh... I love you... I want you to hear me sing and you can sing to me. I love you Josh... I love you. I'll kill myself for you
0	One of the worst singers I've ever heard Oh my - where did this young lady learn to sing? It's not music from an "old soul", as another reviewer put it - just bad singing. Ugg. Stay away from this one
0	2 1/2 stars-- Post punk energy music. Punk, like all great rock music, was a rebellion, in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s. BUt somewhere along the way, it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against-- in the case of XTC, the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s. But these influences were far receeded on their debut album, "White Music" is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is, more than anything else, an album of energy music. The net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band-- songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding would come later to excel at lush, detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks, textures and harmonies, but here, it's all very stripped back, ska and punk influenced pop. Moulding's trademark slithering bass isn't quite in place yet, though he's already starting to find holes to fit himself in, he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer Terry Chambers. Partridge's guitar, for his part, limits largely to angular punk and ska trends-- loud and aggressive, pushing the music along from the front, which leads Barry Andrews' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band. But with all this, the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs-- Partridge and Moulding both use an unnatural, clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else, to the detrimant of the band's sound. With all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album, it still manages to hit pretty frequently, helped no doubt by the fact that Partridge's songwriting was already top notch. Standout "Statue of Liberty" best illustrates this-- hints of ska, gentle organ textures, and a funky bassline over which Partridge's clever story of unrequited love can be read out. Nearly as notable are punky opener "Radios in Motion" (full of crackling punk energy), the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single "This is Pop?" (featuring the closest Partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion, even if it is laden with great pop hooks), and new wave gem "Atom Age", with just enough of a hint of Brian Wilson to pull it above the rest. On the other hand, there's a lot of largely forgettable material-- Moulding's songwriting feels like it's not quite ready ("Set Myself on Fire") and his vocal is even more painfully forced than Partridge's ("Cross Wires"), and even Partridge has a couple duds ("Spinning Top"). Add to this an ill-conceived ska take on "All Along the Watchtower" that makes Partridge sound like a bad Hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package. The reissue adds quite a bit to the original-- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there's seven bonus tracks-- early singles and the "3D EP". Most of this stuff is largely forgettable (Moulding's "Heatwave", Partridge's "Dance Band" and "Traffic Light Rock"), but early single "Science Friction" and its b-side "She's So Square" are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen. XTC would find enormous heights in the following decade, and I can't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they'd eventually reach. I have a sneaking suspicion that had I not heard what they'd be capable of in the future, I'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating, but compared to their later work, "White Music" sounds positively amateurish. It's got its moments, but they'd go on to do a lot better
1	I agree... make up your own mind!! I think that Carmen Rasmusen has a beautiful voice, go to her website, and listen for yourself before you go letting people that are obviously trying to sabotage her (and the American Idol show as well) make up your mind for you. I don't know where those people get that Carmen sounds like a goat. That's just crazy talk! I bet those people hurling insults couldn't sing to save their own lives. Oh... and just for the record... I'm not a family member
0	Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer (Not AT ALL worth Import price) This is the song that I keep singing to myself EVERY TIME I buy another Falkner record (exceptions being the Holiday single, & the Sub Pop set), or any other offering of ANY kind from ANY member involved with the best band of the 90's (Jellyfish). And I didn't discover them POST break-up, oh no....I was in the fanclub and wore the advance copy of Bellybutton (Vinyl, yo!!) out on my college radio shift! I was also in the Redd Kross fanclub and consider them HIGHER than the Jellies...yeah, I said it. So, you can bet that I had a raging "you-know-what" in my pants for THIS record!?!? Import price and a long wait from Japan later, and I am once again...let down. It has been painfully obvious for a while where the magic dust came from within Jellyfish, and this is another testament to Andy Sturmer's greatness. I know, they weren't trying to make a Jellyfish album, but the songwriting here doesn't hold the slightest flicker to say, even a Beatnick Beatch tune. If The New Cars had hired Faulkner (who rhymes as bad as Ace Frehley in spots), instead of Rundgren, and they went with the songwriting of 'Door to Door', this would be VERY close. This goes beyond "having a retro sound" and straight into Justin Timberlake trying to have a retro sound. Better yet, if you actually enjoyed ANY of Duran Duran's last two records, then this will knock your socks off....in fact, send ME $30 and you can have this copy. Production quality and my sincere love for the past with these three guys, keeps me from comitting this review to ONE star
1	Should be "Madeleine Holliday" If you like the sound of Billie Holidays, voice you will be floored by the similarity in Madeleine Peyroux. I hate to say it but her voice sounds almost identical but has more range. The music style isn't totally that old classic jazz sound but similar; some songs seem tinted with a New Orleans sound and some a tiny bit folk-like. Over all smooth, delightful songs. Not one of them is annoying which is lucky when buying an unknown cd
0	misfits meets the nutley brass WHY
0	Same old songs. Nothing rare here. Just the same old hits recycled into a new package. I would have thought VH-1 would have dug up some unreleased tracks or remixes, but nope. You are better off buying "The Best of Rick Springfield" -- it has all these songs and is also remastered
0	'Fly' not good enough to carry this one I thought this album might be decent based on 'Fly,' but it is amazingly garbage. The only song besides 'Fly' that I thought was good was Speedhome California, maybe because it talks about California and I live here. But sadly this album is not worth the $2.99 I paid for i
0	why listen to this garbage? honestly, all her songs are sexual in some way. the way she poses, moves, dresses is wrong and sends the wrong message across. she is unmodest, makes herself into some sex toy on stage and videos, cant sing to save her life. Rebecca St. James is definetly a good alternative that has enough self-confidence in her looks and voice that she doesnt have to wear a [...] outfit on all her albums or cover-up her voice with a computer. get her Transform album. Great pop/rock/teckno-style music with a good message, better voice, and in my oponion, better looking artist.
0	Enh, it's OK Watered down folk-psych circa 1968. If you think Country Joe and The Fish is too hard rock then this is for you. Too too flower power and not very imaginative, in fact it's rather boring. Perhaps it should be retitled Exile On Yawn Street
0	What a disapointment! Clearly the worse she has ever came out with! Only one good song on entire CD...
0	Virtuoso Guitar Playing, Complex Musical Structures! Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.
1	Atmospheric... oniric.. contemporary ambient I am in my early forties, and this album I hear in a cd store some years ago while browsing.. i just could not help appreciating the surreal sound of this music, I just had to get it.. get some good wines, get together with your friends, this is perfect ambient music .. in the road while its raining and you really need your to be in a different world.. this is the musi
1	like this CD this is a good CD. but it is missing something(s) treat me right and crimson and clover. Pat did a good job on both of these songs.
1	Yes indeed, EBM is Dead It has been a long while since I last submitted a review on amazon because I have been calmly waiting for that divine inspiration to catch me off guard when I least expect it. You see, I had been in a bit of a funk lately, as I'd found myself in what was shaping up to be a sizable drought in regards to finding some new music that really moved me, both inside and out. Enter: Neuroticfish. As menacingly delicious as Mr. Sascha himself, this fish has one potent bite. Honestly, who knows what genre this type of music truly fits into; synthpop, future pop, new wave, darkwave, ebm, industrial---it's all electronic and good from my perspective. However I must also admit that like one of the previous reviewers, I am quite picky about what I will listen to and enjoy. It takes a lot more than a few 'hot beats' blasting out of a subwoofer to make me happy. The comparisons to Apop, VNV, etc are all relevant, but while I am familiar with and respect those so-called "Top contenders of the EBM scene," I feel that Neuroticfish music posesses a depth and vibrancy to it that is fresh, exhilarating and immensely satisfying, which is more than what I can say for any other "EBM" band. The music pumps and throbs with all the seasonings of top notch dark, dance club beats and is also MELODIC, which seems to be a commodity that often places it into the classification of synthpop, which of course automatically gets the label of being too wimpy, poppy, sappy to be labeled as EBM(And I thought goths were picky.) But alas, it's not until we hear Sascha's deep, butterflies-in-stomach-inducing voice that the magic truly begins. He sings with a variety of colorful emotions that range from heart wrenching and tinged with animmosity to tastefully demented("They're coming to take me away" is a song that my mother described as being freaky, disturbing music of a carnival gone quite wrong, ha ha) and melodic(Yes, that deep baritone DOES sometimes resemble David Gahan, which is the highest compliment that one can possibly get from me.) This music has the intense, catchy, and emotional clout of first rate synthpop combined with the deliriously ecstatic dance riffs of EBM. Standout tracks are the intense "I don't need the city," "Waving hands,"The bomb," "They're coming to take me away," and "I never chose you." Pretender and not a contender? I doubt Sascha is trying to distinguish himself as a product of any 'scene' anyway. Afterall, EBM is dead =)
0	Uccchhh, they called these three &quot;the talented ones&quot;! I ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80's best contributers to the synth-pop genre, Human League, said that on the audio liner notes portion of their &quot;Very Best Of&quot; album. The three former members of this group left in the early '80's and formed their own music group, being Heaven 17. I'm sorry to say that, having listened to this album one night this past week, I find the CD's entire song selection, in my opinion, to leave a whole lot to be desired. I don't even remember any of the titles, and I can't understand how any of these purely mediocre tunes ever could have been a hit in any country. That is essentially it for me, the reason I didn't give this album only one star is that, thankfully, it's not the absolute worst I've ever heard. I don't think that my taste in music could possibly be that bad, I've got taste, decency, dignity, integrity, and a reputation to uphold after all
1	Lost Pastoral Serendity... Forest is a low-key folk group that is in line with Incredible string band, but in my opinion, they are even better. This 2 CD package is a very wise buy as it's full of wonderful and amazing music. 3 guys are all talented multi-instrumentalists and their compositions sounds like the Renaisance folk songs! Very beautiful, fantasy, dreams, love themes incorporated seamlessly in this package. Best Cuts: Graveyard (CD 2), Bad Penny (Opening Track of CD 1)...etc. In general CD 1 is even better, of course, both CD is fresh and never boring
1	Happy surprise I had read some negative things about this album. I am a diehard Stones fan and wanted to include it in my collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this album. It is pretty fantastic! I would recommend it highl
0	Why on earth is this listed under classical music? Pavarotti has a short but excellent repertoire that belongs in &quot;Classical Music&quot; (e.g. Fille du Regiment), however 99% of his recordings belong in Popular Music. Amazon folks, please get your act straight on this guy and his other two tenor friends
1	Brent Mydland's finest hour I think "In the Dark" is the best studio disc the band did with keyboardist Brent Mydland. He sounded tentative in his singing on "Go To Heaven," and I don't think his songs on that album stand up to his contributions here, especially "Tons of Steel." In fact, the three major writers -- Mydland, Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia, with their respective lyricist partners -- all acquit themselves well on this disc. Garcia's "Touch of Grey" and "Black Muddy River" are his strongest tunes in years; you have to go back to the better parts of the "Terrapin" suite to find anything as significant from him. Weir's "Hell in a Bucket" and the outtake "My Brother Esau" have a gritty, churning resonance. As some have pointed out, this was NOT the Dead's final studio album; "Built to Last" followed. Mydland had more songs on that one, but I think he was overrepresented; then again, maybe that was necessary, as Garcia's stuff on that disc was pretty weak. In short, as far as the studio is concerned, I think this was the Dead's last great statement; I would have been quite content if "Built to Last" had never seen daylight. "Black Muddy River," then, isn't the last song Garcia ever would sing in the studio -- but maybe it should have been. What a hauntingly proper final tune it would have been for him
1	AAAAAAHHHH! Thanks Vicki, for being obedient. You recorded some songs that I had heard of (He's been faithful, IN the Presence). I wasn't prepared for your record to be solidly a blessing. Don't take that as an insult, but I was tempted to only listen to those songs, but I said "Christian, you need to just listen to the CD." From the start, it tells me the direction of the record, and it's an awesome dedication to the lord" It gives me tools to worship with, thanks for staying in the industry and minsitering. Also, your child is cute
1	The best SAMIAM record ever! This is as good as it gets folks. This is one fantastic record. I could not list the best songs because they are all good. The vocals are absolutely awesome. I love the sound quality, production, and dynamics of this record. I highly suggest that you pick this one up
1	Magnum Opus If there's one CD that I'd call Jill Sobule's magnum opus, I'd say that it'd be Happy Town. There's so much good material here
1	Party vibe - instant fun Beck's best at his hippest, funkiest, top. Put this CD in your player and a party is virtually bound to start. Unlike almost any other pop artist Beck oozes talent and imagination. He shrugs off convention and creates an amalgam of musical styles that always seem to fit just right. Each of Beck's new CD's always seem new and some fans of his earlier works might not like this new one but if you like any kind of dance or funk there's a whole lot of fun here. Mixed Bizness gets my vote for the best.
1	Toothsome Pop the box and you see an Egon Schiele drawing, an attenuated early modernist nude wearing her anxieties on her skin. It's a fitting visual reference, for the Willowz are a nervous band, also a raw, ambitious, self-challenging, brilliant and perplexing one. They have great hooks, a gift for casually tossing off little bits of humor and beauty, and this timeless unselfconscious quality that's easier heard than described. In the bland stew of indie rock, the Willowz are a toothsome morsel. (review from Scram Magazine #21
0	Import in Disguise Wouldn't recommend this at all, most of the songs are not the original recordings but Johnny must have redone them on a tired day in the studio. Others are from live concerts. Save your $$
0	warmed-over weather report What really struck me on first listening to this, was the superficial resemblance to old Weather Report recordings (this was before I actually got to the WR cover of "Boogie Woogie Waltz"; I subsequently listened to the original on Sweetnighter, which turned out to be far superior in every way). Part of the problem with this recording seems to be the ... musical ideas expressed on here; subtract Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, and various WR drummers; replace them, and this is what you come up with. I almost had to turn it off when I heard those "cheezy" electric keyboard settings on a couple of tracks. A second listen (I always listen at least twice before getting rid of a recording), confirmed my initial assessment. Mr. Mcbride is a monster bass player, but this was almost embarrassing; he would have been much better off actually hooking up with Shorter, Zawinul, and company in a Weather Report revisited project. That would be really good
1	All hype aside... This albums rocks. Nothing is more brutal than Black Flag when fronted by Rollins. In my opinion, this was Black Flag at their punk best. Not much can be said about this album that hasn't already been said. I highly reccomend anyone even slightly interested in getting into hardcore get this album, it's a rush from start to finish
0	Sorry ... Not One of DL&Q's best I really enjoy Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, especially their gospel music. This is their first release for Rounder Records. I suspect the content and flow of this album represents a strong influence by the record company and not the usual freedom which Doyle Lawson has had in the past to pick the song lineup. Perhaps they were just trying to "break the mold" so to speak and stay away from heavy gospel content. I'm not sure where that came from, but to me it causes this release to come across as forced and mechanical rather than natural and flowing. Don't get me wrong, the musicianship and especially the vocals are top notch, but for me this does not make up for the material selected for this release. Go back and listen to some of the soulful and sincere music from their previous releases and then compare it to this album. I will be going back to listen to Rock My Soul and the older DL&Q material and You Gotta Dig a Little Deeper will probably be a very infrequent visitor in my CD player. If this is how DL&Q is going to be with Rounder, then in my opinion we would all have been better off without that relationship. - Scripto
1	Yiddish Radio Project Charming, delightful, and surprising, it evokes and energizes dim memories and resurrects the full emotional impact of memories still fresh. And LEVINE MIT DEIN FLYING MACHINE was startling in its evocation of a time when Jews were desperate for acceptance, and went to great efforts to memorialize the accomlpishments of Jewish Americans in song and otherwise, no longer content to remain outside looking in. I bought several CD's and gave them as gifts, which were big hits with all.
0	A disappointing album from a great band To preface: I am a longtime fan of INXS and own everything from Listen Like Thieves to Elegantly Wasted. Elegantly Wasted is, in my opinion, almost worse than Full Moon, Dirty Hearts. Actually, I will definitively say it IS worse. There are the gems Show Me (Cherry Baby) and Elegantly Wasted, the title track, but the album quickly runs out of gas, runs together, and seems uniformly tepid, like lukewarm water. It doesn't rock the way INXS usually rocks. It attempts to experiment like some of the earlier projects successfully did, only unsuccessfully. There aren't the hooks or the tunes to redeem it. This is disappointing because I am a fan and I want to give the band an open ear and not condemn their work. But this album, unfortunately, stinks. If you've ever seen INXS' Live Baby Live concert or listened to any album from 1985's Listen Like Thieves to 1992's Welcome to Wherever You Are, you probably concur that INXS was (and is, thanks to their newfound popularity with the Rockstar INXS TV show) a band capable of a great sound and a load of great songs. For instance, the entire playlist around 1991 was one great song after another. It was the pinnacle of the band's career. Michael's stage performance oozed with charisma and sexiness, Andrew's (and Michael's) songwriting was top notch, the band's arrangements were tight and good. And then something happened. Fan reaction to X was much more tepid than to Kick, although X still sold fairly well. The band embarked on a successful tour. Around this time, grunge became huge in the global musical consciousness, and by the time of Welcome to Wherever You Are in 1992, the INXS sound was out-of-style. But ironically, that album contains some of the band's most diverse, greatest work. INXS is releasing a new album soon with their new lead singer, J.D. I hope, and am confident, that it will be a return to greatness for the band. I believe that they can still crank out bitchin' tunes once again
1	That one and only Louis Armstrong has one of those voices that no matter what you are doing, when you hear him sing, you know its him. The distinctiveness and depth of his voice is undeniable. It is a good thing this is a CD and not an album, because it would be worn out by now if it were an album
1	The Best... The Ozark Mountain Daredevils will probably always be my very favorite American band. I believe they would have been my fave regardless, but they have a special sentimental cache for me--I came from the same town they are from (Springfield, MO) and in the 1970's, we got to hear them often. The secret of the Daredevil's music was that it made you feel really good. I can't think of a single unit of musicians who so consistently produced music that can make you feel better. The music on this album, and many of the records that followed just seem to clear your head of all bad thoughts. The Daredevils are first-rate singers, musicians, and songwriters. They're just the best. Always have been, always will be...this is what American music was supposed to be about. Thanks, guys..
1	The boys of Wham! will help you reach that goal! Stuck in traffic? Got in a fight with a loved one? Somebody spilled beer on your favorite hotpink t-shirt? This album will take all of that pain away and more. Such issues as unemployment and teen pregnancy were never fun to dance to...until now! Say what you will about George Michael, but in my opinion, he is one talented man. Buy this.
0	Misleading advertising To be sure, this album has some beautiful cuts. But that is overshadowed for me by the fact that while megastars Bartoli and Bocelli are featured so prominently on the cover, THEY ONLY SING ON 4 OUT OF 16 TRACKS. This kind of misleading advertising is reprehensible. If I hadn't purchased this while on vacation, I would have returned i
1	Fond Childhood Memories I looked for years for this CD in music stores everywhere. I was so excited to find it at Amazon.com. If you love those fond childhood memories this is the Christmas CD for you. My whole family loves it! Now I'm creating memories with my kids! They love to "sing-a-long
0	I'm Still Laughing This CD is great- as a gag gift. This is a redundant piece of s**t, and I am still laughing at the amazingly cliche' lyrics. Escape The Fate is like a bad From First To Last cover band...the lead singer sounds almost exactly like Sonny Moore. This is proof that the wold is going to Hell. For good emo/screamo, pick up From First To Last's "Heroine" and Atreyu's "The Curse"
0	Please enter a title for your review It's ridiculous that any band would even bother recording and releasing such weak bland redundant excuses for songs, but what's especially disconcerting, yet somehow not that surprising, is that it's coming from a band that earlier this year released an ep of perfectly decent alt-rock emo tunes. It's not really even that i'm mourning a lack of talent in the faux-edgy music scene, but just the complete lack of awareness or regard for the difference between a song that has an actual hook, something distinctive in it that makes you want to hear it again, and just rehashing formulas, boring basic rigid commercial conventions without even 1% of variation to make it marginally interesting. These guys wrote 5 decent semi-interesting tunes on the ep, now on the album they just don't care anymore, they're just rewriting other bands songs, following formulas like it's their job, like they never knew the difference between hooks and plodding non-melodies, as if it was just blind luck that they wrote actual songs on the ep.
0	No, not so great To compare this to a Digweed, Sasha, or Nick Warren mix would be very misleading. With a few exceptions (Sugarglider, Mara), this is a very generic, flavorless trance mix. It is *not* complex. There is no groove, no soul, no build - in short, very little to keep your interest going. It's not the trance that you'll find on Digweed-Hong Kong or Anthony Pappa - Nu Breed. If you're expecting something of that quality, don't buy this. I was very disappointed in this mix, although it did give me new appreciation for the kind of mixes created by quality DJs (not Fortier)
0	Review I USE to own this CD,but, I hated it and therefor... did not listen to it much at all. I ended up donating it to the local Library
1	Takes My Breath Away This Disc is merely further proof of what the world already knows. Yo Yo Ma was in fact born to play the Cello, it is simply fantastic. It is a must own for me, It feels the air around you with such wonderful tones. Although some classical snobs might complain that this is nothing more than a pseudo Classical album, who cares. They should find the nearest emergency room and have someone remove the poles from thier *sses. No apologizes are needed hear, this disc is all that it needs to be, which is absolutely magnificient....... Peace: The*Hot*Wax*Ki
1	THE BEST BRIGHT EYES CD YET from track one to thirteen i found they we where all great. i picked up on a lot of new york influences in the writing of the lyrics. man this cd is great i got it last wednesday took a drive and haven't stopped listening to it, and now i can't wait to see him next tuesday, rather them. if you are a bright eyes fan, or have just started listening to them, or haven't heard them at all this will either a: want you to get more of his stuff or b: just listen to the cd over and over it is that good. he really brought it together with just great writing, great formations of the songs, and just overall chills when i listen to it. i know all of his albums are personal, but this one is just great.
1	Somewhere in my wicked miserable past.... ...I must have done something good. This CD truly is a gift. I've always been of the opinion that Sweeney Todd is Sondheim's best work. Certainly my favorite. So to have it revisited to this magnitude gives me delicious validation. The performances are flawless, and their voices pay beautiful tribute to their theatrical predecessors. I am a compulsive collector of musicals on CDs (71 at last count) However, I am no expert on the intricacies of the craft, I just know what I like. This CD clearly pushes to the front of my collection and takes its place alongside Les Miserables, Rent and The Producers. If you are even considering purchasing this, do it, thank me later
1	Still a fine place to enter from I have had this cd for about two years now, having bought it when I first decided I was ready to try to get my mind around the endless array of electronica music that had interested me from afar for a long time. I find myself returning to this cd again and again and it only sounds better and better with time. It illustrates the beauty of fine trance combined with fine mixing. There is only one track I dislike. I have carried this cd while traveling and will certainly draw from it when I get around to joining the i-pod nation. This collection stands very nicely on it's own but I think it lends itself especially well to newcomers and I would highly recommend it as a window to climb through into the vast world of club music
1	More Of The Same (And That's A Good Thing) The music is a bit more polished but the lyrics are just as insightful and intelligent as their previous work. When I stumbled across Bite To Break Skin on a Warped Tour CD I fell in love and Let It Enfold You has never escaped my CD changer in my car after 3+ years. This disc is a bit slower than LIEY, not a knock on them by any stretch, just an observation. Gone are subtle references to Greek tragedies, replaced by lifes modern trials and tribulations, still as potent as ever. If you don't know Senses Fail and are looking for something new to experience, I feel they are a mix of old Ataris (think Giving Up On Love, Make It Last), Rufio (think Road To Recovery), and Alkaline Trio (think Mr. Chainsaw). Along with those three bands, my musical faves also include Bad Religion, Rise Against, Tsunami Bomb, Unwritten Law and River Fenix (aka FenixTX). As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong buying anything from Senses Fail, they are phenomenally talented. If you get the chance, see them live at a small venue, they never disappoint
1	bad religion is my religion this is definently one of my favorite albums of all time. anyone who thinks punk rock cannot be intellectual, should check out bad religion, especially this album. suffer is good from start to finish, even the songs that don't stand out as much at first, grow on you and become some of your favorites. get this album or no control, they are both great. the rest of their albums are actually pretty mixed in my opinion. a few great songs and some not so great ones. against the grain is pretty good and fans of old school punk will like how could hell be any worse. the rest of their stuff, like i said is mixed, but none of it is bad. but suffer and no control, just about an hour of music, are enough in my opinion to name them great. suffer is though, probably their best. if you want thought-provoking,fast,melodic punk, or if you like pennywise you will love this album.
0	Love it, but... DONT BUY it from AMAZON! I got burned, I bought what was supposed to be the new delux edition and what I received was the original CD release. I'd rather buy items like this from official stores instead of Amazon after that hell of an experience. Over-all, its a great albu
1	Another excellent release from Moonspell Moonspell's 2003 release is another one of my favorites right next to "Wolfheart". This one is almost as good as their first but comes up short in some areas. It is their second best release, in my opinion, but doesnt have as much atmosphere as "Wolfheart" did. It's good all the way through which is important, because an album that weakens near the end is never good. My favorite tracks are probably "From Lowering Skies", "Antidote", "Capricorn at Her Feet", and "Walk on the Darkside". Here are my track ratings... 1. In and Above Men - 10/10 2. From Lowering Skies - 10/10 3. Everything Invaded - 8.5/10 4. Southern Deathstyle - 8/10 5. Antidote - 10/10 6. Capricorn at Her Feet - 10/10 7. Lunar Still - 10/10 8. Walk on the Darkside - 10/10 9. Crystal Gazing - 9.5/10 10. As We Eternally Sleep on It - 8.5/10 Overall: 94% A- It's another solid release from Moonspell. Anyone into Doom Metal would enjoy this. It's also just the way I like it, sprinkled with growling vocals and regular vocals, because I'm not a fan of songs where the screaming/growling vocals take up the entire song. Anyway it's one of their best, in my opinion, so if you have not already checked it out, you probably should.
1	Have A Nice Day; Volume 5 I noticed it's been over two years since this Volume has had a new review but that is understandable considering the age of this music however it is still fun to hear this material again and during the late 60s and most of the 70s I listened to music on the radio more than I have my entire life and that is the reason these earlier Volumes of the H.A.N.D. series bring back so many pleasant memories for me. WLS, WAKY, & WKLO were my favorite 60s & 70s AM Radio stations and they played most of these songs regularly when these tunes were on the charts and it's nice to still be able to listen to them in this new Century. Does nostalgia play a role for me?.....Definitely!.....and even though this Volume 5 is evidently out of print; it is still a good one. As a matter of fact; I think it is one of the best of this series of 25 being below only Volumes 1 & 2. A few previous reviewers have spoke highly of it and a few have spoke of it as being one of the weaker ones; then again (as I've said before) it all depends on your taste for these old songs and there are several tunes on this Volume that suits my taste. Two of them are Daddy Dewdrop's, Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It), and Jerry Reed's crossover hit, When You're Hot, You're Hot. Both are very upbeat & halarious. One of my favorite 70s bands was Hamilton, Joe Frank And Reynolds and they are also here with, Don't Pull Your Love. Murray Head's, Superstar, is a tune I hadn't heard in 30 + years and sounds great and Chase's, Get It On, (Not to be confused with T.Rex's, Bang A Gong; Get It On) is a fantastic Rocker. Although I like The Beatles Abbey Road version better; Richie Havens version of, Here Comes The Sun, also brings back fond memories. Another talented artist on this Volume is Lobo singing one of his big hits being, Me And You And A Dog Named Boo. Mike Curb Congregation's, Burning Bridges, is a good tune I probably haven't heard since it dropped off the charts back then. 60s Legends; Tommy James, and The Raiders are also here with their huge hits; the Top 10, Draggin' The Line, and the # 1 smash, Indian Reservation, (in that order) and speaking of 60s Legends.....The Fortunes are also here with the stellar, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, and that song is the standout on this Disc.....Whew!.....Volume 5; a weaker version?.....Not To Me! This is an out of print (but strong)Volume. Have A Nice Day; Volume 5 = 4 1/2 Stars
0	SCARY I SAW THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE CATHY RIGBY, &quot;WHO WAS BORN TO PLAY PETER PAN&quot;. I HATED IT A LOT. SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE &quot;CREW&quot; WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE
0	ABSOLUTLY AWFUL ! Is this for real? It sounds like John Tesh or Harry Connick Jr. I just got this CD and it put me to sleep. It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again
1	One Hour of Hip Hop Scratchology.. Clocking in at a little less than 60 Minutes, 'Scratchology' will definately take you through the study of Scratching importance in Hip Hop history. The next time you're thinking of taking a drive or a walk, pop this CD in your player and let it ride, because it will definately take you down memory lane with flavor added by The X-Ecutioners
1	Roy's Favorite This was recorded during a tour of Japan in the late 70s. Roy stated that of all the albums he released this was his favorite-many of the others he refused to acknowledge. Listening to this CD helps the listener understand why Roy thought so highly of this album- Roy was on that night and the band was tight. My only complaint is that the whole show isn't available. This is the editted show, some 46 minutes of the two hour event. Still if your a fan of this amazing guitar player you owe it to youreself to pick this CD up along with American Axe to hear this guy make that guitar cry
1	Hard Rock that Rox this is an Amazing CD too bad they didn't get the attention they richly deserve I recomend this CD to fans of 3 Doors Down,Seether and Nickleback

0	This SHOULD be endangered. I wouldn't have bothered if not for the fact that there was only one review for this cd giving it 5 stars...a real injustice. This is a piece of garbage, plain and simple. If you liked their first cd you'll prolly wana smash this into little pieces and then hunt down every member of the band, no joke. The guy has a horrible voice and it's only good when he yells, which is maybe in 2 songs on this cd, both of which fall apart after the heavy point. PURE GARBAGE, if you don't believe me buy it and see for yourself, there's a reason this cd isn't as popular as Through The Eyes and its cause IT SUCKS
0	Very relaxing except for the birds The sound of the water rushing over rocks on this CD is very relaxing. The only problem is it also has the sound of birds chirping which is very annoying. I did not hear these birds chirping when I first played the sound sample on Amazon.com. So if you are thinking about buying the CD for the sound of water alone, you may want to look at a different CD
1	a classic I love this album! I see in the discussions someone said you would only like this if you are "bitter and angry"...well, that's not me...and I LOVE THIS ALBUM. Shirley Manson is amazing. Not only is she gorgeous, she is a fabulous singer, and a great, intelligent writer. Although I don't agree with all the philosophies she puts into her songs(though yes, I'm anti-war and think she articulated in "Boys Wanna Fight" what's going on really well, I don't think a "free love" revolution will solve anything on personal or political levels..."Sex is not the Enemy" is a great song music-wise though...end tangent), I think she's a great example for women in many ways. We're not all waiting for a man to come along and "make it all better." We're not all demure. Shirley's lyrics express that in a society that does not accept it. Go Shirley. I have heard people complain that this album is more straight-up rock n'roll and less "electronic" than 2.0, but that is the hallmark of a great band. The Beatles had "Sgt. Pepper" as well as "Let it Be". Led Zeppelin did "Black Dog" as well as "Tangerine." Great bands have range. Garbage is the only band I love that came out of the 90's. And they're still rockin' in the 2000's. Listening to this album has helped me alot through some recent times. There are some very uplifting songs, as well as some songs that are so deep, true, and sad that they make me cry. Beautifully written. I saw Garbage in concert in Spring '05. Shirley Manson is even more jaw-droppingly captivating in person. Rock on, Garbage! And thank you for all the great music.
1	A Work of Art. Masterpiece. What an album. Easily one of my favorites. It's one that deserves to be listened to on a high end music system. I have my albums that I like on my iPod, or in the car. This is one I like to dedicate my time to without distractions. Bought it the day it came out and has only gotten better with time. My musical tastes usually fall within the electronic/downbeat domain (Air, Boards of Canada, Herbert, Fila Brazilla, Autechre..etc) I do own Listen Without Prejudice, but Older is a much more sophisticated, well rounded album. Mr. Michael's vocals are smooth and lush. First review I've ever done on Amazon, couldn't have picked a better album to start with.
1	Jump at chance to be at Walter Trout & the Radicals gig If you are looking for a man and a band who can give you everything they've got; look no further. If you are searching for music that will sear into your soul; look no further. Walter Trout can play his guitar up there with the best of them. He can also DO things with a guitar that will leave you speechless. In his hands, the instrument can wail, talk, cry, moan, whisper or do anything he asks of it. His singing voice is powerful and comes from the depths of his heart. He truly presents his all to you in this live performance CD. His energy will be transferred to you and be engraved into your memory and you will be grateful you found your way to the performance venue of this remarkable musician and his band. The next best thing to being there is this 2 CD album
1	Just Listen! I read some of the other reviews and thought it was kind of silly for people to try and analyze which BG album is better....what does it really matter? This is a great(band)and they create thoroughly terrific music. I happen to think that Talk To La Bomb is pretty fantastic, unlike anything else that is out there. Let's remember just how horrible and bad the music industry is right now and let's just enjoy talented musicians like BG that go unnoticed for the most part,except by critics and nobody listens to them anymore either!
1	This is the best for dancing to i can't stop dancin to this!it's the BEST ever i can't help it well i'm to busy dancin and maybe u will 2
1	Bing was unquestionably the king of Christmas music There are plenty of Christmas CDs by Bing Crosby that you could get, most of them are at least as good if not slightly better than this one. However, one very good thing about this CD is that it provides Bing Crosby in very good voice singing Christmas standards at an excellent price. These recordings were from old radio shows, and, while that means that there is a mild radio hiss in the background. I personally think that this adds a little magic and character to the CD. If you agree and are on a somewhat limited budget, then you should definitely think about adding this Crosby classic to your Christmas collection
0	Disney Karaoke Vol.2 [KARAOKE] Quite disappointed that there are no screen lyrics available. Although some say karaoke is merely singing the lyrics to the instrumental version of the song, modern day tapes and cd's *do* include the &quot;CDG&quot;. Disney seems to fall behind the times. You're better off with a sing-along video -- at least then the kids might learn to read (or at least recognize words). My 4 &amp; 2 year olds wouldn't know what to do with just the instrumental version, of 'true' karaoke. I do prefer vol2 over vol1 or vol3
0	undeserving of praise my inability to see what's so great about this album does not stem from my lack of experience with "experimental" or "electronic" music. nor does it reflect my feeling about bands that change their sound on every album. the problem with this album is that it lacks what ulver are ordinarily pretty good at. when they explored the folky territory of kveldssanger, the raw black metal of nattens madrigal, and even the ambitious and remarkably diverse william blake album, they slipped more effortlessly into the style. a few "soundscape" albums, and a couple more blippy ep's later, they come up with this mess. and i say mess, because that's really what it sounds like to me. it's as though they wanted to hang onto some of the elements of "quick fix for melancholy" but incorporate the experimental weirdness of label mate when (yes, that's the name of the band: when), almost to a worshipful extent at times. unfortunately the result isn't nearly as brilliant, in my opinion, to the aforementioned solo project. rather it sounds like a bit of a monstrosity that's been shined up a bit by garm's silky crooning (the silkiness of which gets on my nerves after a short while). of course, this is my opinion. i don't ordinarily find it necessary to write bad reviews like this, but when i see something like this that isn't really all that unique or amazing get a lot of praise, it rubs me the wrong way.
1	underated This is a great album, it's a mixture of pop and rock. The first side is flawless, but side two let's us down a bit. Actually 'coming soon' is the only song I don't like on this album. The game is queens first and probably best 80's album
1	The road to future greatness In 1963, the Kelly/Chambers/Cobb rhythm section packed up and left, leaving Miles Davis without a band. Despite being at an age when most musicians would rather sit on their laurels and play on some giants of jazz tour, he decided to assemble a new working band. This CD shows that assembly in progress. The three ballads were recorded in LA with George Coleman (tenor sax), Victor Feldman (piano), Ron Carter (bass), and Frank Butler (drums). &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot; is very different from Louis Armstrong's version -- Davis's trumpet playing is much sadder, merging abstraction and the blues. But the real treasures in the set are the three tunes recorded one month later with Carter, Coleman, and two younger musicians: pianist Herbie Hancock and drumming prodigy Tony Williams. Williams, only 17 years old here, generates an incredible level of excitement on &quot;Joshua&quot; and the title track. These may be the most exciting up-tempo tracks Davis had recorded since &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot; and &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;. The quintet with Coleman, Hancock, Carter and Williams would soon evolve into one of the trumpeter's greatest groups, and this is where they got started
0	Its okay Ya this CD is okay. Its just really generic nu-metal. I like nu-metal a lot its just some it sounds the same and brings nothing new and that is Linken Park. I don't hate this, I just think it is kind of boring and not that cool. Partially why this does not get 3 stars is that since this band got so big for a while you kind of expect it to be great nu-metal, but its just plain. Not great, not terrible
0	fresh fruit for rotting vegetables is all you really need by DK maybe frankencrist if you really enjoy fresh fruit....this is a very annoying and bad b-sides album...california uber alles and holiday in cambodia are over-produced and watered down...and where is the killer intro to holiday in cambodia? yeah i like jello biafra's voice and his mixture of funny and scary themes hit the spot, but this album consists of b-sides for a reason...aka they werent good enough to go on anything else
0	Great idea...so so execution I don't get all the rave reviews here. I've owned this CD since it came out in 1997 and its been probably more than 5 years since I had a desire to listen to it. Now listening to it trying to figure out what I want to put on my I-pod and I really can't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks, which are great. The Filter/Crystal Method track is a classic. But beyond that I just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring. I am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here, but this experiment just didn't pan out in my opinion. It's been 10 years and I haven't seen any other collections like this so I must not be in the minority. Nice try, but there is not much more here beyond the concept
0	One of the few Slayer albums that you can skip. Live Undead isn't a must have to be in your collection of Slayer albums. This record only provides evidence of the greedy Metal Blade record label. Some people say that they threw in an audience sample afterwards to create a fake live album. Well it is and it isn't. This isn't a concert, but it's a real audience. This is slayer simply rehearsing 7 of their songs from Show No Mercy and Haunting the Chapel and they brought about 20 or more fans into the studio or whatever to hear them play. On the plus side, several of these songs are played better than the originals, however the production is terrible. A possible reason for this is that Brian Slagel and Metal Blade released this without permission from Slayer, at the time they knew nothing about it. What is here is early slayer, just beginning to develop their true sound, but it's only 23 minutes in length and Metal blade is asking 17 dollars for it? But as fellow reviewer FU2 put it, Here's what they should have done, take all four Metal blade releases, remaster them, maybe add some bonus tracks and release them as 2 discs with maybe Show No Mercy/Haunting the Chapel and Hell Awaits/Live Undead or something similar. But here is the real kicker about this record that is my biggest complaint. On most early versions (Vinyl and first CD release and some Imports) there is a redone version of CHEMICAL WARFARE as a untitled track with better quality than the original that can no longer be found on this release. Why? I have no idea. If you are planning to get this, chances are you are a fanatic, and personally, this is the only slayer release that I have yet to see in a CD store. I recommend finding this off eBay, and maybe the Vinyl version as that is a picture disc and is a really cool thing to look at and features the picture on the back of the case with the band playing but with a hole in Tom's face for the record player. I give this two stars because this isn't worth the price that they are asking for. This is listenable but there are plenty of other bootlegs out there with more songs if that is what you are looking for, because that is exactly what this is. Metal blade's cash in on Slayer because as I stated before, Slayer knew nothing about this until it was released. I couldn't possibly give anything from Slayer a One star because that just doesn't seem possible, as the talent is present, but this thing just doesn't have very good sound and isn't worth the price and once again, only for fanatics. Hoped this helped. Interesting fact: That after this was released; the band called the Undead released a live album called Live Slayer
0	Outtakes of imitation folk music that didn't make the doc Hardly any of this music was heard in the wonderful documentary series. A poor album by a decent fiddler but a genuinely lousy composer
0	Virtuoso Guitar Playing, Complex Musical Structures! Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.
0	Very good musicians, but this leaves me cold Let me preface this by saying I am a big fan of traditional Irish music, and a huge fan of Dervish, Trian, Liz Carroll, Bothy Band, Kevin Burke, Andy Irvine, etc. This is the first Solas CD I have bought, and will probably be the last. Although generally very competently played, the music just doesn't speak to me. I agree with the some of the other reviews to that effect that this Solas recording is too highly orchestrated, and not very traditional (though I don't mind that, per se). In my opinion &quot;Last of the Great Whales&quot; has some of the lamest and simple-minded lyrics I've ever heard. Though she has a very pleasing voice, Ms. Scanlon's rendition of it just fails to move me whatsoever (lacking in musicality, I believe one reviewer said). In my book her renditions just don't compare to Mary Black, Susan McKeown, or Karan Casey, though they are pleasant enough. The fiddle playing on &quot;A Little Child&quot; reminds me more of a classical violinist playing Irish music....very good tone, but too much vibrato, and too orchestrated with multiple violin tracks sounding like the London Philharmonic (e.g. When My Love &amp; I Parted). On the positive side, there is some excellent guitar, flute, and button accordian playing on here (e.g. Cahil's Jig). It's as if the band is trying too hard to distance themselves from the many other traditional Irish groups, with the result that the arrangements are overly complex, and the material just isn't that interesting
0	Good, But Not Nearly As Good... :( It's a good CD, but it's not nearly as good as what Solas has done so far. They came to Portland a few weeks ago, but before I bought my tickets to the show I bought this CD. I listened to it, and was dissapointed. I decided to not go to the show, and I'm a BIG Irish music fan! It's too bad Karen left the band, because she really had a charming voice and sytle, but I have to say this new lady (I haven't even checked to see who she is!) is just not as much fun as Karen. She can sing, that's for sure, but so can a lot of people! The band's instrumental dance sets are more of the same, but I have to admit I'm getting a bit tired of the guitarist's chunky style. I did notice that the fiddler has got a bit wilder, which is great. Overall, if you are a diehard Solas fan, you'd like to own this CD. If you're a fan of good Irish music, you probably wont listen to this CD more than a few times
1	About time... Like many I owned this in Vinyl and was amazed it took so long To come out. And to those who said they found this album a little bit sappy, I say "So the hell what." Everything in that era was sappy and if your worried that a little sappiness may alter your manhood then I recommend against the purchase of this Cd. But if you want to listen to something thats gonna make you feel pretty damn good this is it. S&C have a well blended album here. The well known and recognized "Diamond girl" followed by "Ruby jean and Billy Lee"leads it off. Both were big hits and still sound good. "Intone my servant" follows and though not a hit you'll wonder why. like all the others a beautifully uplifting harmonic piece. "We may never pass this way again" another hit shows once again how S&C can change a beautifull melody and lift your soul right out of your body and make it fly. "Nine houses" starts off kinda odd (The song has a mid east flare to it) but hear it out. Vocals will come in lator and pick it up. "Standing on a mountain top" by far is one of my favorites a great countryish sound and a really great sounding guitar in this one that'll make you feel like dancing and singing to it. "It's gonna come down on you" a minor hit shoulda been "major" starts off mellow and beautifull and like most of there songs in this album just lifts you right up with an increase in tempo. "Jessica" has got to be the most sappy song of the bunch. But, Hey! my niece's name is "Jessica and It was once a favorite of mine and still is a beautifull song. ""Dust on my saddle" A country diddy that you may find yourself singing word for word after some time. "Wisdom" is the only song I never listen to its a jazzy piece and I dont care for Jazz much but even I gotta admit they do show off their talent on the horns. In short this is a great album from beginning to end (Which is rare to find nowadays) and really represents the times in which it was written (Early 70's) ENJOY
1	Vintage folk-rock tunes clearly rooted to the mid-70s Diamond Girl" is a vintage collection of folk-rock tunes clearly rooted to the mid-70s and one of the finer albums to emerge from that cluttered genre. Though Seals and Crofts were a duo, their fine-honed sound would not have caught the public's ear without the able assistance of producer Louie Shelton, who really shaped and smoothed their sound, and multi-instrumentalist Jim Lichtig, who shares writing credits for several Seals and Crofts' songs. A cast of fine session musicians contribute as well, and the set. I would say that nearly all of us who listened to the radio back when this CD was popular will always recognize the opening chords of Diamond Girl within a millisecond and drew comfort and permission from the philosophy in We May Never Pass This Way (Again). This CD has other jewels as well, Nine Houses, Jessica, and Wisdom, and all in all contains more Baha'i themes than some find comfortable. A pair of older tracks, such as Dust on My Saddle and Standin' on a Mountain Top, both penned before there was a Seals and Crofts, do not hold up as well. Note that this CD is not actually a Warner Brothers release, which may bode well for those, like myself, hoping to see more of this duo's catalog appear on CD. After their antiabortion stance on a later recording, "Unborn Child," the band's popularity began to wane and they found themselves being judged more on politics than music.
1	A bit heavy on the band side of &quot;Pipes &amp; Drums &amp; Band&quot; I bought this CD hoping to get the definitive recording of mass pipes and band playing Amazing Grace. I was not totally disappointed, but I already had a version that I think I like better which is on a CD entitled &quot;The Music of Scotland: The Scottish National Pipe &amp; Drum Corps and Military Band&quot;. The sound quality is better and the transition from the first stanza of solo piper to massed pipes in the second stanza is smoother in terms of the introduction of the drones. The arrangement is basically the same except that it doesn't have the extra flourish at the end of the third stanza before returning to the solo piper. The &quot;National Pipe and Drum&quot; CD also has more emphasis on pipes &amp; drums and less on military band than does the &quot;Dragoon Guards&quot; CD. Unfortunately I cannot find the former CD listed on Amazon. There is, however, nothing more stirring than &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; played with massed pipes--no matter which one you get
1	well done I bought this cd and fell in love with it. If your a Peter White fan Click that add to shopping cart botton
0	His Intersperced Mediocity This is not HIM's best album. It does live up to it's name because is more metal-y, but the guitars are louder, and the tunes just aren't as catchy. I would recomend "Dark Light" much more
1	Call Me In the Morning With some great recent soundtracks from "Ladder 49," "The Aviator" & "Wicker Park," I thought it would be great to revisit this classic soundtrack from 1998. "Practical Magic" holds up well 7 years after its release as a song collection. My favorite is Nilsson's "Coconut." It's interesting that the producers use his first name since he always went by just his last name on his own releases. However, that track with "put the lime in the coconut & drink it all up, call me in the morning & I'll tell you what to do" is just the classic feel good track. Joni Mitchell's "A Case of You" from her classic "Blue" album sounds at home in this set, "I'm a lonely painter; I live in a box of paints; I'm frightened by the devil & I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid. I remember that time you told me love is touching souls, surely you touched mine." Joni marries such a unique melody with poetic lyrics that any set rises from her inclusion. Stevie Nicks' two songs are both great inclusions from this enigmatic singer. "Crystal" builds nicely with her soothing vocals, "I turned around & the water was closing all around like a glove, like the love I finally found me." The opener "If Ever You Did Believe" has a lovely melody that draws you in with repeated listenings. Faith Hill's "This Kiss" had to be about the catchiest country song of the 90s & is classic in any setting. Marvin Gaye's track "Got to Give It Up (Pt. 1)" has an infectious driving beat superimposed over party sounds. Lisa Hall is not an artist I know, but this track has good energy and drive. Nick Drake was one of my favorites when he was alive. His moody folk driven melodies touched a chord as does this track "Black Eyed Dog." "Practical Magic" is an excellent collection of music. Enjoy!
1	essentially it An Amazon search of 'Essential' under music turns up over 1,700 hits. While they may not all be winners, if you're looking for an affordable one-disc compilation of Janis Joplin recordings, you couldn't do much better than this. The nice thing about '18 Essential Songs' (drawn from the 49 track 1993 box set titled 'Janis') is that a number of the selections are alternates or live versions of well-worn tracks, so you get a little different spin on the Joplin legacy. In addition, you get nearly every truly classic recording Janis ever made spanning over seventy minutes of CD space. At under five bucks for a used copy here at Amazon, you may be able to end your search here. The offerings begin with one of Janis' earliest recorded tracks, a rendition of the blues classic 'Trouble In Mind'. Although it is historic, Janis' vocals seem to be struggling to emerge from a cave. Hit the skip button after a cursory listen, and move on to the goodies. 'Down On Me', while not as deliciously raw and punchy as the live version recorded at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, certainly kicks Janis' locomotive vocal cords into high gear. Familiar studio tracks such as 'Piece Of My Heart', 'Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)', 'Kozmic Blues', 'Move Over', 'Get It While You Can', and 'Half Moon' mix with a previously unreleased version of 'Ball and Chain' (all eight minutes plus from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), an alternate demo take of 'Summertime' from the musical 'Porgy and Bess', a live version of 'Raise Your Hand' from the Ed Sullivan Show' (a portion of which made it onto the 'Very Best Of the Ed Sullivan Show' video compilation), and a nearly six-minute live wailing blues version of 'Tell Mama'. Most refreshing is the closer, an alternate demo recording of 'Me and Bobby McGee', featuring just Janis and an acoustic guitar, melting this composition down to its essential elements. 'Trust Me' is offered as one of the few non-blues or rock oriented tracks. It's a nice romantic ballad, but comes too late in the set to be breaking up whatever monotony is induced by the dominance of the blues. A few lesser-known tracks such as 'I Need a Man To Love' and 'One Good Man' might make things interesting, but are less than essential. The only 'essential song' I could without is the mercilessly overplayed 'Mercedes Benz', which graciously clocks out at 1:46 as the shortest track on the disc. '18 Essential Songs' is a compelling entry into the Janis Joplin compilation sweepstakes, which features two full box sets, and at least 10 single disc 'greatest hits' style collections. If you're not inclined to purchase one of the anthologies, however, this may well be the pick of the litter.
1	Worth every cent, penny, or other currency! DJ Kid Koala is probably one of the better DJs today, in standards of both technique and creativity. His skill allows him to take basically every quote he would like and to mix it into the flow. Texts and sounds as one, he manages to make it appear like a new, whole piece - which is exactly what a true DJ supposed to do. By Redefining the art of turntables, he has in this specific album all that's needed - a bit of dark tracks, a bit of laughable samples; and all in all, if you like the genre, this album is a must
1	All Hail Queen Latifah Knows...this album was spectacular...it is uplifting and has good beats and anybody who has the nerve to even say a fool like 50 cent or a no talent joke like ja rule is anything better than her has nerve because she is history..she is what 50 and Ja bite off of...she is what they can't live up to...so know your history before you praise the present...but queen, you gotta represent!!
1	Amazing recordings from an amazing artist It's always wise to be thankful for little miracles. That Mississippi John Hurt was "rediscovered" living only a mile away from the crossroads hamlet of Avalon, MS, deduced from the title of a 78-rpm recording he'd made in 1928, by a young guitar player from Washington, DC, named Tom Hoskins, is a miracle we all should be grateful for. That Hurt could still play and sing as well in 1963 when Hoskins found him as he did in 1928 is another praiseworthy miracle. Finally, that the Library of Congress showed the interest and was able to induce Hurt to come to the Coolidge Auditorium in DC in July of 1963 and record dozens of songs as the crowning achievement of his legacy is perhaps the biggest miracle of all, capped off with the fact that all of us now can enjoy those recorded gems with this double-CD set. Hurt was one of the most lyrical country blues artists who ever lived. He was born and lived his whole life in the Delta, yet he was untouched and uninfluenced by the great Delta musicians (Patton, Johnson, Skip James, et.al.) and their gruff, extroverted singing and string-busting guitar-playing tradition. Hurt sang in a deep, quiet voice and played intricate, even delicate, patterns on his guitar. The masterpieces from'27 (CANDY MAN, STACKOLEE, LOUIS COLLINS, NOBODY'S DIRTY BUSINESS, and, of course, AVALON BLUES) are all revived here and sound just as good as they did back in '28 (the sound, of course, is much better). There are 35 titles in this 2-CD set and every one is a beauty. John Hurt is a national treasure and these LoC recordings are a testament to his genius. Definitely grab these CDs (hopefully Fuel will issue the remaining unissued sides in Volume 2) and then get the 1928 Okeh recordings (on a Columbia CD) and, finally, check out Hurt's Newport and other post-rediscovery albums on Vanguard (on a nice 3-CD set). You will not be disappointed - the man was amazing.
1	Tapestry - Carole King THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM! This is my all-time absolute favorite collection. I have the vinyl LP from the 70s, then later I bought the cassette, and then later the CD - I even have the "Tapestry Revisited" CD (the Tapestry songs re-recorded by various artists) and coffee mug from several years back. EVERYONE should have this collection on some form
1	A cinematic return to form This is one of my favorite Prince albums. It's incredibly cinematic and creative. His voice sounds amazing and he really sounds more inspired than he has in years. The production is also fantastic. Discovering this record was one of the best music experiences I have EVER had. It was right when I was starting to explore Prince's catalogue (started listening to him in 2003). I had no idea what the record was about and the way Rainbow Children goes into Muse 2 the Pharaoh, it's beautiful. Beautiful music. There is this deep Darth Vader style voice that annoys a lot of people but to me it just adds to the cinematic quality of the record. I wish there was more music like this. My favorites are probably Rainbow Children Muse 2 the pharaoh Everywhere Everlasting now Last December. Even Wedding Feast is a fun little number. Joins Purple Rain and Sign of the times in my top 3 for Prince.
0	A flop The 80's was a really bad time for Alice Cooper. He had become a joke of his old self. He tried to do what Aerosmith did with P Vacation and comeback with a hair metal commerical album, but he flatout fails. The guitar playing isn't that bad at all, but the lyrics are cheesy making even the decent songs like Teenage Frankenstein, He's Back and Crawlin pretty much guilty pleasures. The rest of the album is pure 80's mediocrity
0	OH MY!! When I heard the song "I WOn't Stand In LIne" I thought to myself...neither will I...meaning "I Won't Stand In LIne" to buy any of this lady's music!! This CD has some of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life like the one above, "I Wouldn't Wanna Be You", and "Everything You Want". "Why Haven't I Heard From You" gets on my last nerve!! There really is not much redeemable about this release. Its got a nice cover with a flattering picture of Reba on the front of it but that's about it!! Read my mind....it stinks!
1	All Day and All Night you can listen to this set When the Wailers were signed to island records in 1972, this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience. The Wailers were already famous throughout the Carribbean, but worldwide they were nobody's. Catch a Fire changed all that. This was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out. This artwork is not original. The sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an American and English audience. The first disc is all the original Jamaican takes which are better then the overdubbed ones released originally to the world in 1972. The original Mixes have such a feel to them, and you can really appreciate why this band was so big in the Carribbean. The Wailers first album has a feel unlike any other Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, or Bunny Wailer solo album. the three of them together were simply amazing and no vocal trio will ever equal how good this band was. With the Barrett brothers on drums and bass and a young Tyrone Downie on the keyobards, this band was well on the path to stardom, and Catch a Fire was the start. If you have a music collection, you need this Deluxe Edition in your collection
1	A great sampling of Tony Rice guitar As a long-time Tony Rice fan, this CD is a great compilation of some of his best. Very good listening
1	I can't believe some people don't like this stuff! Some of the past reveiwers complained about a few things about this album, usually one of the following: 1. The material isn't new. 2. The material is unoriginal. 3. The material isn't "edgy" enough. So, here are my rebuttals to these complaints, in hopes of straigtening a few things out (sarcasm intended, since I'm sure they really don't care): 1. Of course it isn't new material, its called "I'm telling you for the LAST time." Its really more of a greatest hits performance since Jerry Seinfeld never released an album. I agree it would have been cool to have some of his earlier performances on an album, but we don't have the luxury, and I don't know about you, but I'd perfer to have my Seinfeld stand up actually documented on a disc as opposed to the previous option, one minute chunks before and after an episode of his sitcom. 2. There was a time when this actually was quite original. You see, Jerry Seinfeld got incredibly famous, and so many up and coming comedians started ripping him off that his observational comedic stylings became very common (a point beautifully illustrated in the SNL game show parody "Stand Up and Win" hosted by Jerry Seinfeld himself). If the material and style sounds unoriginal, keep in mind, Seinfeld pretty much did it first. 3. Why should comedy have to be "edgy" to be good? Jerry Seinfeld was funny without being dirty or obscene (the worst you hear in this CD is a handfull of "G-d D-mns"). I personally think that the R rated material is a crutch, if you can't be funny without being dirty, then you're not really that good in the first place. So there you have it, my takes on the complaints against Seinfelds only album. It's some good stuff really, there's a reason why people ripped off his act, and that reason is because he was a really funny, really sucessful comedian
0	Worth checking out Jerry is one of history's great stand up comedians, no doubt. That is why this is worth listening to. Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff.
1	From Rags To Beautiful Songs Tisha Campbell is a underrated actress with a big beautiful singing voice. While America gives these bitches like Ashanti, Britney, Hilary and Lindsay the limelight and pass on Tisha! Not right yall! Every song on this album is slamming. Capitol should have done a better job promoting this wonderful album. "Push" is a funky track which enlisted the help of Tichina Arnold on backgrounds. "All Good Things Come In Time" is a quiet storm classic song. "Brokenhearted" is a slice of perfect pitch heaven. "Love's Got A Hold On Me" is a sexy slow number that captivates any ole heart. So in parting, the next time somebody complains about not any real singers, cop this album. How does America think that Britney, Ashanti, Hillary and Lindsay have vocal talents? I have Britney & Ashanti. These girls need to go to vocal camp and learn a thing or two from Ms. Campbell Martin. These girls couldn't hold a candle next to Tisha's four octaves. Think about that, the next time yall complain about no talent girls
0	An absolute waste of money Do yourselves a favour kids, save your money don't go to the show,i mean don't buy this soundtrack. Here are some tips about it. It runs for a mere 29 minutes. That's awfully short. There are 8 songs and 8 portions of dialogue. most of these portions of dialogue last a few seconds, radio announcements of songs. The best portion is the harvey keitel bit, 'if the manager thinks he's Charles Bronson, cut off one of his fingers'. The songs now. Little green is a decent enough song, cocunut is a good song. i gotcha is okay. Stuck in the middle with you is a good song but has been ruined for me because it has been played to death on tv and radio. The other 4 songs are a joke. so basically it's a total waste of money. The pulp fiction soundtrack is a lot better than this one. Stop
1	Old songs - Great sound still resonates Nostalgia filled me as I listened to some of the most eloquent and poignant songs ever written and sung by the infamous Michael Hutchence, taking me back to the age of sixteen and absolutely loving the passion that surrounded this band. It was great to be re-aquinted with songs that opened up wonderful memories and experiences. Definitely a must have for any CD collection
0	AN ABSOLUTE CRIME One of the few documentaries that has actually meant something to me and generations of like minded folks. It is such a shame that this is the best that could be done as a means of representing the movie. Were Kazaa alive today I would create my own cd following the chronological order of the closing credits. Well, worse has been done (i.e. Bush + Iraq) so I should not complain, but instead I'll protest and not buy this incredibly lame misrepresentation of an incredibly well made documentary
0	OH NO, ITS ICE CREAM MUSIC 21/2 SCOOPS OUT OF FIVE. OBVIOUSLY SOME VERY TALENTED PLAYERS HERE, SOME MOMENTS OF COMPLEXITY HERE AND THERE, BUT THE MATERIAL IS POOPY. FOR MY PERSONAL TATSE, THIS WOULD GET A BIG FAT LONELY STAR, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY BAD MUSIC, I JUST COULD NOT GET IT. THE PRODUCTION IS TYPICAL OF EARLY 90'S, WAY OVERDONE, SHINY, ARTIFICIAL, THERE'S NO PROPER SPACIAL IMAGERY AT ALL. CAN YOU SAY COMPRESSION? YUCK. NOT THE GREASY, SWEATY FUNK FROM THE 70'S. MADE ME THINK OF BEING IN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR AT TIMES. WERE THESE TRACKS LEFTOVERS FROM BAD 1989-90 SESSIONS OR WHAT
0	No comment! Oops I almost forgot the song by Tom Jones called &quot;Thunderball&quot; is on here. What I meant to say was about his tunes were &quot;Kiss&quot; &amp; &quot;Puppet Man&quot; that's all
1	Coltrane at his most powerful Although "A Love Supreme" is generally regarded as Coltrane's most emotional album, "Sun Ship" tops it in intensity and passion. The music is volatile, from lush McCoy Tyner passages and Coltrane themes, to Elvin Jones's furious percussion and Coltrane's atonal improvisation. Coltrane's solos on the title track and "Amen" are guaranteed to give you goosebumps, if you "get" his later stuff
1	One of the few greatest hits albums that actually satisfy When it comes to "best of's" and compilations, very rarely can a collection successfully comprise a solid overview of a band's catalog. The Smashing Pumpkins' "Greatest Hits" is one of the few of these collections that actually satisfies, providing a very solid overview of the songs that propelled the band to stardom. Singles from "Gish" to "Machina: The Machines of God" are covered here, as well as "Eye" from the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, and unreleased songs "Real Love" and "Untitled", which are actually pretty good as well. The only real downsides to this compilation are that no other non-singles are covered here, and the CD booklet features no kind of commentary at all from any of the band members. That aside, for casual fans of the Smashing Pumpkins, "Greatest Hits" isn't a bad pick up at all
1	All you have to do is dream... For all the fans of the original Broadway musical soundtrack of "Dreamgirls," their dreams have come true with this 25th-year anniversary special edition cd. Included are all the original tracks from the Dreamgirls soundtrack and three previously unreleased recordings of "Driving Down the Strip" "It's All Over" and a reprise of the title track "Dreamgirls" for the finale. A second cd has instrumental versions of some of the stand out tracks including "And I am Telling You I'm Not Going" and "One Night Only." The album has been remastered and it does sound louder with more bass than the original, but there are some instances where Jennifer Holliday's voice begins to blare. That's probably due to the fact that Holliday is such a powerful singer and the decibel levels went into the red when they were recording the original master tapes, so it can't be helped. However, the added tracks sound very crisp and clear. Also included in this special edition cd is a booklet containing an intro by Henry Krieger(song writer for additional music in the motion picture Dreamgirls), the original liner notes with photos from the stage production, and lyrics to all the songs. I would have given this set five stars but the song "Heavy" isn't on here, neither is the disco version of "One Night Only." From what I understand, we're lucky to get the three previously unreleased tracks! Legend has it that Geffen did not want to produce a double length album with three virtually unknown singers, which explains the omission of some songs and the remixing of two different versions of "One Night Only" down to one track. Also, he wanted the best possible sound quality for the original album. The inlcusion of "It's All Over" is well worth the price of this cd. The climactic show-down between the three girls, the replacement, and the boss brings a new perspective to the show stopping song "And I'm Telling You..." One more thing, there seems to be some confusion between this cd and the one coming out for the motion picture "Dreamgirls." This is the ORIGINAL BROADWAY RECORDING of the musical. Beyonce and Jenifer Hudson are not on this cd. But Jennifer Holliday, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Loretta Devine shine as the original DREAMS
1	Excellent Wonderful Group!!!!! Great all-time favorites on this CD. Highly recommend this CD to al
0	Dissapointed I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd. All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug. This cd only has the remixes. So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead
0	I guess one would call this Soft Cheese. With the exception of a few of their more recent live albums, I have just about everything SCI has put out. I became a fan only relatively recently, but once I got one (starting with their collaboration with Kellar Williams), I got hooked and can't stop. But this album left me disappointed. It was slow and stripped down. As several have said before me, none of the jams, none of the joy, none of the humor, nor the can't-stop-moving musicality of basically every other release by these guys, whether live or in the studio. Everything else - ANYthing else- they've done is just better. Buy if you want to have a complete collection of their work, but if you're a first-time buyer, don't go here, because it's not representative of just how fantastic they are. Had this been the first album I got from them, I would not have bought more and would've missed the unbelievable experience I have every time I listen to virtually everything else they've done.
0	Big mistake / lost opportunity The point has come that nearly all great recordings have been remastered in some way, shape or form and subsequently re-released. Because of that I decided to get an iPod strictly for the purpose of "collecting" as many of my favorites as possible. My plan has been to buy most of them from Amazon or an Amazon seller & then put them on the pod. So much of my favorite music has been re-mastered (makes me feel old.. maybe cuz I am!) that this has become quite a project! Anyway, almost every re-mastered CD I've picked up has sounded better than the original. Some are improved so much that it's as if the album seems like a brand new release (PSBWB is a phenomenal example). Anyhow, I didn't realize that CTE was remastered AND remixed when I bought it. I expected it to be like all the other remasters I've listened to - a favorite album with much better clarity and a lot more boom. Countdown to Extinction is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned, even though my favorite Megadeath album is probably Peace Sells. Countdown was (when first released) absolutely perfect - something no other Megadeath album had been. Dave had recently gotten sober if I recall corectly, and that along with the new guys made this a new sound with much more maturity than before. It was landmark to be sure. Did I mention it was perect? The reMIX was a horrible mistake in my book. If Dave wanted a remix for himself & burned it during the remaster work that would have been fine - but to release the so-called "Remastered" CTE in a completely different form SUCKS - I feel ripped off. I want the opportunity to own CTE in REMASTERED form without anything other than the quality of sound being tweaked. Maybe if enough people complain and continue to do so the nagging will eventually lead to such a release. Dave should be aware that potential NEW Megadeath fans were won over by the thousands with this album, and it probably continues to do so - but if the average CD of CTE floating around on the net or on store shelves 5 years from now is the remaster (and thus ALSO reMIXed), it will likely not win the new listener over. That's sad, because CTE is Megadeath's "Black" album - and the remix is a completely different album with completely different songs. It is not a remix or a remaster, it's a new release. Had this remixed version been what was released when CTE originally came out, it wouldn't be worth issuing as a remaster in the first place. I WANT MY CTE REMASTER!!!!
1	They don't come like this anymore Sometimes you just want to be transported to a different musical universe,to a time when everything was possible.From the outrageous clothes of Alphonse on the cover(why are we so boring these days?)to the fantastic tight energetic playing of everyone involved, this is a CD that holds up remarkably well.The sound quality on my CD is amazing, and if you think jazz fusion means unstructured noodling then you couldn't be further from the truth with this disc.The songs are focused and precise with accessible melodies and inspired solos.There is a real sort of joy that emanates from this music thats very refreshing in our crazy 21st century world
0	EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS UNRELEASED TAPES I WANT TO KNOW WHY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, TENDER YEARS WAS ON THIS ALBUM AND WHY IT'S NOT THERE NOW. WITHOUT TENDER YEARS, THIS ALBUM ISN'T WORTH .2/ BELIEVE ME, MY COMPANY WON'T EVEN SPONSOR THE DEEID AND THE CRUISERS ALBUMS ANYMORE
1	Perfect. I bought 'On Land' this afternoon and have been playing it constantly -- it's been round about six or seven times already. The first time, it sounded utterly familiar, like music I'd heard a long time ago and forgotten. Every time since, it sounds different and new. I already had 'Music for Airports' and 'Plateaux of Mirror' (with Harold Budd), but 'On Land' has convinced me that Eno is, without exaggeration or qualification, a great artist. Even his liner notes are intelligent without being pretentious, a rare achievement for a musician! Although very superficially similar, it doesn't take long to realize that Eno's ambient works are a world away from the lazy, sonically unadventurous tinklings of countless 'New Age' pieces (many of which were probably inspired by Eno, unfortunately). In 'On Land' every sound is meticulously placed, every treatment thoughtful and, needless to say, beautifully produced. Moving away from the idea of 'performable' music towards pure studio recordings allows a degree of control -- crucially, control of tonal contour and spatial organisation -- that makes these tracks more like aural sculptures than music. That's probably why they sound so different on different systems, in different rooms, at different angles from the sound source etc. If that makes it sound like an academic exercise, be aware that this is also a very emotional record -- although the emotions communicated are usually obscure, ineffable, almost impalpable. Whereas some of Eno's other ambient works are explicitly NOT to be listened to directly, I can't help feeling that 'On Land' demands more focused attention. It will certainly repay; after just a few hours, it already feels like one of my favourite records
1	You're My Sickness Diva Destruction is another band that I just had to check out without having to listening to their music. I was intrigued by what I have read about them on Metropolis Record's website. It also helped that they are signed to my favorite record label so I had some inkling to what the band sounded like...somewhat. I bought the cd last Thursday and since then I have been listening to the cd non-stop... The in your face production from Scott Humphrey and Frank Gryner knocked me off my feet. I haven't heard such clean production as what I just heard on "Exposing the Sickness". Debra Fogarty's vocals (w/back up vocals from Sharon Blackstone) reminded me a lot of Siouxsie Sioux and Tina and Susan from Switchblade Symphony. Very powerful. Debra could put a lot of today's singers to shame. The bass, drums, guitars, and programming blended well, a mixture of rock and industrial music. As I am listening to "Exposing the Sickness" again, Diva Destruction reminds me a lot like their fellow labelmates Clan of Xymox and Bella Morte but with female lead singer, especially Bella Morte but with more programming and less guitars. I loved "Exposing the Sickness" right from the get go with the first track "Heathcliff". My favorite songs off this album has to be the remix to "When Trees Would Dance" (as well as the original version), "Tempter", "Valley of the Scars", and "Hypocrite". I definitely plan on acquiring their first album as well as future releases from the band in the near future
0	Unauthorized release This release contains a track by the Egyptian-born U.S. composer Halim El-Dabh which was used without his permission or consent, and for which he is obtaining no royalties. Please take this into consideration when choosing whether to purchase this recording
0	As Many IQ Points as notes There is nothing remotely heavy and/or musical about this band. Every song uses the same three powerchords, the same drum lines, the same taking-a-dump vocal histrionics, the same lyrics of no substance and one subject. Do yourselves a favor and find something actually artistically worthy of the intelligent mind, and don't be fooled into thinking that this is heavy in any non-primitive way
0	Parallel Universe? People who listen to the Goldberg Variations on piano must live in a parallel universe. Liquid legato? Three minutes of passion? There is no other set of variations of any era for any instrument more "structurally" conceived and unified than the Goldbergs! It's all or nothing, not a string of pearls. Please, please, listen to the harpsichord performances of Trevor Pinnock or Bob van Asperen before you spend money on another pianist's misconception. Ms Tureck's performance, by the way, is particularly inchoate. If you must have piano, try Richard Goode
0	Wake me when it's over I agree with the previous reviewer: this recording contains about three minutes of musical bliss. The rest of it is self-conscious and belabored
1	excellent album if simply for Kathryn Williams' "Buzzin' Fly" and Stephen Fretwell's rendition of "Morning Theft," this album is worth getting... all the songs are genuinely new takes on these two amazing musicians... highly recommende
1	Time to show my age Saw this group TWICE on this album tour. EXCELLENT. Wore the album out. Have the CD, a must have for true southern rockers
0	Disappointed OK, I'm down with funk, and I've been down with the resergence in fusion/bugaloo/funk/jazz like MMW, Greyboy, Galactic. But I'm sorry, the turkish instruments just do not work here. Try imagining James Brown with an Irish jig band playing along. Get my point? They just don't mix. Don't get me wrong, I'm down with BFE. But did they have to throw the turks into every jam? The mix was just too caustic
1	Chet is Therapy The perfect album for after work; this music really compliments that first wonderful moment when you kick off your shoes, ease your chair back...and relax with a cocktail after a hard day. Chet is my relaxation hero
0	SORRY MARC...JUST DO YOUR THING. I have to say something about this Cd...I mean,I know Marc Anthony tried to do something different this time and he did it,but pop is not his thing..."MENDED" is a weak album,with 2 or 3 good songs as "Love Won't get any better" "She mends me" and maybe even "Tragedy" that's all. I used to be a fan of Marc Anthony's Salsa albums...but this is actually pop from hell. Sorry Marc...Just do your thing
1	the only GOOD rap band! wicked album guys. Got a pre release version of this with a blue cover and DVD and errors on the track listing due to the time limit of a couple of songs. Nelly Furtado guest stars on one of the songs! This is an awesome old school politically orientated rap band who care for our planet. Theve got a new album coming out soon as well. So i guess "Stay Tuned
0	I love Brian setzer's Orch., but... Setzer and his band are sizzlin' hot, and he is my favorite swing band leader, however no matter how many times I try to listen to this cd, I just can't bring myself to like it. It is just too darn hokey, cheezy, commercial, and corny. In the Mood is full of energy, and could have been great without the "DJ MIX" club beat intro, and I find the rapping offensive racially. It sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere, and mocking the race. Setzer's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great, and band is smokin. The sonsg americano sucks, and the production value in nill, zero, nana, it's WAY overproduced. Buy hsi new live 2 cd set instead..
1	One Of The Greatest Albums Ever Made Set the twilgiht reeling truely has every musical element. Lou Reed showcases his ability to produce beautiful meaningful and passionate songs and at the same time also keep a comedic tone. Riptide alone reaches deep down inside you and touches your heart and Soul. Only New York, Berlin and Transformer Almost match this level of quality. Hooky Wooky, Trade In, Adventurer, Finish line, the title track, and Hang onto your emotions are all fantastic. With Great Lyrics, Well Written songs and Unsermountalbe passion, Set The Twilight Reeling truely is one of the greatest albums ever made
1	sexy, calming, energizing! This is not &quot;smooth jazz&quot; in the nauseating sense made famous by certain clarinet players. This rocks. Groovin' baseline, hot licks, great variety of rhythm. This CD is my preferred favorite, many nights running, after fighting L.A. traffic all the way home. Sexy, calming, energizing, -- if someone could bottle what this CD does for me they would make a mint! (You gotta try it!
1	Debut of the most overlooked rock group ever (5 Stars) Supergrass' I Should Coco is a landmark acheivement. The thought that mere teenagers could recreate an energy not felt since the birth of punk in the late 70s is astounding. Supergrass deliver great track after great track almost through the entire album, each one filled with a youthful energy and an appropriate goofiness that is so lacking in the world of music. The frontman of the band, Gaz Coombs, has written enough infectious songs on this one effort alone to qualify him as one of the great pop writers of all time. Only during maybe one or two tracks does the album slow a bit. It effects the final result of the album but it doesn't kill it (the slow tracks are just as good as the rest). It's amazing to think how short-lived Supergrass' fame was when listening to this fine album and one can only hope that these unsung artists will rise to the top once more
0	THIS IS NOT THE RYODISC RADIO ONE LIVE SESSIONS these are pre-canned radio shows with the ever unbearable alexis korner talking on top of the songs as wow cool groovy DJ "intro". the old Radio One was a real live in studio show that was GREAT. THese are mostly studio released cuts from the first and second album mixed with DJ chatter and one HEndrix interview with a phoney, well let's hear that song now shall we intro to the recorded album version! As one who has been seriously burned by repackaged Hendrix stuff in the past, and as a loong time fan (I remember when he lived and died) it takes alot for me NOT to recommend all things Hendrix, but I cannot recommend this. Find the actual LIVE RAdio One recording, not these packaged cut and pasted radio shows
1	I couldn't be happier! The product was exaclty what I asked for. Chock full of Queen hits that should satisfy any queen fan
1	... and 1/2 ....strong rhythmic intensity, catchy lyrics & just plain ol' fun rowdiness Playing Time - 38:26 -- If you know what's best for you on a Saturday night, then you'll pick up a copy of "Horseshoes & Hand Grenades," for a driving set of Summar's rockin' country music. Actually, he calls it "farm rock," a convergence of Chuck Berry and George Jones. Full of grit, Trent incorporates strong rhythmic intensity as the foundation for his striking stories and just plain ol' fun rowdiness. The elements all lend perfectly to our listening amusement. They hit the ground with a steady gallop from the first song to the last, even with the brief eccentric punk/grunge moments in "He Stopped Loving Her Today" that will either get you frowning or smiling depending on how open-minded you are to the boys having a little fun with the country classic. I haven't heard the album that Trent put out in 2000 (or his 1994 "Hank Flamingo" release), but understand that it brought plenty of airplay, gig and tour offers...even landed him a showcase on the Grand Ole Opry. Produced by Rand Bishop, "Horseshoes & Hand Grenades" further indulges us with some eclectic alt-country instrumentalists and background vocalists. Remember the Ozark Mountain Daredevils with their blend of country rock, bluegrass, and southern boogie? Bassman/vocalist Michael "Supe" Granda was a founding member of that group. And the 1980s Atlanta-based Georgia Satellites with their Stones-like guitar grunge? Guitarist/vocalist Dan Baird was a key member of that enjoyable band. Steel guitarist Gary Morse is a regular with Brooks & Dunn. Other experienced musicians in The New Row Mob include Dave Kennedy (drums), Ken McMahan (guitar), and a host of others who appear to a lesser degree on the CD. Mike Webb's piano and B-3 organ are noteworthy. Besides those collaborations with other Nashville-based writers, a number of the musicians on the album co-wrote many of these songs with Summar. And you may have already heard some of the songs covered by others like Billy Currington ("She Knows What to Do With a Saturday Night"), Gary Allan ("Guys Like Me"), and Jack Ingram ("Love You"). That's a feather is Summar's cap for other up-and-coming singers to acknowledge the sturdiness of Trent's material. Without being too disparaging, I found the similarity of the beat in a few of the songs to create a modicum of banality. But, for the most part, the set progresses as a successful, raucous journey from beginning to end. Reminiscent of the Bakersfield sound, the country rock-infused groove and clever lines convey some deliriously fun messages. Some other catchy hooks, and even some rustic bluegrass flavorings, are found in songs like "Hayride," "Pink John Deere," and "Girl From Tennessee." Hitting you like an express train, "Louisiana Nashville Line" is full of steam. In "Guys Like Me," Trent sings "It's hard to find a place to play my guitar, they're trying to put an end to guys like me." I'd say this album will fetch him plenty of fame and gigs. Trent's well on his way to landing his golden dreams on solid ground. (Joe Ross, Roseburg, OR.)
1	Five Stars does not do this art justice. From where Metheny and his group members, (of a common soul, I'd almost swear, playing different tools from the same heart with different fingers) take me and took European audiences on this album, I would have titled it "Levitation." Music, well composed and performed, built and played with care, love, creativity and talent, takes me places that approach ecstatic. With this work on the audiograph I am transported places VERY few other musicians have ever taken me close to, in any genre. I can only compare it to feeling lifted up and floating, being held aloft--levitated-- by Pat's group, working together so tightly while flowing, like liquid, over and through the songs' melodies, arrangements, rhythms. Listening, right now, to this CD's version of the Metheny-Mays standard "First Circle." Am in the clouds! Think it's just my opinion? Listen to the crowd! Damn! Those big, blocky Mays chords. Buy the album. Put it in a car's player. Turn it up!!! You will thank me. You will thank those 6 guys. You won't want to get where you're going. Le
1	stirring and hauntingly beautiful Those of you who aren't familiar with Ofra Haza, I encourage you to please listen to this beautiful woman's albums. "Kirya" is definitely a wonderful example of the legacy Haza left, when she passed away in 2000. Although some call her the "Madonna of the Middle East," in my opinion I think she is far more talented, prolific and outstanding. For starters, Ofra Haza was devoutly religious, as a Yemenite Jew, from Israel, had a clean sound, put ancient poetry to music, and used her voice as an instrument for peace and liberation. That is where she and Madonna vear off quite differently from one another. "Kirya" presents a beautiful cross-section of songs and experiences. We hear her sing in English, Arameic and Hebrew. The songs are about sadness, mortality and love. Some great, outstanding examples on this album include: "Trains of No Return" (about the effects of the Holocaust and the trains heading to Auschwitz and Dachau, amongst many other concentration camps, where Jews were systematically executed), "Daw da Hiya," (about the consequences of a young woman's premarital affair with her lover), and "Don't Forsake Me" (about old age). This is a treasure of an album. Buy it today.....Let the legacy of Ofra Haza remain for many, many years to come. What an inspirational and beautiful woman......
0	Comin' With a 2.5! Keith Sweat's 1991 release didn't come off as the usual or other releases of his. For starters, Keith is mostly known for his bumping slow jams and he didn't let us down with the ones on here. As a matter of fact, that was the only thing that kept this one from being a total disaster. Once getting to track 6 with "I Want To Love You Down" the lp quickly prepares you for the whining and begging that makes him so popular. It couldn't have got any better with "Give Me What I Want" featuring Silk on background and taking the song to the next level of sexiness. Silk and Mr. Sweat invites you with "The Ten Commandments Of Love" with the background vocals saying, "...come on, come on, come on, come on baby...". Maybe this release would have been better if it was an entire Keith Sweat & Silk release
1	More than solid sophomore album One of the most ecxiting new bands to come out of Cincinnati in recent years is the Heartless [...] (urrgh, what a TERRIBLE band name), a power trio led by singer-songwriter-guitarist Erila Wennerstrom. 18 months after the release of their very promising debut album "Stairs and Elevators" now comes the second album. "ALl This Time" (10 tracks, 40 min.) finds a more polished, but still very hard rocking, sound. The album's first track "Into the Open" starts off with a piano even. Wennerstrom continues to provide layers of guitar riffs, and the rest of the band contributes to the "wall of sound". Guitar solos are far and few between (only on the title track and on the closer "Comes a Long Way"). The album really takes flight on the second half, with highlight after highlight: "Blue Day" and "No Pointing Arrows" are the proof that this band has "it". In all, a very satisfying album that zooms by in no time, and you'll want to play it again. I've seen the band live a couple of times in the last 10 days, giving shows around town in preparation for a long nation-wide tour to support "All This Time". Frankly, the band is even better live than in the studio, and they are not to be missed if you have chance to see them. Highly recommended
1	Awesome...it doesn't get much better than this Live and incredible sound of Bill Champlin's voice with veteran musicians just sizzling along. This is a CD not to miss. Wow. Why don't we have more music like this today
1	Breathe deep - this "smoke" is good for the soul Lucky Thompson was a strange one - a fighter, a questioner, a perfectionist, a complainer, a self-proclaimed victim of musical exploitation by what he called "vultures" - who dropped from the scene sometime in the mid-late 70s, gave his horns away to pay off debts, and never had anything to do with music again. He died a homeless recluse in Seattle in July 2005. Oh yeah, he was also one of the greatest tenor saxophonists ever to play jazz. This 1964 quartet date finds Lucky in the company of a very supportive rhythm section. The lyrical and fleet Hank Jones on piano is a handsome foil for the equally fleet and lyrical Thompson. On half the tunes Lucky plays soprano; MID-NITE OIL and PREY LOOT, both Lucky compositions, are good soprano tracks. Lucky's writing has always been attractive. On tenor, FLY WITH THE WIND and REMINISCENT, again tunes written by Thompson, are the highlights. Connie Kay's drumming, so light and tasty, is a treat throughout the proceedings. This album is definitely worth checking out
1	This music will make you fall in love with New York I have listened to this soundtrack hundreds of times since the movie came out and it brings back floods of memories of when I lived in New York City. A wonderful score,wonderful arrangements. S'wonderfull all the way around..

1	The Best Live Album Ever Made... Between 1971 and 1976, Roxy Music were in their "hip" phase and they were one of the best live acts ever, and still are today (can't wait for their new album!) I was not around for their 70s touring (*or for that matter, their Manifesto-Avalon tours, I was born in 1991). Here is what I say about Roxy Music: MOVE OVER PINK FLOYD! OUT OF MY WAY LED ZEPPELIN! THE WHO, THIS ISN'T A PARKING LOT! Roxy Music were the best band in all of the world and will always retain that position, with three frontmen: Bryan Ferry- The best singer in rock history and the best looking Andy Mackay- His saxophone playing will blow you away Phil Manzanera- His guitar playing is world-class And to top it all off, you have THE GREAT Paul Thompson, the most energetic drummer ever! His drumming is not one little bit out-of-time. And of course, there's the magnificent Brian Eno + Eddie Jobson who were the group's synthesiser players from 1971-73 and 1973-76 respectively. Jobson also played violin, which just added another coolness point. These guys ARE THE ONLY BAND THAT MATTERS! AND THEY DIDN'T SELL OUT BUT STILL KNEW WHAT TOP OF THE POPS WAS! Only drawback to the album: Not enough songs! NO THREE + NINE! NO MOTHER OF PEARL! AND NO LOVE IS THE DRUG! Otherwise, I give this 6 STARS PS To everyone who says the Clash were the only band that mattered, you guys suck
1	Still writing great music Upon first listening to 'Fundamental' I wasn't too impressed. Nothing really grabbed me. It all sounded like typical Pet Shop Boys. But as I listened more, the songs began to take a life all their own. 'the sodom and gomorrah show' and 'numb' were the two that stuck out. 'sodom and gomorrah show', with it's driving beat and catchy melody and 'numb' and it's emotional plea to 'feel nothing' were both examples of fantastic harmony between lyric and melody. the group has survived for more than 20 years in an era that no longer embraces their brand of pop without compromising their message or their sound. I'm grateful to have had privilege of going to one of their shows recently. Mainly because they're still touring, but also because they retain every bit of what made them famous in the 80s with a little song called 'west end girls'
0	The Most Romantic Melodies of All Time... ...become the most irritating elevator pablum ever concieved. Perfect for Stepfords everywhere! Not music, but a powerful central nervous system depressant that may cause permanent organic brain damage! Not Music! Avoid
1	well... I would just like to take this opportunity to point out that the previous reviewer is mistakenly talking about From Her to Eternity, Cave's first album. The Firstborn is Dead is quite good, though, even if nothing else on it quite matches the greatness of Tupelo
0	Pleeze, Pleeze, Pleeze I don't know what happened but this album needs to be slept on. This dude keeps rappin' about where he's from and junk like that. It's like he doesn't have anything else to say. While the production may be okay (it's questionable)the lyrics just plain suck. Hey Fiend give Dr. Dre a call
1	His BEST This has to be his best CD. Not to long, not too short, unbelieveably funny! The comedian is live, uncensored, at his raunchy best. We miss you, Sam. RIP
1	UB40 at their best I first bought this album in the early 80s and I played it to death. I've been very dissappointed with later UB40 albums. To my mind this album is how UB40 should sound. I still experience a thrill every time I hear the beginning to "Present arms". "Sardonicus" just cooks, great intro and just it bubbles alongs. At a matter of fact, all the songs (with the exception of Love Is All Is Alright & Don't Slow Down , which is are bit limp) on this album are very good. If you like trippy sounding ska with a slight dub flavour, I'm confident that you will like this album
1	Strictly Old School There are approximately four songs, that were released during my high school years. " Love On A Two-Way Street", is the song that triggers the memories, of a time in my life, when songs of love, especially young love, meant something! Raymond Oakley-St. Louis, Mo.
0	Misinterpretations! I was shocked to see that Maurice White had a hand in this misinterpretations of Earth Wind and Fire's classic songs. This CD was to launch or re-launch the Stax label. Its too bad the label did not launch with more orginal artists and compositions. While you may like the arrangements of the Elements' compositions, I could not get through this effort. The originals suit me just fine.
0	Oh for god sake While I am a Blur fan I just cannot listen to this drivel. It's picked up this cult status among Blur fans as it's the heart-rendering story of Damon Albarn's break up with then girlfriend and lead singer of Wire rip-offs Elastica, Justine Frischmann. 13 is a document of that break up and my god it's useless self indulgence. Mindless even. First we'll start off with the singles. Tender - a plodding gospel song that goes nowhere and proves that Damon just can't hack it when it comes to soul no matter how much he protests. Long winded and uninteresting Coffee & TV - While I marvel at the video, I do think that that takes away from the fact that this song is very ordinary and nothing at all special. It does feature one of Graham Coxon's more agreeable vocals and goes by fine enough. No Distance Left To Run - Awful. Just plain awful. It never deserved to be a single. It should never have been a single. The lyrics are the most embarrassing I have ever listened to and Damon's voice is just off beyond all point. Although I'm sure those who love this album will point out that it's supposed to represent the pain he's going through. It just doesn't work. As for the rest of the album it just a horrible mess of styles thrown together to make it sound like they've been listening to the coolest albums around and that America's underground is really cool which is ironic given that this band originally wanted to go against all that. People say that Blur is Graham's album and this is 13's album and while I'm not so sure I'd label Blur Graham's album I can definitely agree with 13 being Damon's album. It's completely self-absorbed and the music is secondary to the theme of the album which in my book is never a good thing. However there are a couple of good songs. BLUREMI and 1992 are toetappers and the often underrated Optigan 1. Poor Optigan 1. The Optigan is one of the more fascinating instruments and has a gently surreal yet antique way of sound. It's a credit that this was made. Yet it goes almost unnoticed by many because " Oh it's just an instrumental." A shame that, because it sounds like everything this album is trying to be; emotional, warm, hurt. But most of the tracks here are surrounded in half thought-out ideas, lazily produced songs and in the case of Trimm Trabb, nicking the opening riff of Wined and Dined by Syd Barrett. I once said that this album was a poor man's Bad Moon Rising ( by Sonic Youth ) and by god I stick to that statement. While that album had oozing soundscapes, inventive lyrics and a sense of adventure even in dealing with some similar viewpoints ( although not all )......this feels completely lazy, lyrics depressed 15 year olds would laugh at, music that doesn't really do much and not a lot much else. It's painful to say that this is the same band who an album beforehand made something that was a stroke of genius. This however is not the answer though. Buy this if you are in love with Damon's ego. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and buy other Blur albums ( other than The Great Escape and Leisure ) or better yet buy Sonic Youth's Bad Moon Rising. Beats the hell out of this cra
1	On my top 10 This is one of my favorite records. By FAR the best Blur record if you're trying to decide which one to get
0	Not an easy listen I have found that there are two types of R &amp; H works. There are the lively and upbeat scores, like Cinderella and Sound of Music. Then there are the slower and denser scores, like Carousel and the King and I, which are not bad, but not to my liking. There are not many songs on here that appeal to the popular tastes. Music theorists will probably love it. I have found that the best R and H works are the ones that sound like they were written today, most notably Sound of Music
0	Sepultura's worst attempt. This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I got this album for my birthday as I was and still am a keen listener of metal and heavy metal music. I have albums of Metallica,Queens of the Stone Age, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Korn, Slipknot and Disturbed that I like, but Sepultura's Against is a joke. The first track seems promissing with some cool guitar riffs and a solid heavy rythm. Afterwards, it just goes downhill. Every song seemed to mimic the next, with its repetative guitar solos and awful vocals from Derrick 'The D!*$' Green. Sepultura were a much better band with Max Cavalera and now the lead singer sounds like he has no teeth. All of my friends (who are metal heads) agree with me 100% that this is Sepultura's WORST album. Totally dreadful. After 10 minutes of flicking through each song, I had to stop it, take it out and throw it out the window. My advice: AVOID
0	Not even for Gertrude Lawrence fans! This CD is shamefully misleading! It only features snipets of the original score and two members of the original cast. In fact, there is more dialogue than music on this CD! Worse, it sound like somebody dug up a set of '78s they found buried at the bottom of their gandfather's trunk and decided to record them on CD, scratches, pops, and all! I am a huge fan of Gertie Lawrence, but even I didn't have the nerve to play this CD more than once! Pick up The Royal National Theatre's production instead
0	Love Willie, hate this The producer of this record does not kow reggae. Buy Willie's other records, but skip this. Buy any Marley record instead. The stiff, uneasy rhythm section on this album wouldn't have made it as fifth stand-in for any proper reggae artist
0	too many re-recordings for my taste That's right, this is a collection of mostly the 60's countrypolitan stereo remakes of the 1950's classics with a sprinkling of originals from the 1960's but the re-recordings are definitely enough to let you all know that this CD is not recommended and that I recommend the Legacy &quot;Look What Thoughts Will Do&quot; 2 CD set with only the originals. It may be a little higher priced but it delivers what it promises, the originals. The disc is rated 1 star for the heavy amount of re-recordings (many awful performances) and another star for the sprinkling of originals
1	This is the G $h%t Ya'll need dis CD. This fool str8 flows. RIP lil homey Trubl loc E
1	not so bad at all Hypnotic, dreamy but not as laid back as the 12th installment... but the series is more mature these days on applying more on the acoustic side rather than the electronic effect
0	fairly average I will Always give Shelia E.madd props for Her Musical Talent but this Album doesn't do it for me all the way.soft vibe&missing some snap.there are hints of Funk here&there but overall nothing really cooks to me.She does Her Best Work overall for Others&Live to me.but this is another mild Album which hardly to me showcases Her full Musicial depth
1	Flawed gem. This album is a bit of an enigma to me, the material stands up, really well, but there's definitely weaknesses throughout it as well. Let's start with the good-- certainly, the songs are brilliant-- "Love and Mercy" and "Melt Away", both really great sentimental pieces (the latter in particular is a personal favorite), "There's So Many" and "Let It Shine" both feature great vocal arrangements, and "Rio Grande" is just magnficiant. And certainly many of the others ("Walkin' the Line", "Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight") are more than good enough. But there are some flaws-- Brian's voice sounds odd to me, I can't place it, almost forced, and his falsetto is definitely limited, probably most obvious on "One For the Boys" and "There's So Many". Beyond this though, the biggest problem with the album is the '80s production, too many synthesizers, some of the songs would (and did in recent live performances) benefit from more acoutic arrangements. Overall however, the album is rewarding, and you sort of get used to its odd sound. The bonus tracks on the reissue are so-so, my favorite is actually the track titled "Brian on 'Love and Mercy'", which also features a snippet of a piano-and-vocal demo of the song. The b-sides are kind of blah, but the demos are all really interesting
0	Teenager was brilliant Just because you start doing Neil Young inspired music doesn't make it mature or creative. I too miss Speedy Marie. Maybe I'm just old
1	Worthy sequel to their 1977 classic Although I prefer the original Ocean from 1977, this 1998 sequel isn't bad at all. Of course if you're a fan of the original Ocean like I am, don't expect it to sound like a clone of the original, you might be disappointed. I had my suspicions when I bought this disc, as I'm sure many others had, after all, there are so many prog bands out there that rightfully remained silent in the 1980s, only to reunite in the 1990s and give us some truly embarassing, pale, or uninspired stuff in an attempt to recapture their past glory. I'm glad Eloy didn't fall in to that trap. The production and sound of Ocean 2 is modern, digitally recorded. Definately not recommended to those prog rock fans who are anti-modern and like everything analog. But even so, the biggest surprise is the use of analog synths here! I hear my share Minimoog, some string synths, and even a little clavinet. Digital synths are also used, but hardly ever detracts from the music. By this time, Eloy was back to being a full band, thanks to Frank Bornemann, old-time member Klaus-Peter Matziol, Bornemann's late '80s/early '90s partner Michael Gerlach, and ex-Michael Schenker Group drummer Bodo Schopf. The reason I took a star off was I thought the end part of the CD dragged on a little (particularly &quot;The Answer&quot;), but eventually that no longer bothered me. Apparently, Eloy's previous label, SPV, rejected Ocean 2, so they moved on to a totally unlikely label: GUN (Great Unlimited Noise) whose specialty seems to be speed/thrash/death metal, so having a prog band on that label is truly strange company. So never mind the label Eloy was recording for this disc, if you're a prog rock fan, and you don't mind a more modern twist in your music, and you like vintage synths, you're sure to love this one
1	About Time!! Love .45 has been working so hard for over 10 years and finally the fruits of their labor is coming to bear. Their sound has remained very consistant over the years with every release getting better and better. Now, these 12 songs, are so representative of the energy, enthusiasm and great heart, it's hard not to rank them among the elite. This CD will prove once and for all, that all those years of struggle were worth every minute. Don't miss out on getting in on the ground floor with this band. They will be successful for years to come!
0	Junk "My Chain" is the worst song I have heard in a few years ... Go get Nas "Hip Hop Is Dead" instead of this garbage.
0	What the...? This deal was the biggest rip off! What DID indeed happen to the extra videos promised on the back? Victory, just keep reaping that bad press..
1	Classics Revisited and Given New Life (4.5 stars) This album, technically, is not new. Having been recorded over five years ago and released only in Japan, Scaggs chooses to revisit a number of his classic tunes -an unplugged "Lowdown," "Sierra," "Harbor Lights" and an glorious " We're All Alone"among others- and record them again under a moodier, at times even bluesier, light. Think of some place between "But Beautiful" and a more acoustic "Desire," if you are comparing albums. The core band, as well as the string arrangements, are tuned in to Scaggs' intent and contribute a great backdrop for his voice, which sounds quite great throughout these versions, the best example being the new take on "Simone." So, this is not quite a new album, we know the songs and it comes out after a long and inexplicable domestic delay, but the music contained here is pure Boz, sometimes at his best
1	The best Final Fantasy music for one of the best games ever. I very rarely buy a soundtrack, especially to a videogame, however this one left me with no choice but to do so. This easily the best videogame music I have ever listened to. I guess one reason behind me buying this is the fact that unlike many PSX games, this one you can not listen to as a backwards compatible CD (All the final fantasies are this way) and the poor music CD that came with Anthologies left me wanting more. No this is well worht purchasing even if you don't like the game, the music is more than enough to make this worth owning
1	Short and sweet Excellent selection of some of the best from these three friends (and a little Zach Gill, too!). Gives you the feeling you're sneaking into a weekend jam session at Jack's house. Fans of these guys will want to add this CD to their library. Seems to me, though, they could have easily added a few more songs and make this a full length effort
1	Dio Is the voice of Black Sabbath A powerful but overlooked Black Sabbath album with the definitive vocals of Ronnie James Dio. A mercilessly heavy song selection boasting excellent production, something "Mob Rules" can't say, strong songwriting and some of the best musicians on the planet. From this springboard you can see where Dio went with the release of his next solo albums. "Dehumanizer" will stand the test of time as one of the three best Sabbath albums ever alongside "Mob Rules" and "Heaven and Hell.
1	Milestone for an Exceptional but Too-Often Overlooked Artist Chely Wright is that rare artist whose voice conveys more than just melody, there's raw emotion behind the words, and a range of emotion that runs the entire gamut from ecstasy to mournful sorrow. That she earned her first number one single with the title track from this album was both blessing and curse. "Single White Female" was pure country pop, upbeat and quirky, a unique initial offering on an album that grows progressively more complex and introspective with each subsequent song. That MCA followed "Single White Female" by releasing the lyrically strong but folksy, down-tempo "She Went Out for Cigarettes" is almost inexplicable; the two songs are such polar-opposites that their back-to-back pairing on the album is somewhat jarring. There are so many solid songs on this album that it's hard to say what could have happened had the follow-up been one of her more high-energy tracks or one of her more soul-searching ballads. Thematically, Single White Female is an album about every facet of love, from the awkward beginning stages to the tearful end. The album's true center comes not from the title track, but from the third single released, "It Was". For those attracted to the album by the title track, "The Fire" comes closest to matching its energy and tone, followed by the radio-friendly "Some Kind of Somethin'". Together with "Single White Female", this trio of peppy songs anchor and invigorate an overall somber ten-track album. Perhaps the strongest track on the album is the fourth, "Unknown", a slow ballad with a wailing steel guitar accompaniment whose lyrics touch the great fears so many of us share of ending our days alone; Chely's smoky voice has never conveyed more collective pathos. There's also an updated version of her 1996 single, "The Love that We Lost"--which, vocally, is so much stronger than the radio release from her second album that the two songs sound vastly different despite nearly identical musical arrangements. Then there's "Picket Fences", a song laced with tangible irony, regret, and even denial--a trifecta that paint a vivid but sad story of a career-driven persona. The album ends with the cute but bittersweet "Rubbin' it In", a song about all those little haunting reminders that come after a relationship ends, and the desperate pining of "Why Do I Still Want You". Both lyrically and vocally, this is an album that strives to make a connection with the listener. For those so attuned, Single White Female is a too-often overlooked emotional journey that's solid and rewarding, a milestone record in a career that deserves so much more attention from an artist who has never gotten the attention she truly deserves. Closing in on a decade since the album's release, the sound and the soul are still as fresh today as they were when Single White Female first hit store shelves, longevity that's rare in an age of throw-away music from a seemingly endless parade of different but identical pre-fab singers
1	Everything's Kool! What a set! One disc of hardcore funk, and one disc of great 80s pop. Kool and the Gang's transformation is just as radical as Fleetwood Mac's was when Lindsey and Stevie joined, or when Talking Heads went from new wave to funk. Disc one brought back a lot of memories for me; songs I had completely forgotten about, "Funky Stuff", "Hollywood Swingin'", "Higher Plane", "Summer Madness", and "Love and Understanding". Allegedly the early stuff kept James Brown awake at night; the Gang was THAT funky. Proof's on disc one. The songs are mostly instrumental with a smattering of call/response. Their M.O. is simple, establish the groove and WORK IT. And then James JT Taylor joined in 1979 and, thus disc two. The Gang is now a hit machine, cranking out the music like Ford turned out Thunderbirds: "Ladies Night", "Too Hot", "Celebration" (which will live long after you and I are gone), and on and on and on. Even in this phase they still etablish the groove and work it, as displayed on the almost 7 minute "Let's Go Dancing"... even that's too short! Whoever put this together at Universal deserves a raise or something. The songs are chronological, well written band essay, ample credits. This two disc best of should be the standard to which other record companies strive. Get yours today
1	smooth and smoking Buddy Guy is THE definiition of the blues. This album is a collection of the Chess recording years and is one of those albums i can put on and let run straight through. The first song on the album &quot;Worried Mind&quot; is a great lesson in &quot;less is more&quot; guitar soloing. &quot;I found a true love is buttery smooth and &quot;leave my little girl alone&quot; is a blues classic. If your not convinced that this is a great album just remember that Stevie Ray Vaughn and Eric Clapton considered Buddy one of their biggest influences
1	Love it I love this CD - whenever I want to relax, meditate, or even get work done and hopefully avoid stress, I put this CD on and it is just soothing!
0	For diehards only. Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little. Second, I really don't care for "The Hand That Feeds". Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work. The remix fares no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious. If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S
1	wired rules! This is my fav for guitar instrumentals.What I love about beck is that he is about tone and not about speed.most people think the faster your solos are the better,not true at all.beck has amazing melody and tone and is very technical and his leads and solos are amazing.a great album by my favorite guitarist. Beck is very underated.he can play as good as any of the greats.he buries clapton,page.i would say hendrix and beck are the 2 best guitar players.both have great tone and similar styles
0	Cruel Brittania Britain, circa 1997. Tony Blair is elected P.M. Princess Di perishes. And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public. This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing. To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is. Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor. The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles. Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze. I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night". Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught. Oh, well. On to "From Justin to Kelly"
1	Lunar Powered I'm only familiar w/ the soundtrack from the movie video so far but plan to get the CD. The soundtrack, especially the melodic, casual and deliberate &quot;Bright Moon,&quot; combined with the camera-work and choreography really did it for me. I got used to the higher pitch that the singer used almost immediately. This would make a great CD for the highway
0	Not at all what I expected Junque music. Sorry I bought it. There are two songs off of the Raising Arizona tracks that I do like, however... I'm really not happy with this one at all. Maybe I can go up to a pawn shop and trade it for something listenable. Sorry Carter
1	The heavens are telling This is a very great chorus, and one of Haydn's best as far as i am concerned. The pace, grandness and spirit of the piece all conjure in one's imagination the majesty of heaven, and God's throne. I cannot help but be moved to praise the God of the heavens and the earth. kanmi ogundip
1	This is a Ten-Star Album If you have ever been in love, if you love listening to great music, if you want to linger a bit in the past with wonderful love songs and unsurpassed artists, THEN BUY THIS ALBUM. How can you possibly lose? The artful direction of Nelson Riddle, combined with ageless, moving love songs sung superbly by Linda Ronstadt - ladies and gentlemen - it doesn't get any better than this! In fact, if you want a collection of absolutely beautiful love songs, get all three albums by Ronstadt and Riddle: What's New; Lush Life; and For Sentimental Reasons. There is life after LP albums - thank heavens for remastered CD's. Great music forever saved. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW
1	Outstanding!!! A Great Album From Start to Finish If you are tired of the cookie cutter, assembly line garbage that passes for country music these days, then pick up this CD for a refreshing change. if you are looking for a singer who makes you sit up and pay attention to the lyrics, then this album is a must have. The songs run the gamut emotionally. From tear jerkers such as Blue Wing and Veteran's Day, to foot stomping tunes like Gallo del Cielo this album covers all the bases
0	Concepts get better with practice I love this show! That said, I do not care for this version of it. The inclusion of the word "concept" in the title means it is just that. This was, thankfully, not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One Night In Bangkok". With most Broadway musicals, the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show. If you listen to the recordings of Phantom, Mama Mia, Beauty and the Beast, you can discern the basic storyline of the show. Listening to this particular recording of Chess, though, will leave you wondering "What was that?" The Broadway arrival of Chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers. This recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that don't really relate to each other. For musical fanatics (like myself), I say "yes, you should have this recording in your collection", if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on Broadway. If you are only buying the album because of "One Night In Bangkok", purchase the Broadway recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by Phillip Casnoff rather than Murray Head
0	only 25 mins or so of music! there are only 8 songs, mildy mediocre ones at best, the total run time is around 25 minutes...on that basis alone it is not worth the 6 bucks
1	great idea, masterfully pulled off Avantasia, the metal opera - where to begin? a slew of famous power metal vocalists, top-notch instrumentation, and exciting fantasy-inspired lyrics combine to give us the first half of a two-part story created by Edguy frontman Tobias Sammet. note: it is an opera in the sense that each role is performed by a different vocalist. best tracks are Avantasia, Sign of the Cross, Glory of Rome, The Tower, and Serpents in Paradise. the instrumental tracks are well-done and don't hurt the story. Malleus Maleficarum is creepy but adds to the story. Inside is the one track you can skip - luckily, it's only two minutes long
1	Excellant combination of songs. Best of Wayne Newton Now is an excellant compilation of music. The oldies are there, a few I had never heard, but I am so glad I did. It goes from toe-tapping music to daydreaming and just plain crying songs. Since I am a long time fan and have just recently attended his Christmas show, I can assure you, this CD will not be a dissapointment
0	not very good The problem with this cd is that it is not all that good. Other than that, it is fine
1	More Trio Kurt! What a record! This is my favorite recording and context for his playing (and I have heard all he's recorded for the public). So very very good: I just got it yesterday and I can't take it off. The title cut (which [is it just me?] rings of Goodbye Pork Pie Hat), is alone worth whatever price you have to pay. Hats off to Jorge Rossy too (as always). Seriously, I hope he explores the trio setting again and again in what is sure to be a long career. It is so rare these days to hear a voice like this, where you know instantly that you're hearing a guy in for the long haul! Beautiful
0	Two great songs on this rare CD "Point of No Return" is fantastic, "I Can't Wait" a little less so. Whatever happened to this band? The two tracks above are worth the modest purchase price
1	70's inverted Another good effort, I like this one better than the last. Band is tight and the production is great. Jeff's Jesus song is awesome. However, Jim's singing is poor. He's a fine producer, but come on -- he would get polite applause AT BEST at your local open mike. This isn't a 3rd grade pageant -- not everyone gets to sing, pal
1	Classic Szell If you want to hear George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra at the peak of their famed Mozartean sound, look no further than this disc. These works, both originally chamber pieces, are perfect showpieces for Szell's chamber-music style of Mozart playing. These recordings capture Szell and the orchestra at the prime of their partnership, combining the punchy, almost gutteral orchestral sound Szell favored with transparent delineation of details and almost scary rhythmic and tonal precision. There are other, equally valid styles of playing these works, but none that are better. Of course the German Dances, with Boskovsky and his ensemble at the helm, are well played and enjoyable too, but they're the icing on a very substantial cake. Don't miss the opportunity to pick up this budget-priced piece of definitive Mozart interpretation
0	A Major Let-Down! It was water-down metal! Actually....it is S***T Metal!!!!! I purchased this album when it came out, I listened to it once and threw it in the garbage afterwards. It was that bad!!! It didnt have any of the catchy riffs of the earlier misfits. And the drums!...the drums of the old misfits gave it a unique sound...and this one! It was second-rate heavy metal/thrash drumming. This album was a terrible,terrible disappointment. I could not believe I spent my money on this album. It is a lame,sad and pathetic attempt at resurrecting the glory of the old misfits.....this album and the ones after this, proves this to be true.
0	Thank You Jerry Only You have destroyed everything the Misfits were about with this album. No wonder Glenn doesn't speak to you. Maybe he would be over your lack of musical ability if you hadn't trashed his creation. Jerry Only sold out the original fiends. This cd is a polished turd
1	Buy This Album For q.e.d. and land's end !! Here is how I see it. I am a huge fan of One Of A Kind and Spice Of Life and other Bruford albums with YES. This recording has it's moments and these are memorable moments! It also has some weak points. But I am going to focus on why you should run out and buy this now. There are two tracks on this cd that are must haves for Bruford fans. Here is what they are called...q.e.d and land's end. These two are killer!! The suspense and tension, the release after a build up, the drumming, the incredible guitar and bass work with piano is so satisfying that I would be embarressed to tell you how many times I have listened to these masterpieces. I urge you to listen to these fantastic songs over and over again! They really are that good. By the way I got to meet Bill Bruford in Oakland at Yoshi (a jazz venue) last year in the spring and he was so much fun to see with Earthworks. Anyway if you have not heard One Of A Kind, buy it now because it is the best jazz album of all time!
1	All of my favorite Neil songs on here I recall this period of Neil Diamond's hits between about 1978 and 1982. I still like Yesterday's Songs and that smooth groove. I love September Morn and its relaxing pace--sounds like you could hear it on a quiet breezy day with the windows open. America means so much now in its patriotic theme. I still love Love On The Rocks--unlike anything I heard on the radio back in 1980--it's so adventurous when I hear it. I like the rock stomp on Forever In Blue Jeans. But let's cut the chase to his classic duet with Barbra Streisand in You Don't Bring Me Flowers. At times, it's humorous, playful, romantic and emotional. It probably led to a huge duets boom in music in the late '70s as a lot of artists did duets. These days, the term most used is collaborations for these kinds of duets. But it's a pretty song, one of Neil's best songs since his upbeat '60s pop. Diamond's new album "12 Songs" has been selling well and it might get him back on top like he did with these songs on Volume 2.
0	Mr Durst, please tell the class, how does one spell ''BISCUIT?'' Limp Bizkit? Metal? The two go together like when Dante met Bosh in a crack alley in Bogota: A real big mess... Being a true metal fan (a la, Slayer, Testament, Pissing Razors and Megadeth) I find Limp Bizkit's excuse for metal as nothing more than a pathetic joke. Metal never had rap in it's fold, and to even attempt to combine the two spectrums together would be disgracing the world of metal...and I'm sure rap fans would be equally angry. Make up your mind, Durst (your stupidly miniscule mind). Are you a metaller? Or a rapper? Oh, and I suggest that Fred goes back to school so that he can pay attention in his English language lessons so that he might just learn how to spell properly.
0	Too sober - not so joyous - not what I anticipated I was not pleased with this CD - I wanted hymns rendered more joyously....
1	Containing The Monster On R.E.M.'s previous two albums, Out Of Time & Automatic For The People, the band created quiet classics by employing a wide array of beautiful instruments including mandolins, harpsichords, strings and the like. They did a complete 180 on Monster, which is anything but quiet. The album is steeped in the glam-rock of the 70's and the grunge music of its day. Peter Buck threw away the acoustic stuff, plugged in and turned the volume up to 11. The band shows off their musical aptitude as this album sounds like nothing they've done before or since. "What's The Frequency, Kenneth?" opens the album awash in buzzing guitars and undesciprable Michael Stipe vocals. "Crush With Eyeliner" is a glam-rock classic and sounds like it could be out of the David Bowie songbook. "I Don't Sleep, I Dream" is a pulsating track while "Star 69" is straight ahead, tongue-in-cheek rocker. "Tongue" is probably the band's sexiest song done in a bump and grind style. "Let Me In" is their tribute to the late Kurt Cobain. "Bang And Blame" is the best song on the album, with its synthesized sound and popping guitars. Monster was the band's first album to debut at number one and with it, they continued to push the envelope and shake up their identity. This album really benefits from the 5.1 audio as the original album is full of buzzing guitars & distortion and the mix makes for a richer sound
0	Ack... eject! You see the name Andrew Lloyd Webber and assume it can't be horrible right? WRONG! When I put this CD into my player I was horrified. Some of the music was ok, but most of it was awful and cheesy. The London cast putting on southern accents are really bad. The lead character Swallow, has a voice made for a high school production, but not a soundtrack like this. This is not typical ALW, Musical Theater, or good music. This is good milk gone sour. I do however like the voice of the character Amos (pronounced in this CD as AY-MOSS) which is why my favorite song is "Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts" I suggest this for collectors, and ALW fans, but don't expect the normal, this is a new rock-christian ALW.
0	Boring This music is boring. All tangos have the same tempo. No milongas. What a shame! Trying to do routines to this music would be a waste of time. This CD sounds like background music in a lounge.
1	But it for 'Frances the Mute' Like Pete said, Frances the Mute is supposed to be the first song of the album by the same title. I wondered whether getting a cd single would be worth it just for the one song (since I already had the Widow from FTM the album), and after hearing it, I don't think I could listen to the full album again without starting off with the FTM song. It seems that critical to the album. It starts off with about 4 and a half minutes of what sounds like metal clanging, like prison bars or something, then picks up with the main part of the song, simple but powerful. When that ends after a few minutes, you get a few minutes of very slow, quiet beautifully depressing and haunting section and then builds for the grand finale to the song and drifts into the opening FTM the album where "the ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens" picks up. Trust me, for hardcore fans, this IS essential. If anything, download. You need this
1	THE BEST .38 ALBUM EVER!!! I'VE BEEN A FAN OF .38 SINCE THEIR FIRST ALBUM, AND THIS RANKS FROM FIRST TRACK TO LAST AS THEIR BEST EFFORT IN MY OPINION. DON BARNES AND DONNIE VAN ZANT EACH LEND THEIR DISTINCTIVE VOICES TO SUCH ROCKERS AS 'CHAINED LIGHTNING' AND 'BACK DOOR STRANGER'. THE GUITAR WORK OF BARNES AND JEFF CARLISI WAS NEVER BETTER. SOUTHERN ROCK AT IT'S FINEST!!
0	It's about time for Trent to retire to the producing world . . . This album was an absolute disappointment. I've never thought of a Nine Inch Nails album as fun, but the only redeeming quality for With Teeth is that some of the songs ("Only", "You Know Who You Are") are just fun. The others fall somewhere in the realm of pretentious, irritating, or just plain bad. Here are the main problems, as I see them: 1. Lyrics - this should come as no suprise, though, as Trent was never a poet. Take love/sex, add addiction, frustration, inadequacy, failure, deviance, etc., and you have 80% of the Nine Inch Nails songs ever written. Additionally, Trent cannot sing . . . or scream!!! His range lies somewhere around mumble and whine. This is easy to see past when the music is good, but not on this album. 2. Lack of Complexity - NIN has always been interesting, if not good, musically. Trent laid on the synth layers thick, and it was possible to listen to an album (The Fragile) many times and keep noticing new things he was doing musically. That doesn't happen here -- this is very one-dimensional and boring. 3. Not Innovative - NIN was good because he/they did things that no one had done before musically, and that in and of itself was exciting. NIN never sounded like anything else, though there were a lot of knock-offs in his/their wake. Either the technology is so accessible that everyone is doing what NIN used to be the only ones to do, or Trent Reznor got lazy, because this sounds like every other piece of electronic-rock crap to come out in the past decade (except with Trent Reznor's voice).
1	Sad signs of decline As the title suggests, this is Ice-T's return. But the return to exactly what? It could be viewed as either the return to the forefront of hip-hop, or the return to his roots, end of the 80s style of hip-hop. While I'm sure Ice thought of the former, the resulting album doesn't quite achieve any of the two "Return to" targets. There are two very notable changes in Ice-T style here. First is in the lyrics department. While Ice is as intelligent and witful as ever, he has toned down his verses a lot. Gone is the almost uncontrolled aggression of "Home Invasion". Instead we have mostly slow to mid-tempo tracks, most of which deal with the topics of either rap game and its rules, or warns against being a gangster. This change is quite understandable for a man about to turn 40 years old. The lyrics are mostly good and to the point. Though I must admit I still find the 2 love ballads here to be somewhat out of place. The other notable change is in the music. It has advanced from basic beats and noises towards more rich soundscape. Most of the tracks, especially the slower ones, attempt to develop a feeling of uneasiness and tension, and most of the times it works. So why do I think this album is one more step on the way down? Because taken as a whole, it lacks the focus and a sense of general direction that "O.G." maintained perfectly. Not a single time did I cringe, realizing that this or that track is just a filler ("Forced To Do Dirt", anyone?). Another turn off might be that old-school feeling of the whole attempt, which simply sounds out of tune with the general development of rap. Clearly Ice-T wanted to put himself back in the game. But as much as I respect his previous efforts, more often than not I vision a man in his late 30s who is generally unsure as to what kind of music really works in 1996, and his songs often sound strained and entirely forced out. That being said, for long time fans, which I am one of, this is generally a nice little album, that is worth to be listened to occasionally. But it's far from being a mandatory purchase
1	Art rock genius...an essential. When Roxy Music reunited in 2001, they dipped into the bulk of this album, unfortunately, Brian Eno didn't take part in the shows. But in 1973, they recorded an album so far ahead of its time that it still sounds futuristic today. The sax, synths and screaming guitars along with Ferry's haunting vocals make for creepy afterhours listening. Those who are only familiar with Roxy and Bryan from the 80s on are going to be shocked when they hear this. Those who love Ziggy-era as well as the Eno-Fripp and Eno-Bowie collaborations will love it. Those who have watched Rocky Horror can picture Richard O'Brien listening to this relentlessly. You can hear Radiohead putting this one on as a point of reference for their more recent work (Thom Yorke does a fairly decent Ferry soundalike on the "Velvet Goldmine" soundtrack). You can hear Tangerine Dream, Can and Kraftwerk taking notes as well as goth pioneers like bauhaus and Joy Division cutting their teeth on this one, or Bowie and Peter Gabriel seeing how "the enemy" is doing. Another name that came to mind was director David Lynch, who would work with Eno on a "Dune" track. You can picture Bono and Edge discussing the songs... There are accessible songs like "Do The Strand" and "Editions of You", and then you have "Bogus Man", "In Every Dream Home a Heartache" and "For Your Pleasure" which are as far out as you can get.
1	Incredible. Buy it NOW! I agree with other reviewers who wonder how anybody could give this less than 5 stars. This album sticks with you over time as few can. It is like listening to a psyche explode into madness, from the tight grip of "schizophrenia" to the noise that builds with "Kotton Krown" and continues through the chaos of "White Dick." I recommend this as somewhat of a SY apostate. I admit that I listen to Goo more than EVOL, and have defended Goo even in heated exchanges with random strangers in bars. It seems that Daydream Nation is the watershed moment (read "sell out") for most "true" SY fans and I was surprised to see Sister and DN linked in so many of these Amazon reviews. They are completely different, and if you though DN was experimental, maybe you should not go back any further in the SY catalogue. Avoid Sister. I also agree with reviewers who tout this as far superior to most "indie" or non-indie music for that matter. There is an authenticity here, as with all SY, that one doesn't find anymore, an attitude about making music as art without regard for sales or singles or airplay (even on the "classic alternative" stations popping up in SoCal and soon to be exported to your suburb). You listen to Sister and you understand how pervasive SY is in their influence, from the Pixies to Nirvana to the White Stripes, it don't exist without early SY. Not to say that bands copy SY, it's just that their music, exemplified by this record, is infectious and so deeply layered in sound and attitude that, like VU before them, it would be hard not to show some influence. If you are new to SY and want a great starter album, Sister is where to go, then buy EVOL and Daydream Nation, move toward the fine work from the early 90s (Goo, Dirty, Experimental Jet Set...) and on to Murray Street
1	great sound great performance great sound great performance, pity there were no other hard to find jems besides "start me up
1	Real jazz Just great jazz, and it's enough to tell about that. Coltarne, Tyner, Garrison & Jones give you a piece of music you cannot forget. You love jazz, you love it.
0	Career suicide Eight long years after this album was released and I figure I might as well write a review. I know what people say, that, it wasn't the Downward Spiral 2. Well, I was hoping for something equally as impressive as the Downward Spiral, not the same. I realize bands move on, grow up, GET OLD, but, such a contrast. The Downward Spiral, and previous works, were a progressive movement towards something.. something. The Fragile may have been that something. The world will never know. I wonder...who will hold the chalice next? Blame it on fear, blame it on drugs, blame it on pressure, blame it on whatever, but, this album is the ultimate opportunity lost. Successive works, such as "With Teeth", are just flat out laughable. Was Nine Inch Nails ever a great band? I have my doubts... yet, I can still remember being dumbstruck by the glory of Mr. Self Destruct that first time... As far as I'm concerned, this album was Trent's fall from Godhood. This album has no purpose, no progression. It's a mess of half committed tracks and trivial ambience. There is no plot, no experience. While Downward Spiral was a journey to something divine, this album, however, lacks any magic whatsoever. This album WILL NOT change you. Oh, NiN will still be around, perhaps for ten more years, perhaps even twenty. But, that spirit, that anger, that POWER which is found in the Downward Spiral and Broken will never show itself again. The sincerity is but a fading memory, and to those just discovering NiN, will never be felt. All in all, I would rather have never been born than live in a post Fragile world. It was that disapointing to me, and still is. One star for destroying one of the only joys of my childhood
1	Lyrically and Truthfully BRUTAL !!! Alice ... you are a smart Christian, you tell it how you see it and you see it correct, now all you have to do is stop hanging around with that bum Rob Zombie. Anyways, onto the album ... its great, not so melodical and not as great as The Last Temptation but still awesome, its heavy, deep and the lyrics leave a lasting impression. Also I would like to add how great his latest album Dirty Diamonds is, it varies in song styles with great production and catchy tunes geniously written. Just remember, God is great and Alice is cooler than cool
1	Lester, "Pres" for the friends Lester Young.What more can I say ? He was the most incredible jazz player of all times. The king of tenor saxophone.He recorded this session in 1956,three years before his death,with some outstanding companions : Teddy Wilson,Vic Dickenson,Roy Eldridge,Freddie Greene,Gene Ramey and Jo Jones.What a hall of fame!!Just listen to the magnificent version of "I'll guess I'll have to change my plan",a tune rarely recorded.This is some of the greatest Lester, a real masterpiece; for Lester's playing,but also for Teddy Wilson,Jo Jones,and for an amazing Roy Eldridge.I guess you'll play this tune for hours.Roy 's solo on this tune ranks among the greatest things ever done on a trumpet.The four other tunes are very great moments of music too: Lester's improvisations on "I didn't know what time it was" or "this year's kisses",a tune he recorded with Billie Holiday some 20 years before.The Jazz Giants is a good title: noone will ever play that way
1	Rediscovering Rick If you are looking to relive some favorite tunes from the past, "The Day After Yesterday" by Rick Springfield is a good one!!! However, if you are looking for "Jessie's Girl" and "Don't Talk to Strangers," this one is NOT for you. Although this offering differs greatly from much of Springfield's most popular tunes, I like it!!! As a fan rediscovering Rick, I appreciate what his mature voice lends to each cut. This album helps to confirm my belief that musicians (just like everyone else) should change and grow, take divergent paths, explore, rediscovery, etc. and not stay the same - play the same tunes in the same old way. Rick's last album, "Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance," contains many raw and hard-hitting tracks. This one does not. Take it for what it is - he is not selling it as anything but songs that he wished he had written. I appreciate the various offerings by an artist over his/her career span (buy this one and "Anthology -Written in Rock" released in 2005 and "Karma" in 1999 to see what I mean).
1	A Rare Bird One of thoses rare combinations of perfectly executed content and content perfectly executed. One of the great rock albums not only of that decade but to date. That it was a first album is even more impressive. This is one I go back to again and again.
0	BUYER BEWARE - The 2001 Remaster by Universal Music/One Way. Don't get me wrong. The music that makes up 'Phantoms' by The Fixx is absolutely unique and wonderful. The one star is aimed at the corporation(s) that now own(s) these recordings. In an attempt to give the fans of this music something to enjoy, Universal Music/One Way Records has screwed this one up - BAD. How? They reversed the stereo image. To illustrate this all you need to do is imagine that guitar part that was previously known to reside on the left in the stereo spectrum - in the "remaster" it is now on the right. While that harmony vocal that you had previously heard on the left of the stereo spectrum is now -yup- on the right of the stereo spectrum. Therefore, a complete reversal of the stereo image - in every song, from start to finish. Kids, this is a major bummer. In 1984 I purchased the vinyl version of 'Phantoms', which I grew to quickly love. So when it hit CD for the first time I added that to my library without hesitation. But like many of those recordings that were transferred from the original analog tapes to CD format in the 80's, I found the sound of the CD lacking warmth and bass response. Because of that reason I hung onto my original vinyl through the years. Recently, when I learned that 'Phantoms' had been "remastered" and reissued - I was hoping to get the listening experience that this music so much deserved when it first hit CD. I am very sorry to say that it didn't happen with Universal Music's "remaster". It's a shame. The fact that three years after the re-release (it came out in 2001) no one has publicly voiced their discovery of this not insignificant error is a little surprising to me. If I hadn't of A/B tested this "remaster" to both the original vinyl and the original CD release by MCA Records then I may not have caught the reversed stereo image error right away. Thankfully, I did, and HOPEfully someone will do something about it. I would also like to point out that I am deeply disappointed that Universal/One Way Records did not use the original liner notes for 'Phantoms', which in essence DIScredits all of those people who were originally responsible for producing the music and getting it out there. I see no clear reason for leaving those people out and in their place only giving credit to the "reissue producer" and "remastering engineer". Again, all of this is regrettable and shameful because 'Phantoms' truly deserves much better.
0	Did not receive both disks I ordered this for my father, and according to him, there was only one disk in the package. Very disappointing. He didn't want to bother with sending it back.
1	Phenomenal! Well, I completely disagree with the negative review below, and I have a feeling that the gentleman who wrote it, who claims to be a mediocre picker of several instruments, will remain mediocre for his entire life. Fiddle and violin are not the same thing. As the old joke goes, the difference between the two is that you shouldn't spill beer on a violin. To expect rural and traditional black fiddlers from the Depression to play fiddle like classically trained modern fiddlers like Mark O'Connor or Allison Krauss is like expecting your country Grandma to make Hazelnut-crusted filet of Chilean Seabass with a Pomegranate and Wasabi reduction for Sunday dinner, instead of pot roast and mashed potatoes. It's an absurd expectation. This is the music of real people. Many of these musicians undoubtedly farmed or did other backbreaking labor all week, taking their only joy from the music they'd play on the weekend. Their faithful listeners were in the same boat. Remember that for many of these recordings, the concept of "jazz" hadn't been invented yet. Bluegrass, for that matter, wouldn't be invented for a couple more decades. Anyone with a genuine appreciation for American traditional and folk music will love this album. Yes, some of the recording quality is a little bit rough (many of the songs sound like they're playing on an old turntable instead of on a CD), but it's completely listenable, not nearly as difficult to listen to as many other re-released gems from this era. Listen to it with an open mind, and after you've heard the first few tunes, your brain will automatically tune out the static (which is minimal to begin with). This album is one of the more brilliant re-releases and collections from this era. Get an idea of what real people were listening to and playing in this time period. You'll thank yourself for giving it a try
0	If you want to hear "fiddle" music don't buy this! This is a review for normal people. If you are a fan of standard fiddle do not buy this CD. It is a bunch of badly recorded, half hearted, boring and sloppy songs thrown together on an overpriced CD. Save yourself $... or if you like this type of music just go buy some old Little Rascals episodes on DVD. Then you will get the same music you hear on this plus the bonus of the Little Rascals. Now I know why we think of Blues guitar players not fiddle players when this music is discussed. The other reviewers seem to think some of the names on this CD will be familiar to you. Don't believe them, unless names like "Abrew's Portuguese Instrumental Trio" or "Dixieland Jug Blowers" are familiar to you. I am just hoping to prevent normal music lovers from stepping into this pile and losing $... like I did. I play banjo, fiddle, mandolin, dulcimer and guitar all badly, but I could get a gig with these bands and probably improve their sound. If you are the artsy type that digs this kind of stuff and you can't wait to grow a goatee, turn the lights down low, fill the room with smoke (oops, bad for your health), put your sunglasses on and crank this baby up; I hope you don't mind being stuck by yourself all the time because no one else is going to put up with this lousy music. Go find something with Chubby Wise in it if you want to hear some real fiddle playing. Help support some little known, up and coming fiddle players that need to buy food and pay rent with royalty checks by buying their music instead of making these labels, that get this junky music for free or almost free, super rich
1	All the sixties classics This compilation covers the period 1964 to 1971 - the stuff that really matters. The same label has released a double CD compilation tit1led Ultimate collection, which covers their later music as well. If you want their later hits, including Come dancing, that is the collection you should go for. This contains all the classic sixties songs including You really got me, All day and all of the night, Tired of waiting for you, Dedicated follower of fashion, Well respected man, Sunny afternoon, Waterloo sunset, Autumn almanac, Days, Lola and Apeman. It also includes Dave's two solo UK hits - Death of a clown and Susannah's still alive. The set is presented in chronological order beginning with their cover of Long tall Sally, a song that demonstrates their musical roots in R+B. They didn't stick to R+B for very long, becoming more of a mainstream pop group and continually changing their style thereafter. Nevertheless, their songs were always distinctive because of Ray's talent for making ordinary situations into extraordinary songs. My favorite Kinks song is Waterloo sunset, a huge UK hit but not an American hit. It is about romance at a railway station that I am familiar with, though I cannot possibly imagine what inspired Ray to write that song, but he was a genius. The best tribute to the quality of their songs lies in the diversity of the covers that have been recorded by singers in several genres of music. Kirsty MacColl (Days), the Stranglers (All day and all of the night), Petula Clark (Days - and a French version of Well respected man), Cathy Dennis (Waterloo sunset, Sunny afternoon), Green day (Tired of waiting for you), Jimmy Buffett (Sunny afternoon), Van Halen (You really got me) and Barb Jungr (Waterloo sunset) are among those who have covered Kinks songs. Despite the brilliance of some of the covers, here you get the chance to hear the original versions. If you just want a single CD of their sixties music, this one is as good as any you will find
0	A Grave Dissapointment After all the hype I expected this disc to be great. Boy was I wrong. I love the Wailing Souls but I cannot even listen to this. What were they thinking??? A truly poor and weird output from one of my favorite reggae harmony trios. The first track, "Row Fisherman", is such a bad version of a great song. Skip this and buy Firehouse Rock or Face the Devil. Even better try and find a copy of their first (and best) lp from 1974
1	Too great to cry This album demonstrates how absolutely phenomenal a singer and fiddler Alison Krauss since her early teens! Sheer delight to trace her gracious development as artist, leader, and influence over the decades
0	They could have made a better compilation I don't want to pinpoint any one of the releases in the Anthology series because they're all guilty of just being thrown together with alternate takes, television outtakes, inferior rough recordings and false starts. The unrleleased material (that which has been bootlegged for years), however, is what brings us out of the overbearing potpourri. I have always been a fan of the unreleased early material including the Decca record audition tracks. In fact, the first side of A1 could have done without the spoken word breaks and got down to some rock and roll, but if they only started from track 10 ("My Bonnie") and stopped at "Lend Me Your Comb" only to tack on "Leave My Kitten Alone" and leave it at that. But that's just one example of how this should have been executed for release. The other two Anthologies are worthy of scrutiny as well. This is yet another disappointment for me such as was with Rubber Soul when I first bought it on CD. The fact that the Beatles were going to give a good portion of their unreleased material the light of day got me excited until the day the Anthologies were released. I give two stars particularly for the two new John Lennon songs that were Beatle-ized for this 6-disc compilation though
1	estrella morente an amazing singer! she is fantastic and the entire album is wonderful. Great selection for lovers of flamenco and Spanish music
0	cd song selection for this box set could of been much better of all the billboard cds, this box set of 85-89 does not contain enough of the top hits of this period. most of the songs are of the flip side vintage. the grouping and selection of songs surely does not reflect the top hits of 1985-89.a far cry from the best of billboards efforts on previous years. for myself, a disappointment
1	The bomb! If you didn't know him from Hootie and the Blowfish, don't worry, you didn't miss much! But, if you don't purchase this CD, you will be missing a lot! He is courageous to buck against the record companies and go independent! Thanks Darius because this CD is the bomb! If you don't want to take my word for it, just listen to Wild One! Great song to put in your car's CD changer to drive to this summer
0	UGH Terrible. I LOVE alternative music, but this trash is hardly worth listening to. I understand this is "experimental" and "innovational" but it is a loose can of worms. None of the music is melodic. Some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when Thurston Moore or Kim Gordon (who was 39 when this was recorded. Waaaay past her prime if you ask me) tries to sing, it all falls apart. The guitarists are very, very talented and deserve recognition. But, honestly, I can't see how they can't be like the Pixies and be talented but produce GOOD and LISTENABLE music at the same time. I gave it 2 stars because "Drunken Butterfly" Is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through
0	George Winston? If you like the music of George Winston's earlier albums, especially the "seasons," December, Plains, Forest, Montana.....you will probably not like this one. Unfortunately, it is nothing like his earlier works. I would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like Gulf Coast Blues. This new one is way too heavy, loud, and generally abrasive. I am very sorry to have to say these things, because I am such a big fan of his.
0	Not up to George Winston's Standard of Excellence I was disappointed in this CD and have only played it once. There was nothing about the music that "grabbed" me or even made me identify with New Orleans jazz or blues. Not what I expected, but I was still happy to contribute to the hurricane relief effort.
0	A musician tells it like it is..Rodgers rolling in his grave Unfortunately, I read the other reviews posted here and bought this recording based on the glowing sentiments expressed. Hmph. If this is what people think a great recording is, then musicality has certainly taken an alarming turn for the worse. A few people did mention that the voices might not be the best, but seem to think that this is a small matter. Guess what -- the two lead singers ARE pretty darn bad, and to me it's a big deal. They are marginal singers, at best. I can only assume that acting and dancing are valued more than truly beautiful voices anymore, and that the music is taking a back seat to more visual concerns. It was actually, quite literally, painful for me to listen to the tracks sung by Riding and Hayden. Every time that we want a musical delivery, we're cheated of the pay-off. Rodgers and Hammerstein created works of genius that are pure musical wonder, and this particular work deserves passion, feeling and true musical prowess from the performers. This recording sorely lacks these qualities. The only redeeming qualities - the singing of Clive Rowe as Enoch Snow and nice conducting in the Prologue. Otherwise, save your money and - no, don't save your money - buy another recording like the old one with Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae and listen to some good voices. Really. Trust me. I have a fine set of musical ears and I know voices
0	Part of history but the music is very ... BAD The music on this anthology disk is very bad. You have to "want" to like the Germs. You must have alternative motives. Your mind must already be set before you press "Play" for the first time. Maybe somebody cool that you know liked the Germs or maybe they were name dropped in a magazine you like or that guy from the Offspring wearing his blue circle logo Germs T-shirt is burned deep in your psyche... maybe you just like the name "Germs"? It is a cool name for a band and they do have a cool minimalist logo. If you were to first encounter this music blindfolded wearing headphones and without any knowledge that this music is the Germs, you would likely rip off the headphones, take a couple asprin and run for the hills. Why? because this music is just plain BAD
1	Good album This ablum contains all of the Germ's singles and their only studio album. This is an incredible punk album and belongs in your album collection if you're a fan of punk. Everything in the CD is perfect except the fact the Sex Boy has horrible sound quality (but whats funny is that on the last page of the booklet it says ''We make NO apologies for the sound quality of any of these recordings) but its quite funny to hear the choas that is going on while they perform. I highly recommend this collection of recordings
1	Smif-N-Wessun - Dah Shinin After Black Moon dropped "Enta Da Stage" in 1993, people knew about Boot Camp was about. Then 2 years later in 1995, Smif N Wessun came up with a CLASSIC debut album! This is the second album to come out of the Boot Camp Clik. If you thought Black Moons "Enta Da Stage" was classic, then you HAVE to pick this up now!! The lyrics on this album are on point all the way through. Words about life on the streets, fakes, and just all that hood and real hip-hop! Lyric wise, youll feel the same type of lyrics like those from Black Moons debut album. They wont dissapoint! The production on this album deserves these words... Insanely dope! If you heard Black Moons first album, you knew that "Da Beatminerz" were on about every track, youll find the same thing here! Da Beatminerz are back for more DOPE beatmaking! I don't think there is one weak beat on this album, you got those heavy bass, and just straight bangers! To sum it up, just like me tell you this. If you like Boot Camp, Black Moon, Heltah Skeltah or any of it, or good hip-hop, do not... I repeat.. do not pass up picking up this album! Its DOPE!!!! My Top 5 Songs 1.Wrektime 2.Wontime 3.Bucktown 4.Cession At Da Doghillee 5.Wrekoniz
0	Not John Lee Hooker Well, of course it is John Lee Hooker, but these slick, mushy recordings are very, very far from Hooker's gritty 40s, 50s and 60s waxings, and songs like the saccahrine, string-laden "Six-Page Letter" are even wussier than the worst of his late 80s/early 90s guest star recordings. Hooker obviously didn't have a chance to listen to the final mixes. Whatever you do, make sure you listen to this album before buying it
1	Decent effort For the record I'm not really a Dry Kill Logic fan per say. I own their first two records and I've heard all of the new one. I'd have to say The Dead and Dreaming is their "crowning" effort. Now first off, nothing about this band is really original. There were already so many metal bands out there playing these same old riffs for over ten years so by the time DKL came around it was already old. However, the crushing energy and agression cannot be ignored. The mellower parts are very boring and when he sings it sounds like Linkin Park-esque vocals. Nothing special there. So anyway, if you like your metal loud and angry, but low on the technical and originality scale then Dry Kill Logic is for you. This is their heaviest album and packs a punch. Better than Limp Bizkit, Korn, Hatebreed and all that mess, but I'll still stick to my Slayer, Opeth, and Testament albums
1	Santana Goes Back On Top Moonflower put Santana back into the charts, and back into the major music mainstream. This is the first Platinum album since Santana III in 1971. Moonflower went on to sell TEN MILLION copies worlwide. The two preceding albums, Amigos and Festival, got Santana out of the heavy jazz fusion genre, and back into more "radio friendly" Afro-Cuban rock, like the early days. A few hits came, e.g. Dance Sister Dance, Let It Shine, Let The Children Play, etc. But not until She's Not There did Santana REALLY crack the charts. The whole album is extremely good. All of the live tracks are superb. There is not a single weak spot on the album. The bonus tracks are extra. The album would be just as good, maybe even better if the bonus tracks weren't there. They are completely unnecessary, shortened versions of the original versions on the album. But you can just skip those. Get the album
1	A revelation revisited I have been listening to this record for about 25 years, so when this newly engineered release came out I was eager to hear the new tracks. They are stunning. I Once Loved a Boy is especially tender and tinged with that slightly bitter, ineffable Joan Baez melancholy that no other singer I know of in folk music has captured. There is and has been no other voice like this in popular music. Listen to this CD and you will put down every other singer songwriter du jour for a long while. This is in another dimension
1	Quite possibly their best yet This album is battling to become my favourite Sugababes album. It is in competition with Three, which is magnificent. This album, the last with Mutya, has some of their finest songs to date and some brilliant production and lyrics. At only 11 tracks long (12 if you have the UK bonus track, which I don't), it seems short, but packs a lot into those 11 tracks. My rundown: 01. Push The Button (9/10) The lead single of the album, this was No.1 in the UK for 3 (I think?) weeks. It's immediately catchy and very easy to sing along to. Keisha leads most of the song, with Mutya and Heidi singing the verses. Fun, upbeat with a saucy video. 02. Gotta Be You (9/10) Another upbeat song, this is really catchy, with a repetitive chorus that you would expect to get boring, but somehow it doesn't. The first time I played this, I was like 'Boooooring' but now I love it, it's a lot of fun to sing along to. The girls share vocals out throughout the song. 03. Follow Me Home (10/10) This ballad is reminscient of songs from Three like "Caught In A Moment", "Too Lost In You" and "Sometimes". That, my friends, is a very good thing. This song is beautiful and moving - I absolutely love the chorus, it's amazing! Heidi is absolutely brilliant on the middle 8, and Mutya and Keisha do the remainder of the song well. One of my favourites! 04. Joy Division (9/10) Another upbeat song, this song is slightly strange with peculiar lyrics music. It's catchy with singable bits throughout. I don't know why it's called "Joy Division," they don't mention those words anywhere in the song. Anyway, a good song, if strange. 05. Red Dress (7/10) This is the Babes new single and first single with Amelle. I wish it wasn't and that they had chosen something else, this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album. I don't know why, but this song is bland and uninteresting to me. The chorus is slightly catchy though, and Amelle does improve the song somewhat. 06. Ugly (8/10) This song is probably my other least favourite. The Babes Christmas single, this reached No.3. I loved it on the first listen, but after repeated plays, it has gotten boring. "Ugly" has a brilliant message behind it about accepting people as they are and not judging people by their looks, but to me, it's bland and boring. But it's Mutya's last single with the group, so good on it. 07. It Ain't Easy (9/10) The shortest track on the album, clocking in at 3:05, this is fast paced and upbeat. The chorus is really catchy, and gets caught in your head instantly. Before you know it, the song is over! But that's a good thing, it keeps your attention with it's short length. 08. Bruised (9/10) This song is incredibly cool, it's very chilled out and relaxed, until Keisha starts singing the bridge. This song is another catchy one, and I like singing along to the chorus, which Heidi leads. Another very cool track. 09. Obsession (10/10) I didn't even know this song was a cover until recently. But even if it is, it's brilliant! The lyrics are kinda random, about being obsessed with somebody, but the girls' vocals are really cool. Very catchy with great music. 10. Ace Reject (10/10) This song is wonderful! Heidi's middle 8 is absolutely brilliant, her vocals and the lyrics are just amazing. The song takes almost 2 minutes to get to the chorus, it's a different format of song then just verse-bridge-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus-middle 8-chorus. Very cool song, with a catchy chorus (when it finally kicks in). 11. 2 Hearts (10++++/10) This is it! The very last track on the album is my absolute favourite. This song is absolutely, utterly amazing. Heidi leads the majority of the song, singing the first verse, first bridge and leading the chorus, whereas Mutya sings the second verse and Keisha sings the middle 8. This song is so beautiful - full of amazing instrumentals (especially the ending) and a wonderful chorus with great lyrics - "2 you's, 2 me's, 2 minds to please" is just one line. I absolutely &lt;3333 this song so much, one of my favourite Babes songs ever! Overall, the album's quality of songs is amazing, apart from two songs, the rest is high quality and brilliant. A great 4th album, look forward to more from the Babes with Amelle
1	Getting better all the time. The first two CD's were wonderful ( Five star ), but on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this CD a 11+. The Greencards just get better and better. This CD has about everything an album could ask for. Just enough slow material and then they crank it up with some great picking. The vocals are as perfect as you can get. Carol Young is one of the best female vocalist out there today, bar none. Emmon and Kim join in for great harmony and lead singing, plus their playing is incredible. This band is fast becoming the best of New Grass since the New Grass Revival split up. Buy this CD if you love great music. It will have you patting your foot and singing along.
0	Truly, welcome to the suck. And this year's crud-fest winner, the person who received the most votes from every brain-dead glossy eyed plankton watching ..... who even CARES anymore? Yet another drone pulled off the production line, this gimp being another in the long run of Inoffensive Handsome White Boys, aimed primarily at stupid people and, judging by the popularity of this single, there are an awful, awful lot of. So let's talk about the single. With the exception of the excrement that was last years winner (Steve Brookstein, currently Missing In Action - yet another one-hit wonder who we'll never see again) first (and only) solo attempt - the dire Phil Collins cover, this is easily the worst actual attempt at a SONG yet. Originally planned for Westlife, "That's My Goal" was panned and rejected by them (THEM! Westlife!) for being too weak, but it sure wasn't weak enough for Shayne Ward, currently number one for the fourth week running as I type this. But what does that MEAN, exactly? I'll tell you - nothing. The general public are SUCH idiots, such pathetic, "tell us what to buy and we will" easily led cretins, that they would buy ANYTHING after seeing it on a reality program. Shayne Ward could have released a record of him whistling the Marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one. And it's going to continue, isn't it? This was a massive hit, the show was a massive hit, so we're going to continue to be bombarded with bland, generic singers and pointless songs like this. If you BOUGHT this junk, or if you WATCHED this junk, The Curmudgeon holds YOU personally responsible. You should be ASHAMED of yourself for bringing yourself down to the gutter masses, watching this easily-digestible pond-life program, and buying its cynical, disgusting products. One day, I hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television, where TV schedules and budgets are not ruled by programs aimed at the great unwashed, where the charts are not in the vice-like grasp of dire TV talent show winners (and losers). That, ladies and gentlemen, THAT, is my goal. The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u
1	awesome, it shows ammons at his absolute best! This is a great recording to say the least, but i have to say, stitt has played better. his work with bud powell and sonny rollins, i thought was better than this. that said, it is a classic. ammons is in top form, check him out on counter clockwise and blues up and down. there is a great sense of atmosphere, like you're really there, with stitt hooting ammons along in his solos. The rhythm section is more than solid, and it should sit right up there inthe best of your collection
1	All I Feel I Hope I truly enjoy this whole cd. I own all of Toad the Wet Sprocket official releases. I have never been disappointed by any of there releases. Still, I do have which one of their releases are my favorites. This cd is one of the favorites...if anything for the track "Hope." A beautifully haunting ethereal song which I enjoy playing on those cloudy rainy days. Great lyrics, great musicianship, and great artistry. Great work from these guys....Well done!!!
0	Their worst effort yet I am a long-time fan of the boys from Brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid. They recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team. The slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time. I have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but "Homegrown" is one that was played three times and each time I never got past track #4. Save your cash on this one. A truely bad effort. They did, however, hit gold when they recorded their recent "Who You Fighting For." Now that one is worth the $$$
0	Don't buy if you have iPod The songs on the CD are great. Jane Monheit has a beautiful voice and she performs several christmas classics well. This "enhanced" version is horrible however. Sony has "enhanced" this version of the CD so that you cannot import the music into iTunes and then subsequently play it in your iPod. You can only use it in Sony digital players
1	A Classic! Faith No more, Classic Melodies, Eternal Tunes, Quirky Lyrics angel dust for sure! Songs I never get tired of hearing, even after years and years. Mike Patton is a complicated one-man orchestra not out ther for to make the easily digestible. Subtle musical intricacies and weaving insrtuments, I hear something new every time. Composition wise, I'd rank him up there with Mozart. A few songs fall a little short, but where they're on, they're very on
1	Happy Birthday, Association! It was 1968, and The Association, hot off the success of their third album, "Insight Out," and it's monster hit single, "Windy," went back into the studio and recorded their fourth album, "Birthday." Once again, this classy sextet deliver some of the best flower-power pop-rock ever made. These catchy, melodic songs are truly awesome, highlighted by the band's expert musical chemistry and vocal harmonies. The album includes more Association classics as "Like Always," "Everything That Touches You," "Time For Livin'," and "Time It Is Today," but also such great buried treasures like the punchy "Come On In," the beautiful "Rose Petals, Incense And A Kitten" (a silly title, I know, but the song is truly gorgeous), the equally exquisite "Toymaker," the haunting "Barefoot Gentleman," and the excellent "Bus Song," featuring a great bit of barbershop vocalising in the middle. When it comes to pop-rock, The Association were (and are) true geniuses. "Birthday" is a brilliant album, one of the band's best.
0	The reason why shred is dead When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album. Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff. Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding. The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.
0	America lose focus of their strengths America's first album from 1972, the self-titled one, was a masterpiece. This is the third album (as the title suggests) from 1974. So what's it like? I find that this band have very rarely focused on what they are good at, that is acoustic pop. Too often they have tried to be an eerie, progressive rock band, a funk band, an adult contemporary band and what not. Only the self titled album, some of it's folow up (homecomming) and 'Human Nature' from about 25 years later deal with what America are all about, country guys singing about countryside and birds and how we could all live a better life if we relaxed more. The problem with "Hat-trick" is that it doesn't play to America's strengths, at all. It tries to be a progressive rcok album and mixes in all these airy-fiary psuedo-satanic lyrics into their music. Like the 8-minute title track is about a broken teenage love affair, but then they start saying "You're a bat out of hell", but it doesn't work. If you're going to sing about "Bats out of hell" sing it with conviction, like Dewey sings on something like "Hangover", don't sing all soft. I mean they are a soft-folk rock band trying to sing about scary monsters getting you in the middle of the night. On the plus side you get the tracks on the Greatest hits album; "Muskrat Love", "Rainbow Song" and "She's Gonna Let You Down", all vintage 70's pop. I can't remember anything memorable from the other songs. "Green Monkey" and "Molten Love" try to sound so scary, but don't. "Willow tree lullaby" is the best of the rest but doesn't feel like much more than a card-carrying folk track that feels rather throw-away. Overall I would give the album about 3/10 (1.5 stars) They never really recovered from poor directional decisions, though have made some pretty good music since, though the best album since their first album is surely "Human Nature". That bitchin' done, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection and I hope you enjoy it, because, why did they make the album? For someone out there to enjoy themselves while they listened to it. This "old scrooge" didn't, but hopefully you do.
1	A great compilation I really like Al Stewart's style - he has an easygoing, yet catchy style that is definately his own. He's a little like Gerry Rafferty, a little bit Beatle-esque and a tad bit like Bob Dylan, but he's got his own great style. This compilation is very good, it hits all the high points and has excellent sound. My favorite songs of his were always "The Year Of The Cat" and "Time Passages", but all of the songs are very good and listenable. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes good folk/soft/pop rock
0	Not as Good as I Remember it Being I had this one in high school. I remember loving it. After purchasing it, I realized it wasn't as good as I remembered it being. Granted, it has brought back quite a few memories, but I don't really know if they're really worth remembering. It's up to you, buy it if you want
0	Shipping The product was great; unfortunately, I ordered it in December 2006, with a promise of delivery around Jan. 9. The CD did not arrive until January 26th!!! I almost reordered it by that time. What happened here?
1	Burrell & Trane Burrell (g) Coltrane (ts) Tommy Flanagan (p) Paul Chambers (b) Jimmy Cobb (d) 3/7/58. Trane was in his "sheets of sound" period at this time, and he and Burrell make a good pair. FREIGHT TRAIN is an up-tempo blues that is excellent; another blues on the CD is BIG PAUL, which at 14-minutes is just a tad too long. NEVER KNEW and LYRESTO, both taken medium-up, are also very good. Flanagan is his usual impeccable self. Excellent early work by all the musicians involved
1	Great This is a great compilation and theres not a bad track on it. To Heathcliff an earlier reviewer thers is a lot more to completing your Australian Triology than Midnight Oil, Men at Work and Inx have a look on Amazon at some of these other Australian acts-AC/DC,Little River Band,Air Supply,Cold Chisel,The Church,The Easybeats,Rose Tattoo,The Angels,Silverchair,Living End,Hoodo Gurus,Hunters And Collectors,Nick Cave
1	A personal favorite by Renaissance This 1975 release shows Renaissance at a peak and the excellent music on this album certainly reflects this - it is a personal favorite in fact. I really appreciate the craft that the band put into their music; not to mention the emotional sophistication and superb musicianship. This album is an especially fine example of these qualities. The music of Renaissance is very disciplined (I really appreciate this) for a rock band and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band. Keyboardist John Tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor pipe organ and harpsichord work, along with a string synthesizer - it is used effectively throughout the album and marks a point where John started using synthesizers more. Electric guitars are absent and Michael Dunford employs both strummed and picked parts on the acoustic guitar, which further emphasizes the classical approach. In fact, it is only John Camps virtuosic bass playing on a trebly Rickenbacker bass and to a much lesser extent, Terence Sullivan's drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions. To emphasize the classical "thing" even further, an orchestra is featured on this album, and this may very well be their most classically influenced record. Saving the best for last though, Annie Haslam has one of the most stunning altos I have heard - the delicate textures of her voice are both positive and uplifting. The pieces on Scheherazade include a single short track (The Vultures Fly High 3'04"), two pieces in the mid-length range (7'05" Ocean Gypsy and Trip to the Fair 10'51), and finally the massive multi-movement Scheherazade suite (24'37"). The suite is a very sophisticated piece of music and is extremely well-arranged; with dense ensemble work and breathtaking dynamics. The Scheherazade suite is incredible and my favorite composition by the band - I think it neatly sums up everything that I love about their music. In addition to the suite, there are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this album including the track Ocean Gypsy, although all of the other pieces are very strong. This remastered effort by Repertoire is not too bad at all and features great sound quality along with a brief band bio and a few photos. In summation, this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band (1973-1977) and is very highly recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music. If you like this recording, also check out Ashes are Burning (1973); Turn of the Cards (1975); and Novella (1977)
1	My Favorite Corea Album I bought this album after listening to an interview with Chick Corea on NPR over the summer last year. In the interview he was asked the quintessential question: "What is your favorite album that you've put out over the years?". His answer was this album. The album stands up to that testament. The emotion, energy, and talent of Chick and his band is incredible. Every time I listen to this album I hear something new. I'd give it 6 stars if I could
1	Ah, James.... James, you let me down, brother...I thought out of all the people in the world, you were gonna be the one that lived forever. I thought you were immortal, super-bad, and impervious to death. That's okay, man, I forgive you. You will continue to live on in my heart, my mind, and of course, in my soul with your great recordings. I know that wherever you are now, James, you are makin' it funky. Thank You for blessing my life...
0	At last!! At last! I can say that I know what a castrato being tortured with a power drill while an infinite number of monkeys scrape an infinite number of fingernails across an infinite number of blackboards sounds like. Thanks, Mandy
1	Hallelujah Jaleo! GYPSY SOUL is the wonderful follow-up disc to Narada's earlier release GYPSY PASSION. Together the two discs comprise two of the finest compilations of the "New Flamenco" style heard anywhere. If anything, GYPSY SOUL is even more eclectic than its predecessor, exhibiting the talents of New Flamenco stalwarts like Jesse Cook all the way across the spectrum to Slash of Guns 'n' Roses fame. Slash's contribution is a restrained, yet heady melodic instrumental which would stun most of his usual fan base. The disc shows all its contributors to be virtuosos, and the recording style (rather raw and untouched) brings out the earthy qualities of New Flamenco at its best.
0	Utter Garbage, Cheap Record Company Oh, I see... issue the original UK version with 4 songs, but leave off the U.S. version 5 or so songs? And you have plenty of room to fit them all (because the U.S. version clocks in at under 44 minutes, so adding 4 more tracks would have been a piece of cake)? Just more scumbag tactics from record companies reissuing CD's. Strummer is rolling in his grave. Just say no, and STOP BUYING the MUSIC from these scam record companies. If you must BUY USED, so they won't get your dough!
0	Waste of money Watch out for the volume leveling mentioned in another review. Surely the compliers could have come up with a better sort order than by composer. The change in tempo/volume between pieces makes it impossible to enjoy. My two CD's ended up in the trash. Ke
0	If you like classical music don't buy this CD. Most of the tracks were chopped down to 3-4 minutes so some of the best parts of the compositions are missing. I don't know what I was thinking trying to buy 40 classical songs on two CD's. If you really want to enjoy the music you would do better to purchase a CD with fewer, but better quality tracks
1	awesome funky jazz band, definetly check them out In the tradition of the meters, Galactic is presently putting out some incredible tunes. I listen to this whole CD and their other probably at least once a week, all the way through. I cant get enough. They are all extremely talented. You have to buy this CD to understand what I am talking about. It is not a boring CD at all. I recommend it even more if you like the Meters. Check it out
1	This album is truly a musical gift This album fell into my life by accident and I am glad it did. This album is a wonderful combination of wit/humor, earthiness, and tender moments. The lyrics combined with his rough and deep voice are wonderful. Not a word is wasted nor out of place. This album is a &quot;keeper.&quot
1	An 'Emotion' That Rings True Following her deserved breakthrough with her last album EVOLUTION, Martina McBride continues her flirtation with the pop side of country with EMOTION, in which she delves further into her own brand of immaculately produced country(pop), resulting in her least country album to date. Fortunately, not only does McBride have the voice to pull it off with ease, but the continuing transition she's made over her last couple of albums towards pop is achieved seamlessly(and not with the jarring, heavy-handed feel of Faith Hill's inferior and overblown BREATHE). Again, one of McBride's key strengths is her choice of material, which always manages to balance fun, somewhat lightweight tunes('I Love You') with strong, well-written material('Love's The Only House', 'This Uncivil War'). As is typical, her vocal work is first-rate, particularly on the sterling ballad 'There You Are', which she manages to salvage from being just another typical rumination on the wages of love. Faith and Shania should pay better attention--this is how first-rate pop is supposed to sound
1	One of their most underrated efforts Time And A Word (1970.) The second Yes album. INTRODUCTION: Yes first came onto the musical scene in 1969, with the release of their self-titled debut album. The collaboration between singer Jon Anderson and bass player Chris Squire showed serious potential with the release of that first album. Sadly though, it was overlooked by the music-loving public of the day. The band would make it big, but that would take a few more years. The band's 1970 sophomore album, Time And a Word, was equally overlooked, sadly enough. So, just how does the second album from the classic progressive rockers fare? Keep reading, and you shall see. OVERVIEW: -Time And A Word was released November of 1970. -The album was produced by Tony Colton. -The album's tracklist consists of No Opportunity Necessary No Experience Needed, Then, Everydays, Sweet Dreams, The Prophet, Clear Days, Astral Traveller, and Time And A Word. -The band on this album consisted of vocalist Jon Anderson, drummer Bill Bruford, bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and guitarist Peter Banks. The band here was unchanged from the debut album. This was Peter Banks' last album with Yes; he'd be replaced by Steve Howe for the band's next album. REVIEW: The two albums Yes did before Steve Howe joined the band are, without question, the most underrated works they ever did. It's a shame these albums get so overlooked, because they are nothing short of excellent. All eight tracks this album serves up are among the band's finest, and certainly among their most unique. I wasn't sure what to think of this album due to its somewhat mixed reputation, but one listen to it showed me that this was one of the finest progressive rock albums of its time. The songs on here sound nothing like anything the band had done prior or sense, meaning this is arguably the band's most unique-sounding album. These tunes are tough to describe and to put into words, but I'll do my best. The band kicks things off with one of my all-time favorite songs they ever did - No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed. The songs combines classical-style orchestration with the classic organ-heavy prog rock this version of Yes is noted for. A solid opener, indeed. And then we move on to the second track on the album, Then. The underrated Bill Bruford is the star of the show here - his rapid drumming in the verses simply must be heard to be appreciated. And Tony Kaye's keyboarding is excellent, too (it's a shame he gets overlooked in favor of the more popular Rick Wakeman most of the time.) Next up is Everydays, a cover of a Buffalo Springfield tune. Like most of the band's covers, the song itself stays true to the original, but it gets a total revamp with plenty of organ playing and extended instrumental portions. And believe it or not, I just might like this version of the song more than the original! And then we have Sweet Dreams. I've always like this tune, because it's somewhat of the happy medium between the band's early pre-Howe material and the more popular stuff that would come later. Another underrated Yes tune. Track five is The Prophet, one of the best songs on the album. The first half is instrumental, and Peter Banks and Tony Kaye beautifully demonstrate their musical abilities on their respective instruments (it's a shame these guys got so overlooked in favor of their successors.) Once again, the song implements elements of a classical-style, orchestral piece, and as a whole this makes the song better. Following that tune, we get to Clear Days, the sixth song on the album. This is a slow and melodic piece with a low-pitched violin backing Anderson's vocals. It's probably the most Baroque-sounding thing Yes ever did. It's a shame they didn't make this song longer and a little more developed, because it could have been a masterpiece. Still, it's very good the way it is. Seventh on this album is Astral Traveler. The song's sound is absolutely brilliant, featuring a sort of "space rock" sound that sounds like the band's later material, but at the same time it sounds totally different. Hard to describe this song, but it's a good one! Closing things out is the title track. This is a slow, melodic track with excellent backing instrumentation. It definitely brings the late Beatles sound to mind. Overall, this track makes for a damn good finisher. And in the end, Time And a Word stands as one of the band's underrated masterpieces. EDITION NOTES: In the early twenty-first century, the Yes catalogue got a much-needed reissuing. The new versions of the albums feature remastered sound, expanded liner notes, and bonus tracks. These new versions of the albums on CD kill older CD issues dead. If you don't have the albums yet, be sure you get the remastered ones! OVERALL: In the end, Yes proves that they had the ability to make excellent music from the very beginning. Who cares if it doesn't sound like the band that most people know and love? The music itself flat-out rules. It also goes to establish just how talented the underrated Tony Kaye and Peter Banks are - it's a shame their successors in Yes get all the credit from most fans. Oh, well. Final verdict? If you're new to Yes, you might want to start with The Yes Album or Fragile. This is a great album, no questions asked, although there are better starting points. That said, though, this is a solid album through and through, and it belongs in the collection of every Yes fan.
1	Unjustly Overlooked I was just telling my boss about this record today! To be honest with you, the first two Yes albums are better than the more bombastic and commercially-successful records which follow. The original band focused on short, intricately-arranged, pieces. Yes started out thinking "How beautiful and interesting a statement can we make?" and ended up thinking "How can we impress the audience with our musical cleverness?" These two records are often compared to the Beatles, but I think they also show the influence of "Odessey and Oracle"-era Zombies
0	The 2 stars are for the first and last songs on the album. This album begins with the great and classic song "Radar Love" and ends with the great and classic song "Twilight Zone." Between those two songs is one hour of forgettable, mediocre music. If you did not know better you would think that it was two different bands.
0	Legends... wit this.... i think not I like ATL i think there album Uncle Samz Curze is a underated classic. But LEGENDZ???? not a classic, not even mediocre, da beatz sound strained and da lyricz are tired. This only getz 2 starz cuz of da song Adventurez Of... easily the bezt cut on here, and one of da bezt of dere career. If u truly love ATL cop this, if u dont, find a way to get Adventurez Of... and leave this alone
0	Starts to go downhill at this point In my opinion, Hank Williams Jr. - when he did it right - was about as good as it gets in country music. You listen to his records like "Old Habits" and "Whiskey Bent & Hell Bound" and it is hard to get much better than that. But with this album Hank Jr started showing glimpses of what would become his future...and it's not good. He has a terrible version of "The Tennessee Stud" and everything just seems so overdone. He's best on songs like "I Don't Care If Tomorrow Never Comes", "Ramblin My Shoes" and "All My Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down" - everything else is just filler. And with future albums the filler would get worse until he eventually got to the point he would write things like "This Ain't Dallas" and "Fax Me a Beer". Too bad, terrible waste of talent.
0	One of Elvis' best Camden albums on CD for the first time!...but with a few changes... I always liked this LP, because it included some un-released studio and soundtrack recordings that had never been released before this LP first appeared in 1970. However, there have been a few slight changes in the CD version, which were kind of dissapointing. The song "Mama", which is an out-take from Elvis' movie "Girls! Girls! Girls!, is not the 2:12 mono version from the original LP...it is the 58 second, stereo version that was first included on the "Double Features" series. This shorter version was probably included because of the better sound quality and the fact that it is in stereo, although the actual reason is not quite clear. The shorter version is actually the original, the way Elvis actually recorded it. The longer version is spliced from Elvis' version and the Amigios version, which was probably done at the same session. This is the version that was used in the film, and Elvis probably liked it enough to record a version of his own...probably as a tribute to his mother. It is also possible that it was originally intended for the film, but never used. The other change here is with the song "Let's Forget About The Stars". The version included on the CD is the same take as the one on the original LP...however, the LP version included a piano track that is missing from the CD. Again, the CD includes the stereo version that was included on the "Double Features" series, probably because the original LP included the song in mono. It's possible that the master, which included the over-dubbed piano track, has been lost. Still, this CD is not a complete dissapointment, because the versions of these two songs included here are still very good. My only complaint would be that this version of "Mama" is much too short, and this LP only included 9 songs and had a short running time to begin with. These original Camden albums on CD are selling for only about 5.99, so at least they are not over priced, which makes them well worth purchasing. Still, anyone who has waited for this CD to get the versions of these two songs as they were released on the LP will be a bit dissapointed
0	ANDREWS SISTERS HAVE BETTER SONGS Maybe it's because I grew up listening to the ANDREWS SISTERS, but I really had a hard time enjoying this disc. This is the second compilation of Boswell Sisters I've tried, and again, they just don't do it for me. This disc sounded like the Andrews Sisters before they found their magical blend and the tunes themselves weren't very good either. It's not the Boswell Sisters fault, it's just that the great song writers (of the late thirties and early forties) were just around the corner. In my opinion, it seemed that 99% of the Andrews songs were GOOD, I felt that only a few on this disc were truly good. The arrangements were solid, but so were the Vic Schoen arrangements for the Andrews Sisters. Sure, if there were no Boswell Sisters then there would probably be no Andrews Sisters, but I recommend the Very Best of the Andrews Sisters (40 Greatest Hits) [IMPORT] first.
0	Should Be Called Poop Diddy Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene.
1	Music For the Morning After The Day I Forgot Putting in Pete's own words...It's Music For the Morning after the Day I Forgot. I'd say that sums it up. A great follow up. I perused a friend's copy of `Day I Forgot' on the way to Pete's House of Blues show in Cleveland in July. This is signature Pete Yorn. The disk is filled with obscure lyrics, wandering melodic twists, bizarre arrangements, unorthodox but brilliant production, and lots of guitar. I.E...Everything that should be expected in a Pete Yorn release. I was really glad I went to the show unfamiliar with this one. I really got turned onto some great new songs at the show. `All at Once' is the sleeping giant on this disc. An insightful and dark song about his father's failure to relate to those around him (I think). This album's `Closet' has got to be `Burrito' (coincidently also track 10). If you like Pete Yorn, you'll love this one. BUY IT. My copy's on the way. I might also urge you avoid saving a buck on a used one and to get a new copy (cast a vote). I don't mind buying used Garth Brooks discs, but Pete's still trying to claw his way up. We do want to see a third album.
0	Sorry to be a Scrooge... ...but it has to be said: While 'Martinis and Misteloe' is a swinging concept, it doesn't translate to a quality Christmas party-spirited cd -- in this case. From the first notes, and then the vocals, sadly it just never improves. However, negative reviews really should be accompanied by an alternative suggestion; here's mine: 'Ultra-Lounge: Christmas Cocktails, Part One'
1	GREAT TURNTABLISM This is the best effort put together by these boys.The album has a steady pace that never gets odd like alot of turntable albums out there.I have alot of these types of albums and this one is one of the best.Great emcees grace the album here and there and the beats stay raw and the scratching sounds unrehearsed to give it a basement sound.I would not put my name on here recommending junk.THIS IS HIP HOP.In its purest form.All of my recommendations will satisfy the hardcore.50 CENT FANS DONT EVEN CHECK.MY LIST WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU
0	A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT I have been a big fan of New Found Glory since "All Downhill From Here" came out. I bought Catalyst and loved it, so I bought all their old albums, loved them all too. I found out New Found Glory had a new cd coming out.....couldnt wait. So i go out and buy this cd the day it came out, I was that excited, I brought it home thinking "all right, this will be awesome!!!" Over the next 40-some minutes I experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life. Every song was a ballad, there were no fun songs like "Hit or Miss" "Forget My Name" "The Great Houdini" "Your Biggest Mistake" or even an amazingly well written song like "No News Is Good News." I basically got a whole cd of "I Don't Wanna Know" which in my mind was New Found Glory's worst song to date. I listened to this cd once, and I barely made it through to the end and when it was over, I seriously considered throwing it in the trash. This band has died, after all those years of fun and great songs, they have been destroyed. I will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so I can enjoy their old albums again
1	Lo fi go Hi fi Pavement's last album(or arguably Malkmus' first solo record)sees them embrace a fuller,more streamlined sound that surprisingly (since their initial charm was their roughness)works in their advantage giving Malkmus' songwriting a more refined tone and enhancing the band's challenging musical detours. It's no "Crooked Rain,Crooked Rain" but "Terror Twilight" ends the group's run in an undeniable high(Carrot Rope,Spit on a Stranger and Cream of Gold are already among their classics)and it also gave very positive clues of what Stephen Malkmus' solo career would sound like.
1	GOOD SONGS AND VALUE this cd has a good sound and variety of their greatest hits. you must be a drifter's fan to enjoy this one.
1	epic crushing groove devestation...!!! by the time that you get too the 2nd track on 'the red sea'it is too late.. you are quickly subjected to unmercyful desolet fury...i can not express enough, the hoplessness, and desperic rage that this song displays!!!the vocals are so incredible it sends me into a barbaric slam groove frenzy every time i hear it..this song has the most pummeling crushing spiteful slamming hatered filled breakdowns of any band in the scene..long live sludge cruch slam groove hatered..!!!i rate this album 100 stars!!!!
0	I cannot stand this guy at all He has no real talent at all. He cannot rap, he has no flow, no lyrics, the beats can make you fall asleep. In short, this is the reason why rap music is so bad nowadays
1	this cd is awesome!!!!!!!! i love scandal!!!! i have previously purchased the cd scandalous which at the time was the only way to find most of the material from their EP. that cd contains 4out of 5 songs. so it was a good collection. Then i purchased Patty Smyth's greatest hits featuring scandal because i was trying to get the rest of the group's material. while it is also a great cd and contains alot of their material ,it still left you wanted more. Now we have it! This cd is awesome. not only do you get all 5 songs from the EP but 4 never released tracks. I have to agree with the other reviewer, why didn't columbia just release all 9 songs and make a full LP?,and yes it would have been wonderful if they would have just put the rest of the warrior material on this release and completed the scandal collection they are all great. this is a real treasure. I also own The Warrior Cd. NOw all i need to complete my collection of Scandal/Patty Smyth is to purchase her 1987 self-titled solo album, which currently at amazon runs at about $25. i guess that isn't bad considering what a rarity that album is. highly recommend this to anyone who is a scandal fan!!! even if you own other scandal or Patty smyth CDs you will not have these 4 unreleased tracks. it is a must have!!
1	Above the Rest I think that Mario Frangoulis is better than Josh Groban or Andrea Bocelli. His range is fantastic and his voice is so pure that it just speaks to your soul. He is reminiscent of the three great tenors, Carreras, Domingo and Pavrotti. He is the best of both worlds...pop and opera. Bravo Mario
0	An opera rip-off does not make you a great singer... I was distressed and disgusted with "Sometimes I Dream" being a rip-off of "E lucevan le stelle", from Tosca. He's not the singer for me....and his cover of "Nights in White Satin" was very ho-hum. Justin Hayward should have stayed with the Moody Blues for that one
1	No Masterpiece But Still A Good Album Released in 1997. "Be Here Now" was Oasis third album and their last near great. At the time of it's release Oasis was among the most popular rock bands and whatever they made was turned into gold. There was no exception with "Be Here Now" that proves the bands craftmanship and lives up to the hype surroundig them. At first listen I thought that the album was a little overproduced with too much commercial appeal but the album is aging well and looking back at it now, I believe that "Be Here Now" is an very strong album. Afterall it was their last that sold really well all over the world and gave them several big single hits. The music is far from surprising, if you liked their first 2 albums and Noel's songwriting you will enjoy this one aswell. I think some songs were a little too commercial, but on the other hand it got loads of energic rockers too and it shows the bands diversity and craftmanship. "Do You Know What I Mean" is super long with it's 7.42. It was also a pretty big hit in Europe but at the same time it also suffers from being too long and overproduced. Oasis had always done simple songs but for the first time on "Be Here Now" their success had gone to their heads, it feels forced with it's lenght, sound effects and solo's. Having said that, it's not a bad song but not what we wer used to. "My Big Mouth" is a classic rocker, that would have been great for their debut album. "Magic Pie" is also too lon with 7 minutes, it's a midtempo that Noel sings. "Stand By Me" was a hi single, and a quite typical Oasis song, midtempo, good chorus and good sing-a-long. It's defenitely one of the better songs on this album. "I Hope, I Think, I Know" is yet another rocker. "The Girl In The Dirty Shirt" is surprisingly good eventhough it was never a single release. A poppy midtempo. "Fade In Out" is half-acccoustic with little instruments used and a soewhat bluesy sound, although it doesn't stand out at all. "Don't Go Away" is a ballad, and one of their best songs. The song is about losing someone that stand close to you, unfortunately it was only releases as a single in Japan. "Be Here Now" the title track is another trademark midtempo rocker. "All Around the World" that also was a single-release suffers from the same thing as the opener. It's too long with 9 minutes, it's overproduced (just look at the music video) and it's also too commercial. Sure, neither this one is bad at all, it good a meliodic chorus and has got a wonderful beatleesque ending with sing-a-long and heavy guitars, but it was a little too much. "It's Getting Better" a rocker and a reprise of "All Around the World" closes the album. Overall, Oasis last near great album. Even if it got it's faults and is weaker then the first 2 albums, it got it's moments with both rockers, midtempo pop/rock and one very good ballad. The main problem is that some songs are too long. The whole album clocks at 70 minutes and was 25 minutes longer then the average Oasis album. At times it's just becoming too much and it feels like Oasis success has gone over their heads and were trying to be something they weren't at times, but needless to say, It is a good album with a fair share of good songs and looking back at it now it brings back memories when Oasis were at their peak and rules the charts. 4/5 stars. Good Purchase
1	Somewhat helpful Rivka Simmons' voice is very soothing and encouraging, but her "meditations" have been only so-so helpful in easing my "stress". Track 4, "Body Scan Relaxation" continues to leave me baffled. (*How* am I supposed to "breathe" from my feet?) Track 3, "Progressive Muscle Relaxation" has been more helpful
0	&quot;growing away from me&quot; is lousy quality recording don't buy this cd for &quot;growing away from me&quot; as the recording sounds like it was burned from an old album, lots of pops and crackling. surely they could have found a better source tape or cleaned it up
1	This is the greatest cd ever. The music in this cd is amazing. You should buy it
1	JohnnyLongStreet It is true that this is a great collection of songs. With that said, here are two complaints: 1) The audio snippets from the movie are built into the tracks, so they're tougher to skip through. 2) The audio transfer is terrible. Somewhere in the process, either at the transfer or the mix, the audio thinned out. There's a really weak bass end, and everything sounds thin and tinny. Not that it ruins the experience, but for someone who's actually into how music sounds, you might look elsewhere
1	Better than Original... Ever since I played Final Fantasy IX, I've wanted to buy a soundtrack of it. I thought of buying the Original Soundtrack, but it cost more than $25, and i didn't have that much money. So I decided on this CD and it was worth it. Most of the songs on this CD are even better than the originals, and I wasn't going to listen to most of the songs on the original so... It's worth every penny
1	Awesome cd This cd by the best duo of our time do it again & there harmony i& playing of there guitars is just awesome. Id go out & buy this cd right away. George
0	Suicide At a time when fine music is fighting for its life, Haroncourt delivers this. The sound is crystalline. Every voice is heard. The performance is dead, dead, dead. For the good of music, Harononcourt should remove the key that winds his clockwork heart and throw it away. This is the most lifeless performance of the Mozart Requiem on disk. Many more like this and classical music will be dead--it can take only so many defeats
0	Another good band falls victum of modern day emo crap. I'm going to be straight up, the title says it all. Thrice was a great band, Illusion of Safety is one of the most incredable albums ever. Now they sound like every other band out there today. Personally I Hate emo, I grew out of that crap along time ago. I'm sorry if I offend people in saying that. I just dont see any talent in it. Thrice used to be my favorite band. Being a guitarist myself, I enjoyed Identity Crisis' true hardcore sound, and Illusion of Safety's amazing creativity, but the Artist in the Ambulance and this new CD are crap. If your emo, then give it a shot, but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you can't avoid every time you turn on the radio, put this album back. It's time to move on Thrice fans. They came.. they rocked.. there done
1	A Woodstocker Wanna Be When I saw this movie, I just knew I had to get this soundtrack. Music is from two genres of the time: the clean- housewifey-music, and the hippie-Woodstock music, to reflect Pearl's and Walker's backgrounds, respectively. I have to say, though, that whoever thought to keep Richie Havens' &quot;Freedom&quot; off the soundtrack made a poor decision. I made another copy of the cd and added the song myself by downloading it from the web. I now feel it is complete and I have it on continuous play on my surround sound, staring at my lava lamp and wishing for the first time in my life that I were older so that I could have been a part of this great era of music
1	Engelbert is the &quot;ALL TIME BEST&quot;! I've been an Engelbert Fan for years! &quot;THE WAY IT USED TO BE&quot; became a favorite of mine when it was first released and has remained a special favorite for all these years. I said back then he was the best! He's still around after over 30 years, doing tremendously fabulous wonderful concerts and new recordings! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY--ENGELBERT'S THE GREATEST
1	Can lead to even better things Well if you have missed some of the efforts linked to the modern Brazil music scene than this puts a nice sampler together for you. If you are already familiar and have come by way of the late Suba's &quot;Sao Paolo Confessions&quot; or Bebel Gilberto's lovely &quot;Tanto Tiempo,&quot; both so good that they deserved tributes or remixes, than you will be plesantly surprised by some of the other offerings. The problem with samplers is that they are just that, samples. Just when you are getting into a particular artist the track is over and you are suddenly listening to another one. The good news is that this can lead you out to purchase a full CD of the artists music. Such was the case for me with Zuco 103. I found there sound sound inviting and when I purchased one disc I had even had to have another! The version they perform of &quot;Outro Lado&quot; is sweet, slightly funky, dreamy, trippy and like many of the tracks on this sampler, seductive. Zuco 103 also performs &quot;Treasure&quot; which is a bit more uptempo, bilingual(with interspersed English chorus) slightly edgy with a sprinkling of bossadelia that is not as good as the version featured on their CD but still very nice. Trio Mocoto's &quot;Os Orixas&quot; has a more carnival or futbol flavor where you can imagine the samba line grooving along . Bossacucanova fills in the dance lines on this sampler with jazz melodies for some soflty swinging atmospheric approches to create lounge Brazinujazz. All the songs contribute something tasty to the CD and is recommended for a point of departure or to just sit and watch your own Rio sunsets
0	He wasn't made for dancing ... or singing After reading several of the top rated reviewers here, I think it's time someone outside his family, or the people who work at his record company, had a say. This album is complete tripe. He can't sing or dance. Still, he blows David Hasslehoff out of the water at least
0	"THE MILLION DOLLAR FACE" TOO BAD HE CAN'T SING AS GOOD AS HE LOOKS. THEY SAY BETTY GRABLE HAD THE MILLION DOLLAR LEGS. HE HAS THE MILLION DOLLAR FACE [CIRCA: THE 70'S].

0	Buyer beware There's nothing wrong with the performance: it's Gershwin himself, according to the editorial review, taken from a piano roll. "Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality" it says on the packaging. All I can say is, it's a thin excuse for a surround-sound DVD-Audio disc: the one track is the only thing on it. Maybe 15 minutes, total, though nowhere on the disc or its packaging does it mention the track list or the timing. Or that it's remastered from a piano roll, for that matter. And all at a premium price? You've got to be kidding! Watch out for the entire DVD-Audio series by Alexander Goldberg Jero. I bought several, to fill out my DVD-Audio collection, and none have lived up to expectations
0	the unseen did a whoops on this one i do enjoy the first ep's and the albums from these guys, however, this cd kinda landed way off the mark. The greatness of the past cds were the energy along with the catchy street punk sing-a-long songs. On this album the unseend didnt seem to give it much time and effort. Even a new version of one of there old songs couldnt save this from being a flop. sorry guy
1	Probably the Best CD I own I bought this CD based on the movie sound track and have discovered that it is probably one of the best banjo CD's out there. I highly recommend this CD for anyone even remotely interested in banjo music
1	the first live release This is a very good album. The only reason I didn't give this version a five is because of the ommission of Bob's voice at the end of Lovelight. Get the original cd that still has Weir singing at the end of Lovelight
0	STORYVILLE FOLLOWUP Leans towards the blues side.Heartfelt vocals.Lacking licking licks.Less driving than their debut
1	Sass, where are you? This girl rocks! Her group is tight. She must be one hell of a live act. But... where's the follow-up CD? Everytime I go to a record store... 'cuse me, music store, I look for new Sass Jordan - it ain't there. Hope she's OK...
1	best ever My husband bought this for me 10 years ago and I wore it out. I absolutely love it. Luckily he was able to find me another copy. I would buy more if I could find them
1	great song that's not on the soundtrack just in case any of you guys were wondering what the song is that's playing during one of the strip club scenes with method man, it's called &quot;Bam Bam&quot; by Sister Nancy
1	Lady Of The Spice Lands This is a great acoustic guitar record. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys acoustic guitar finely played. The pieces are varied and focus on exquisite flowing melodic ideas. Chris Brenne's formidable technique does not overpower the beautiful intricacies of his compositional ideas, but instead serves the demands of each piece. The result is a record that has an integrity that attends to musicality first and foremost - sensitive, serene and strong playing
0	I'M SORRY BUT THIS CD DOESN'T EVEN MERIT ONE STAR I really like Reba but she messed up so big on this CD that its pitiful. Someone get me some Excedrin Migraine tablets please!! I was nauseous after hearing this mess.
0	Missing The song that ends the movie or is &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. THAT is worth getting. Does anyone know what the other songs with singing are
1	JACI WELL HERE I AM AGAIN BEST,BETTER,BUENO WHAT COULD I SAY
1	Country singer Vince uses orchestra for Christmas album Vince, with is high tenor voice, is one of the finest singers that country music has ever poroduced - however, this album is not a country album. It is a wonderful Christmas album that should appeal to fans of easy-listening music by the likes of Andy Williams and others. This was Vince's second Christmas album and (like the first) Vince sticks mainly to famous songs, being careful to avoid those that he included on his earlier album (Let there be peace on earth). The only unusual songs here are the title track (written by Amy Grant, who eventually married him and who has recorded three brilliant Christmas albums of her own), It's the most wonderful time of the year (which doesn't appear on Christmas albums as often as it deserves) and A cradle in Bethlehem (another excellent song that could do with greater exposure). Vince is in superb voice throughout with the orchestra providing tasteful backing on every track. So, once you get over any initial surprise at hearing Vince supported by an orchestra instead of Nashville musicians, this album is exactly what you'd expect - brilliant
1	Thrash music done right There is a lot of screaming headbanging music out there. It is hard to sort them out. Bury your dead delivers brutal riffs with great growling vocals. If you like music with punch, this one is for you. I would love to see these guys with throwdown. Yikes
1	Mediocre For Slayer, But An Excellent Piece Of Metal Nonetheless I think it's quite obvious at this point that Slayer is an unstoppable machine of headbanging bliss that has little chance of losing its massive fanbase. They've come to be loved for their uncomprimisingly brutal take on thrash metal and the fact that they stick to their guns like no other band. Even when a hint of change is detected in their work, it's still Slayer and it's still satisfying. This strength is especially apparent with Diabolus In Musica. Slayer has been going at it for over twenty years, and most of their songs have followed a strict code of conduct -- namely the speed. Some people complain that DIM leaves this aspect of Slayer's talent behind. Not so. It only reduces the amount of it -- and what's so bad about that? The trademark thrashing style is still found here, only it's accompanied by more of the slower, brooding riffs and drum work that, in earlier releases, didn't really dominate. Does slower mean less heavy? Absolutely not. I think it actually helps the music and gives it a darker feel. Not to mention makes the faster parts even more pronounced. For one thing, the myth of "slower equals boring" is clearly busted throughout the album. As far as the music and song structure goes, I didn't think it sounded like "filler" material at all. These are classics in their own right. You can't expect Reign In Blood or other definitive Slayer albums to be surpassed, and I think the band is well aware of that. The riffs are still heavy, mean, and at times -- in a completely non-melodic way -- even catchy. The lyrics and vocal work are also a nice touch. With DIM, Araya is leaning more toward the shouting style that would later take on practically every line in God Hates Us All. A little more like a mix, though, between the old and new. The only low points in the singing were the breathy, moaning tones he used sometimes (thank goodness this usage was rare). It reminded me of Marilyn Manson or even some of these numetal bands. But by all means, contrary to common criticism, DIM is far beyond numetal. As mentioned before, it's still obvious Slayer material, just a bit evolved. Luckily, the lyrics stay firmly planted in that moody, anti-religious, almost poetic atmosphere Slayer has always had. And as for the whole "get Lombardo back on drums" deal, I didn't find Bostaphs's playing to be a problem at all. He adds his own taste in there, with some pretty good double bass throughout the album. So for those thinking that the absence of Lombardo might kill the mood, don't worry. The whole band delivers the goods as usual. Then again, how could they not? Diabolus In Musica is a pleasant surprise. While it is easily overshadowed by the Slayer "classics", it stills lives up to the legendary band. It never falls off the line of hard'n'heavy mayhem that fans love, yet manages to give a little bit of an alternative approach at the same time. No matter the differences, it is a fine piece of metal and belongs in every Slayer fan's collection

1	i dont dig on sountracks.... But I bought this one. Couldn't help it. The music was such a prominent part of the film, more so than any other film I've seen. It was a good film, ok. I'm not in love with it. But the music was in tune with the great parts of the film- never ever witnessed this before. Witness: Samuel Jackson slipping on the gloves and coldly assasinating Chris Tucker. Could that song, don't even know what it's called, be more shocking, fitting, pretty much every adjective. And then the end of the flick with Jackie driving with a tear in her eye singing along- I do the same thing without the tear. Truth told I didn't know much about this music before I saw the movie. But it makes me feel like I was there and that makes my life more exciting and that makes a good album. Pulp fiction OST was really good too but to put it straight up, Jackie Brown is black soul that white boys don't get the pleasure to hear. Boo-yah!
1	EL CORAZON This recording will ground you to the earth, reconnect you with the soil you came from. There are many fine, beautiful compositions here. I listen to them while bathing, along with the music I use oils, incense and candles, it is a preparatory ritual. The beginning vocal track &quot;Omiya&quot; is an uplifting spiritual piece from the heart. Another fabulous composition is &quot;Red Hibiscus on Skin&quot; a soft synth track with flute and other instrumentation. &quot;Biki Is Insulted&quot; is a heavy drum laden warrior piece with accompanying vocals which sound similar to a tribal chorus. &quot;A Cry From The Heart&quot; is a somber and compelling layered male vocal piece complete with deep space atmosphere, it is the introspective 'dark night of the soul' experience. I must add that it was quite some time until I actually appreciated the majority of KAMA SUTRA. You may have to let it sink in also. When you are sinking into your hot bath water allowing your heavy oils to penetrate your senses, it will happen. It is most proper to use oils that correlate well with this recording, such as sandalwood, patchouli or Dr. Singha's Mustard Bath (I use this product). Enjoy this life-altering music
1	Post bop heaven A refreshing original melange of contemporary sax. If you are always on the hunt for new hard bop sounds, Chris Potter is turning out cutting edge compositions and blowing way the critics. I just saw his quartet in Montreal play to three standing ovation encores. Dont miss this album, surely to be among the best of the yea
1	Live Concert Versions of Bon Jovi's Greatest Hits "One Wild Night: Live 1985-2001" by Bon Jovi, Is a compilation of Bon Jovi's best songs, performed at various concert events from 1985 to 2001. For Bon Jovi fans, it's classic Bob Jovi and a Must Have! If you like music recorded from "Live" performances, You will love this album! If you prefer "Studio-Cut" versions, you may not like this album because it has the sound and feel of a live concert.
0	Thanks J. Darwin Great list with original artists. I can't believe they are selling the soundtrack with remakes. Looks like I'm off to iTunes to see if I can find all these songs. Thanks again
0	where's the others? My Wife got Me this soundtrack a few years ago and I took it straight back. The problem is it's missing about 50 songs that were in the movie, and the B.o.c. song Godzilla (from the album Spectres) is NOT sung by B.O.C. If all songs were included this would be the coolest soundtrack ever, but it's not
0	Agree. Not as good as the original. Every soundtrack sounds like the previous one because of slow, ponderous, heavy, sterile, dry interpretation of the themes. One just expects some brightness in the playing but this is never delivered. This recording &quot;tries&quot; to have a story. Stick to the original soundtrack. 1000 times more enjoyable
1	I pledge Allegiance to Firewind Allegiance is masterpiece of music and metal, seamlessly woven together in gigantic proportions. Firewind has produced a classic album in the midst of a revival of metal. I'm a child of the 80's, when metal ruled the world. I have never been so excited as bands like Dream Evil, DragonForce, Hammerfall and more bring back metal to the forefront. Firewind breathes some fresh air into the once dying beast of heavy metal. Crisp, clear and powerfully vibrant vocals, extremely intricate and heavy guitar work, bass guitars that won't stop all synchronized with awesome drumming(complete with double bass drums!) At times the vocals sounds like a blend of anything Jorn Lande has done mixed with a touch of David Coverdale of Whitesnake fame. I just can't stop listening to the song called "Breaking the Silence"! If you love metal, old or new, this is a must have for any true metalhead
1	One rare and great CD I just love it. It's my second Villegas after Cafe Ole and I like it better than the first one. Vocals are intriguing - they lack the professional training and quality and that is what makes them refreshing. I consider it money well spent. I don't have musical training - I am a non-Latino male who is into Latin music
0	5 stars? You're kidding!! This is easily the worst Sinatra/Riddle/Capitol record and I'm not surprised it's been unavailable for years.Sinatra wanted to record something with the Hollywood String Quartet and this is the result. He's in wonderful voice, but the material stinks and Riddle's scores are painfully dragging. He simply doesn't have enough musicians on these dates and the strings are headache inducing."Blame It On My Youth" is the standout, but you can keep the rest. The emperor has no clothes on this one
0	Another record company made band. Numetal that's all. So many of these bands sound the same I think they should all just have the same name. How about The Sell Outs, or perhaps The Posers or maybe The Pretenders (oops that one is taken by a GOOD band already). That way, no one would have to pretend they have just discovered the one new band that doesn't really sound like the rest and isn't in it just for the quick money and quick fame. C'mon folks. Get real. These guys are just another nu metal band that won't be around in a year or two and I along with legions of others can't wait till this genre of music is gone and dead like disco. Temporary amusement for party background music while you talk with your pre high school friends and tell each other how cool this "new" band is, maybe. Quality rock music with soul, talent and heart, hardly
1	Old School Love One of the best of original old school, I wish more of today,s music had the same demeaner as a lot of the eighties music, because a lot of todays music have the same sound. Give me old school anyday
0	I wish there was a lower ranking Pink sucks. This is a horrible CD and horrible albunm art work. They gave her too much freedom on this CD since Mizzunderstood was a big hit. That is probably why her new song Stupid Girls is so catchy and sing-songy it makes me want to puke as well. But I guarantee they didnt let this wanna be riot grrrl go all hard core again. If they did, this new disc is bound to wind up in the .99 bin along with Try This.
0	You guys are crazy What the hell is up with all these 5 star ratings?? Man. Meat Puppets 2 deserves 5 but this one? Up on the Sun is full of lame guitar licks, annoying whistling, chanting, wtf?? MP 2 is like a piece of art while this one is more like a piece of crap, sorry guys
0	an embarrasment I remember when this came out and as a guitar player myself, I was highly intrigued with the names involved on this project. My initial impression of April Lawton was to hang up my guitar and forget the whole thing (she is/was a damn good guitar player). Afterwords I realized that this album is quite an embarrasment. Their next release, the more acoustic In April Came the Dawning of the Red Suns is a MUCH better effort.
0	A Kids Review on there Mother's Name I'm on my Mom's Amazon Account just to say my review for this CD. I don't have it, but I have all the songs on my Ipod that I like from it. Here's my ratings- Go The Distance- This freakin rocked so much. It's so emotional and beautiful! Color's Of The Wind- Techno sounds, love it! Find yourself- great. Two worlds- Nice. Part Of Your World- Liked the beat. Kiss The Girl- I love this Pop Rendition! True to your heart- cool. blah blah blah. I can't remember the rest only because I don't really like the rest so over all this CD was amazing!!!!!
1	This album has all the &quot;hoo-bangin&quot; hits of the 9-8 Big Pun, Busta, Snoop... all the artists who had the hit songs out that you could only get by buying their album have now been put on one cd. At this price, it's a straight up deal
0	what a putz i heard this fruitcake justin was saying how lame and boring virginia beach was. well he's from memphis, tennessee. u can't get much wacker than that. what did he grow up on a farm or something? redneck. sounds lame to m
0	Iowa STATE? Any album that lists the "Iowa Fight Song" followed by (Iowa State) can't be any good. It's the University of Iowa Fight Song, not Iowa State University. And from the preview I heard, they didn't do it justice anyway
1	Night Song To be sure raw music is the best but this album is a sweet mix of voice and technology..and always makes me cry especially "my heart my love"..nusrat had a great gift from the Big Boss upstairs..miss him very much
1	Suzi at her Best &quot;This is a quite a different compliation to most of the other Suzi Quatro compliations, this has not just been thrown together. It defines Suzi and her music just that bit better
0	Driver's Seat Where the heck is Sniff n' The Tears' "Driver's Seat" in this soundtrack. It plays at a definite changing point in the movie where Floyd comes to tell Jack that he needs to switch to video instead of film. It's a travesty that this song wasn't included. But a good soundtrack nonetheles
0	o my word great! jus wat hip hop needs, another idiot comin up talkin bout cars n money. its no wonder nas sez hip hop is dead. unless the real mcs stand up soon, hip hop has no hop
0	A Disco Christmas - ACK! I LOVE Christmas. I love the festive atmosphere. I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music. This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to. A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more "upbeat" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than "a disco Christmas" and severely test my love for the music of the season. Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere
0	MISLEADING TITLE It would have been better to label it "Best of Mannheim Steamroller Christmas" than this misleading title. It is just a rehash of selections from their previous albums; all of which I already have so this was a waste of $14 cause stores won't take back OPENed CD's. (anybody got a shrinkwrap machine handy??)
1	Preview your wedding day This CD was inexpensive, and provided a great way to preview songs for my wedding. The CD had a good song selection. My fiance and I were able to get a better idea of how the songs would be at our wedding. Definitely an inexpensive tool that is worthwhile
0	Buyer Beware Huge Camouflage fan! So, needless to say, I was very excited to learn that there was a best of cd/dvd compination available. I have been into the group from the very beginning, but unfortunately, had never seen many of their videos. Thanks MTV. Anyway, I ordered Rewind-The Best of 95-87 to catch up on all the videos that I had never seen. I received the disc and promptly placed it into my dvd player (Panasonic). It would not play the disc, "unable to read format". OK, I tried my second dvd/vcr combo, it will play anything.....no, not this time. "Format: Unrecognizable". I tried the disc on three other players (Samsung, Hitachi, and a portable Sony), all to no avail. I finally placed it in my iMac, my last hope. It said that it would not read as a dvd, but it could play it in another format. Meaning, it will play the disc, but as a computer image, not as a true dvd. The picture was very small and quite grainy. So I still got to see the videos, but not in the format that I had hoped. I just wanted to pass this information on to other fans of the band. It is a risky purchase, and a pricey one at that
0	"Try This" - Please Do Not Try This! I used to be a big Pink's fan. I loved her first CD. It was the only CD I listened to for 5 months straight. Then, her second CD came out. It was a big disappointment. Something in her style changed, which I did not like. But I still faithfully purchased this CD, hoping that she would put out some good music. But I seriously regretted buying the CD. I guess now Pink is famous, she gets to decide what direction she wants her music to go. Obviously, she is always been a punk rock chic deep down inside. Now I realized that the style in her first CD wasn't really who she was. It was just something that her record company put her in so that she could be accepted by the general mass. Now Pink has millsions of faithful fans, she can care less about being accpeted. She takes off her mask and we see this rocker girl. Some people love her more, some people like her less. I belong to the latter group. The music in this CD is mostly rock with a little bit pop beat. If that's what you like, buy this CD. Purple_Garde
1	Better than... Whut? Thee Album was better than any Solo effort from E-double. It hurts me to admit that becuase I am a huge fan of erick sermon, but I have to say it. I consider Reggie on the TOP TEN LIST. He (in my opinion) is one of Hip Hops Finest Lyricists!!! Everything about this record was good. His creativitly & humor, hardcore raps, etc. You all really should include this in your next purchase. High Quality Hip Hop Material, NO FILLER what-so-ever. A
0	Save Your Money The songs were cut to pieces to fit them on the CD. Don't bother, the great stuff was just ruined
1	Music to drink codeine cough syrup by. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine have done the obvious, obviously. While not strictly as bad as William (Bill) Murry's obnoxious lounge act, nor as over-the-top as the late Andy Kaufman's Tony Clifton persona, `Richard Cheese' keeps his performance within the character's velvet rope guidelines, and instead minimizes and only slightly deconstructs the classic lounge song. This is neither Sinatra nor Bennet, nor is it your little brother doing a bad imitation of them. This is serious lounge, yet alternative. Like waking from a familiar dream, Richard Cheese's renditions are still recognizable, yet obviously something "other", and yet as pure as the originals. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against The Machine, therefore, are not tribute creators in another style, like Dred Zepplin, for they are members of their genre. They also are not a joke on the genre within the genre, as was the lamented "Nig Heist" within the touring "Black Flag" shows of the early 80s. Neither do they make `lounge' more `lounge' with overproduction, digital techniques, and rich strings. Indeed, minimalism and limited range are the bywords. Or perhaps it is driven by a small production budget. And the obvious question must be answered: is Richard Cheese "Cheesy?" Only in the sophomoric dimensions of a joke as obvious as a goiter, where we cry out "Dick Cheese!" in the same breath that we call "Mike Hunt!" over a smoky crowd of strapless cocktail dresses, and elicit a few titters. Cheesy, yes, but the music does compel repeated listening, like Alex Chilton covering "More" with Bobby Darrin's shade speaking through the whisky, there is something there, there. But Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine are not cocktail classics to spin when you have the smoking jacket on and the new recruits from the secretary pool dropping by your place after the show, for this lounge set speaks more to the `cocktails made with codeine' set of cool. And yes, I am dying to know what Sir-Mix-A-Lot thinks of this version of "Baby Got Back.
1	The Best Slack Key Collection? It could be. I have a pretty extensive collection of slack key CDs, and this is my favorite. Without it, I may have never heard Ozzie Kotani or Moses Kahumoku. It's beautifully recorded, the liner notes are well written, plus they give all the tunings
1	Testify. Toward the end there is some weaker filler-type material, but for the most part this CD contains all the soul you'd ever need or want. &quot;Hold On I'm-a-Comin'&quot; is perhaps the greatest single soul statement out there, and there are a half-dozen other essential tracks contained on this disc. My favorite: &quot;I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down,&quot; the ultimate picture of a man beaten who wishes to rise up again... but cannot. This is, of course, a love song. What isn't
1	Excellent children's intro to Spanish This is a standard play in our home. My kids LOVE the way the character's repeat each Spanish sentence after Luis, Bob, Maria and the Muppets. The songs are catchy and infectious. We love to listen to this one in the afternoon, and after a lively session of sing along and dancing, it's off for naptime! Buy the video too, it's fun and festive and will give your little ones a taste of Spanish culture. A must have for every Elmo and Sesame Street fan
0	melanie c rocks she has made a good albums and this one wasnt that better than emmas albums or victorias.shes my favorite spice but after the 90s is started to like all of them really.she was nice and brave i dont know as shes doing now tho without the spice girls beacuase when shed perform with them shed bring the word spice into spice girls. there is alot of rock music in this album too! it would make a reat spice girls collection or melanie c fan collection so buy it!
1	Beautiful this cd is wondeful. some of his best work. if you are a fan, this is a must buy
0	Watch out! Be aware that this CD is INSTRUMENTAL ONLY! If you are looking for traditional hymns, this is the &quot;lite&quot; version. Sounds like muzak
0	Hope you like instrumentals! I bought this album expecting songs to sing with the kids. The music is probably great, but I have not yet gotten past the disappointment of so few sing alongs
1	The start of something good This is Trisha Yearwood's self titled debut album. The album was produced by Garth Fundis, who she has worked with many times. There's a collaboration with Garth Brooks, top songwriters, what more do you need? Yearwood is one of my favorite female country singers, because she sings better than most of her peers. Her voice is very good at emoting, she can go from a whisper to a scream in a second FLAT. She really makes you feel what she is singing. There was some big hits from this album including the classic &quot;She's In Love With The Boy&quot;, the ballad &quot;The Woman Before Me&quot;, the uptempo &quot;That's What I Like About You&quot; and the ballad with Garth Brooks singing backup titled &quot;Like We Never Had A Broken Heart&quot;. Other highlights include &quot;The Whisper Of Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Fools Like Me&quot; and &quot;Victim Of The Game&quot;. Overall a strong debut
0	save your money I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song
0	BOOOOOOOOO This CD stinks. It's got the worst music. The only good song is &quot;This is How We Do It&quot;.Don't buy it
0	A terrible waste of money I bought this album thinking it would be good, because every review I read gave it 5 stars. SO I thought "Why not?" and bought it. I put it in the cd player, and was immediately dissapointed. The first thing I noticed was how terrible the sound levels were. It sounds like it was recorded in my garage, everything is way over-saturated and the drums are mic'd terribly. You can't even tell what's going on half the time, which isn't saying much, because there is nothing very interesting happening in the guitars. So I listened a little longer, thinking "it has to get better, maybe they'll add some symphonic stuff or something, considering this was reviewed to be some sort of black metal masterpiece." I was wrong of course, as the first track remained pretty stagnant, as did the next, and the next track etc. assumed that the frontman MUST be a good singer, considering his howl is absolutely laughable. Once again, bad sound levels come in to play here, even though not a whole lot could cover up how terrible this dude is. Basically this album is not the black metal masterpiece it was hyped up to be. If you are into really bad prog metal with bad production, this album is for you. If you're not, steer clear of this album. it was the biggest waste of money I made this year
1	Powerful and expressive singing with an amazing technique and control Considering Netrebko's and Villazon's age- both are in their thirties- the maturity and command of their artistry is constantly moving ahead of their years. Villazon, with all the bells and whistles of his top ringing notes, has becomes the spinto/Italianate tenor extraordinaire of our time that gives us glimpses- although I hate to make comparisons- of Correlli and Di Stefano. Netrebko, as a soprano, is in a league of her own. Her voice in any new recording sounds better than in her last one. The lyricim, color and communicating power of her singing trancends vulnerability, despair and hopelessness that are so well portayed in Mimi's duet. Some bloggers hate Netrebko's guts and claim hype for her success. That's a cop out. You cannot sell out opera houses all over the world, and CDs that have surpassed in numbers many classical recording of the past, based only on hype. There must be a substantive voice behind a beautiful face and body. I love and I know opera well, and I've seen, live, many of the great sopranos of past forty years. And if I'm flying across the U.S.A. to see Netrebko at her Carnegie Hall debut- I was lucky to find one of the last tickets- is not hype. No body fooled me and no body made me do it. For some, the jury may be still out for these two opera superstars, but this CD is an example of extraordinary singing and is highly recommended. Constantine A. Papas El Paso, Texa
1	great choice! There are so many different songs to choose from on this cd and it's a great buy. whether you want to play it while eating dinner at the wedding, to walking down the isle, it's wonderful!!!
1	Brillant recording The thing about ''Evita'' is that it is such a remarkable musical that the different interpretations are each worthy of owning and enjoying, much like listening to different interpretations of Bach or Mozart. The largest negative about this recording is that it's incomplete (which is hardly a negative: ''The worst thing about the London Cast recording is that there isn't more...''). Elaine Paige is stunning, and her performance alone is worth the money. Her vocal range, power, emotion, and expression are awe-inspiring, and the recording seems tailored to complement her performance. The orchestration is light and subtle, most likely to show off the powerful vocals. David Essex as ''Che'' continues to grow on me (my first impression were not all that favorable) and Joss Ackland is superb. The more I listen to this recording, the more it becomes my overall favorite by far. The Broadway Cast double album is essential if you want the complete musical and to understand the story, and the production is marked by full orchestration and very large cast. The concept album has its pluses and unique characteristics, but in terms of overall performance I feel the London cast does a better job vocally (especially Elaine) and the Broadway cast is a fuller production. I would probably recommend the Broadway album as a first choice, simply to get the full musical and to listen to a very large production of this incredible work. However, for subtlety, grace, and outstanding performances, the London Cast highlight album stands ahead of all the rest
0	YAWN - WHY BOTHER? UNLIKE VOLUME 1, WHICH WAS GREAT (IF INCOMPLETE), VOLUME 2 ALWAYS LEFT ME SHAKING MY HEAD. WHILE IT HAS SERPENTINE FIRE (WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON VOLUME 1) AND A FEW OTHER HITS, MOST OF THIS ALBUM IS FILLER (FANTASY AGAIN?). WHAT'S MY POINT? MY POINT IS THAT FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS MORE YOU CAN GET ALL OF THE ORIGINAL VOLUME 1, THE GOOD STUFF OFF OF VOLUME 2 (MINUS THE FILLER), AND GET IT ALL ON ONE DISC (EWF's GREATEST HITS). I'M JUST HERE TO HELP YOU DO THE RIGHT THING
1	Best of best! Listen to Havona! With Jaco on the bass, probably one of his artworks of life! Truely inspiring and magnificent for any bassist who's into funk, fusion, and jazz
0	Mediocre for Benoit I have been a DB fan for a while but simply found nothing new in his latest effort. The beginning is basically the same as "Fuzzy Logic" and "Right Here, Right Now", and the whole CD's format is just too predictable and less jazzy than before. He's probably trying to be a bit Brizilian but just not quite there... Not impressive at all!
0	worms I love Porcupine Tree, Marillion, Blackfield......but I find nothing illuminating about this album. I want my money back. This is very average at best. You should buy something else
1	FANTASTIC! I saw Leahy in concert at Milwaukee's Irish Cultural Center. The experience is beyond words. We were clapping, yelling, and dancing in our seats! That prompted me to buy their first album and I was not disappointed. The musicianship is terrific and the selection unbeatable. I've listened to it many, many times and it never grows old. Thanks Leahy!
1	THE BEGINNING OF THE END I have been an AC/DC fan for more than 20 years now. I have all the albums. And looking back, it seems like this was the last solid one they made. This one is not nearly as good as BACK IN BLACK, or even HIGHWAY TO HELL. No, at this point the band was not working as hard to crank out good material. I'm thinking that is why producer Mutt Lange bowed out after this record. He did the previous 2 records, and every song on those was great. Here, "Snowballed," "Inject the venom," and others are clearly filler material. That is too bad, too, because Brian Johnson still had a voice on this record. If you have heard him sing anytime since 1986 he sounds hoarse. If you want to hear the Young brothers at their best, get POWERAGE, HIGHWAY TO HELL, and BACK IN BLACK. Every AC/DC record since then falls short of those.
1	I cannot describe the techniques of this new Flamenco guitar All tracks are wonderful and well composed; I think Behzad is one of those fantastic Flamenco guitar players. I agree that this brilliant album needs reengineering and could take the first place in the world of modern Flamenco guitar instrumental album
1	Primative Blues There is something strange and primative about the beats laid down by Kimbrough and his band. A view into what the blues may have sounded like 50 years ago, but amp'ed up. It's tough to pull yourself away from this sound. Liner notes by Robert Palmer are also great. If you are looking for soemthing different, but great, check out this album
0	No wonder he teamed up with Billy Joel for tours Judging by both of their collections of "hits", the two of them produced some of the most annoying tunes of the 70s & 80s, and unfortunately, beyond. These two "pretend" rockers hit the radio with junk like "Crocodile Rock" (John) and "Uptown Girl" (Joel), thus cementing their respective geek reputations. Yuck! Neither Elton John nor Billy Joel have made anything authentic; they are both fake rock and rollers with repertoires filled with lame tunes, making them like the male equivalents of Gloria Estefan or Madonna. Yuck! Zero stars
1	Silky Smoothy Selections! Happy Days are here again with the release of a greatest hits album by 90's mega group Silk. If you were a true R&B fan in the 90s then you were a fan of Silk's music. They had countless hits in their collection, and The Best of Silk highlights practically all of them. If you include the opening interlude, there are SIX tracks from their first album Lose Control on this greatest hits disc. They are the opening "Interlude," "Happy Days," "Freak Me," "Lose Control," "Girl U For Me," and "It Had To Be You." They also include two remixes of "Happy Days" and "Freak Me" at the end of the disc. Songs from their self-titled second album include "I Can Go Deep" (which was also from A Low Down Dirty Shame Soundtrack), "Hooked On You," and "Don't Rush." Songs from Tonight consist of "Let's Make Love," "If You (Lovin' Me)," "The Return," and "Meeting In My Bedroom." "We're Callin' You" is the only song from their last album Love Session with all the original crew. Thankfully they didn't include anything from their independent album that was released minus Little G. All in all, this was a good package of solid hits. You should definitely add The Best of Silk to the collection if you don't already own the original albums
1	Third In A Five Star Series The rushing, lush &quot;Love Song&quot; by Ronan Hardiman opens this set with gorgeous vocals and Celtic influences over pop beats. &quot;Rushing&quot; by Moby is a laid-back groove with simple piano melodies on top. A sensuous female vocal is the centerpiece of Balligomingo's &quot;Lost&quot;, and the multi-layered instrumentation over a dance beat make this a prime cut off this CD. Thomas Newman's &quot;Lunch With The King&quot; is taken from the &quot;American Beauty&quot; soundtrack, and fits the scene it was taken from perfectly. It's a differently-themed piece. Pilgramage's &quot;Through The Seas Of Life&quot; has some beautiful religious-themed vocals running through this up-tempo groove. Electronically cut together vocals detract from the pure danceability of Govinda's &quot;Aspetta&quot;, especially with a lively fiddle melody that weaves in and out. &quot;The Garden&quot; by Faithless is a musical soundscape that combines new age, electronica and pop to create a danceable groove yet retain the new age feel. The jazzy &quot;Blue Skies&quot; by Soma Sonic is very trip-hop like, and includes high ethereal female vocals occasionally layered on top. Ikarus' &quot;Bassment&quot; almost sounds like a Fatboy Slim record with male chanting on top. This track isn't one of the better ones. &quot;Peaceful Village&quot; brings Japanese influences to new-age pop by way of Yasue, and does it well. A deep groove with vocals that weave in and out in a jazzy way is the trademark of Phobos' &quot;Soul Of Desire&quot;, a simply beautiful relaxing track. The Sprit Of Eden and Davy Spillane team up on &quot;The Sun And The Moon And The Stars&quot;, another track with an electronic beat and heavy Celtic influences. Lovely to listen to on a windy day. Dagda is electronic trance music with Celtic melodies on top, and while similar things have been done before, they do it very well. Their track, &quot;Shades of The Otherworld&quot; stands out here and Dagda should be a group to watch. Clair Marlo's &quot;Celtic Groove&quot; is exactly what it says it is, and it is also done very well. Another artist to watch. Alkaemy's &quot;Enchantment&quot; ends this disc, and does so in a laid-back fashion. A very subdued beat with Celtic mystic influences make this a beautiful closer for the CD. Yet another winner for Elevation
1	Wonderful Spiritual Music from Colombia Like many Colombians, I've known about Carlos Vives from his days of Clasicos de la Provincia in 1993. Vives takes provincial music from Colombia (vallenato and cumbia, among numerous others) and infuses them with a spirituality and depth that makes the music all the more worthy. El Amore De Mi Tierra is no different. Vives pulls from various fountains of Colombian music and turns them into flowing, rhythmic world music that is accessable to all peoples. The collection here is very good. While &quot;Fruta Fresca&quot; is the track that most people are familiar with, &quot;La Piragua&quot; is definately the best track on the album. An update of a classic Colombian cumbia song, Vives's take on &quot;La Piragua&quot; turns the song into a lush fable full of earthy melodies and a spirit of the Amazon without forskaing the song's musical roots. For those who are new to Carlos Vives, this album is a great place to start
0	Mostly a dud, unfortunately... Disney, in my opinion, dropped the ball for the third installment of the disney classics CDs (which is probably why you only see 1 and 2 advertised on TV). The only tracks really worth it are "I'll Try" (although I have no idea what that is from) and "He lives in you". Other than that, most of the tracks are boring and no up to the level most of the others are. I would not suggest purchasing this cd
1	Weird, funny, dark, strangely funky - Tom Waits strikes again I've barely even scratched the surface of Tom Waits' music, but from the three albums of his I've been lucky enough to hear, I know that the man is truly an original in the musical world. There is some Dylan, some Beefheart, some Nick Cave in there - but not really, because Tom Waits can never be mistaken for anybody else. He's a primitivist in the truest sense of the word - his musical and lyrical voice evokes an ancient wisdom with its jarring and primal diametrical phrases that cut straight to the bone. When we hear "Earth Died Screaming," we know that Waits is serious, and his vision of the apocalypse is drenched in the biblical imagery of sickness and decay. Fellow dark prince Nick Cave may know the lingo, but ultimately he is an historian who can cleverly reference ancient literature and religion, whereas Tom Waits has the voice of an ancient prophet. That may explain why his status as a pop-culture icon is sort of a "hobo guru." There's something genuinely mystical about him. "Bone Machine," Tom Waits' blisteringly weird little epic of clangs, twangs, and grumbles, was a powerful way for the master to enter his third decade of recording. Some of it seems a bit disorganized, and some of the songs are out of place being on this album (and those are kind of a part of what makes Tom Waits' albums so cool), but there's no such thing as a throwaway here. The melodies are strong, the lyrics are fantastic, the themes are steady and powerful, and the presentation is truly unique; the grotesque, sometimes bone-chilling percussive clangs of Waits 'bones' players are sounds that have rarely been heard before on a rock record. It's an aggressively experimental approach that manages to avoid sounding elitist at all - in fact, I'd say that in a totally whacked way, this is kind of accessible. Who can say that "Murder in the Red Barn" isn't catchy? It's a great little story-song with a Chaucerian barnyard allegory of man's violent nature, cycling around and around the "murder in the red barn" chorus with the bones bong-bonging away and sharp twangs of the steel-stringed guitar. "I don't wanna grow up" is avant-garde balladry, if there is such a thing - there's a static scratch in the background and Waits growls more painfully than ever, but he strums the chords and delivers his cry of fear against the wickedness of adulthood in such a heartfelt way that it's become the most popular song on the album. It's the same twisted logic that makes this such a fun listen. It's diverse, brave, gruesomely funny, strange, and unforgettable. "Earth Died Screaming," "Dirt in the Ground," "Black Wings," "Goin out West," "In the Colosseum," and "Such a Scream" are other standout tracks.
0	Kinda (...) Bad (...)This CD is sub-par. Most of the beats are cool, but they're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics
0	Falls Flat I just saw GYPSY and the well-known actress, Patti LuPone, playing and singing Mama Rose was superb. Her voice was a miracle of covering all the emotional turmoil that is Rose. She soared from sexy to demented to determined to clever. I came home and put on Midler's Gypsy, and it sounded flat, stale, weary, unprofitable. I have always liked Bette Midler, but this CD seems to have no dynamic, no sparkle. I think that you need a true Broadway diva to sing Rose, and perhaps even one with some operatic experience. I can only fervantly pray that the Ravinia Festival will release a DVD or a CD of the LuPone production. It may be unfair to compare Roses. Midler does excel in different material but I don't think that she was able to find the turmoil that is Madame Rose and to sing it
0	Five Star Album, Two Star DVD-A Mixing Can't say enough about this album. I got it as traditional CD several months ago, and it is, by far, the best music I've bought all year. Due the sparse selection of DVD-A, I was thrilled to see it offered here in this format. The positive reviews on the mix were even more encouraging. I've got a dedicated DVD-Audio player run through a Pioneer 135 watts per channel amp running Klipsh KG 5.5 mains and comperable center, surrounds and sub. -Not a totally high-end system, but it'll hold its own. I have to say that I was disapointed when I heard the album for one reason: Knopfler's voice is 95% relegated to the center channel. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but there is way too much separation between voice and instuments. The idea of 5 channel separation is a wonderful thing when done right -any Donald Fagen, Hotel California, but there's a fine line in the mixing between perfection and annoying. In my opinion, this one crosses that line. Some may love it; to me, it's unbalanced and makes for a frustrating listening experience. -Bria
1	Great collection I still have the tape of this album. The record was released in 1986, NGDB's twentieth anniversary, and it includes a lot of their best songs, including three of my favorites, &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;, &quot;Ripplin' Waters&quot;, and &quot;Partners, Brothers And Friends&quot;. The one song on this album that hadn't been previously released, &quot;Stand A Little Rain&quot;, is also excellent. Bob Carpenter hardly ever sings lead on an NGDB song, but on &quot;Stand A Little Rain&quot;, he does a fine job of singing. The reason I didn't give this record a higher rating is because one song on the album, &quot;Fire In The Sky&quot;, doesn't sound country enough, in my opinion. True, the Dirt Band had a lot of pop, as well as country and folk, influences. However, I think &quot;Fire In The Sky&quot;, on which Jeff Hanna shares the lead vocals with Kenny Loggins, veers a little too far in the pop direction with its saxophone, although the arrangement is excellent. Nevertheless, that's a small shortcoming here. Overall, Twenty Years of Dirt is a great collection. NGDB fans should have this one
0	Journey no longer knows how to rock on this atrocious album I've never had this album, never thought about getting this album, and never would touch this album with a ten foot pole. Journey by this time in their career, decided that they didn't want to rock out anymore. This is just saccharin sweet pop music for teenage girls. Like a previous reviewer said, this sounds like a Steve Perry album with the Journey name on it. I thought they were starting a decline with the release of ESCAPE, but even back then they could actually rock on occasion. These mostly are just syrupy ballads or just weak songs in general. Steve Perry was the shot in the arm that Journey needed back in 1978, but with this release he's kind of in charge of the downfall, also. If you like to rock out, this ain't the album to get, so basically take my advice and stay far away from RAISED ON RADIO
1	The Killer's Greatest Album of the 70's After making a well-deserved comeback as a solid country artist in the late 60's, Jerry Lee Lewis went to England in 1973 and recorded this great album that was a welcome return to his rock n' roll roots. Lewis recorded some good albums throughout the 70's, but most of them were aimed primarily at the country music market. This is pure rock n' roll all the way, with a couple of old blues tunes thrown in the mix as well. The London Sessions sounds like one big jam session with Jerry Lee Lewis in his prime, pounding his way through a selection of great classic tunes like Johnny B. Goode, What'd I say, Movin' on down the line, No Headstone on my grave, and Baby what you want me to do. The studio band of top British musicians lay down some strong backing to Jerry Lee's great piano playing and singing, and the spontaneous, live in the studio feel of this album is an approach that brings out the best in Jerry Lee. Highlights include a rockin' version of Johnny B. Goode, a superior remake of his old Sun recording Drinkin' Wine spo-dee-o-dee that kicks off the album, and a truly dynamic medley of Little Richard hits that ends it. It is great to see that this has been remastered on CD since this is probably Jerry Lee's most vibrant album and surely one of the best rock n' roll albums of 1973. Any lover of classic rock needs to get their hands on this CD. This is simply the best set of rock n' roll the Killer has recorded since his classic Sun recordings
0	Screetchy and annoying--&quot;ironic&quot; in an Alanis Morisette way I was expecting something closer to a good voice, or at least someone attempting the lyric genius of Ani DiFranco. Both Tracy Bonham's screetchy and frequently flat delivery and her inarticulate message were off-putting. For some great women rockers who manage to preserve musical beauty along with their political and personal messages, check out any of the following: Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco (even in her most angry politically-charged work she maintains lyrical beauty and ocassionally musical loveliness), The Indigo Girls, Sarah McLaughlan, Bonnie Raitt (especially her early Blues-revival period), Paula Cole
1	VERRY GOOD !!!!! THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSIC.I HAD TO MUCH TO DREAM LAST NIGHT IS GREAT AND GET ME O THE WORLD ON TIME IS TO.IF YOU LIKE PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC I WOULD GET IT
1	Wings of Gold Song number four, Ali d'oro (wings of gold) is a heart-stopper. Wow. John Lee Hooker and Zucchero (singing like Clapton on a really good day): "I lay down with an angel, lay down thinking, more than I could, really say" Damn, this is what music is about
1	incredible bluegrass This is a fantastic cd, and track #4 is an incredible piece of music. Particularly for bluegrass fans, and cloggers. It's become my favorite bluegrass cd
1	Best New Release - 2006 Another gem from AHC, diva. It's no wonder she's won NYC's own "American Idol for the Pros" (the MAC Award) an astonishing 14 times! Miss Callaway's recently released "Blues in the Night" gifts listeners with an impressive range of songs encompassing depth and breadth of the human experience. She has, to say the Least, mastered vocal performance. Her magnificent vocal quality, interpretations, phrasing, intonation, time and choices are always spot on. Her range is, as the youngsters say, sick. Just a few of the highlights of this project are Cole Porter's "It's All Right With Me," Stephen Sondheim's "No One Is Alone," as well as several new AHC originals! And, the hauntingly beautiful "Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most." The title cut gives those of us who didn't get to see her Tony-nominated performance in "Swing" a chance to dig "Blues in the Night" over and over again. And speaking of Broadway...the duet here with sister, Broadway favorite Liz Callaway, rates a Bravo-Standing-Ovation after each listening. This CD recharges the soul's spirit, so often chipped away by day-to-day challenges and, of course, the blues
0	All I can say is: Why? Why did they have to produce this album. From start to finish all the tracks blend to white noise in my ear. This was a severe disappointment. Even more disappointing then Eve. At least Eve had some tracks that you could 'aquire a taste' for not so with On Air. If you're a collector buy it as cheaply as you can and let it gather dust otherwise don't waste your time and money there are many more memorable cd's out there. I, unfortunately, own the cd and have listened to it many times and I can't even begin to tell you what one single lyric is on the album. That is if there are any.
0	Time to retire I can't believe this band is still together because their music was never any good to begin with. I know so many friends who are such huge fans of this band and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull. Motley Crue is the kind of band where you can just take their record and just throw it in the garbage. The only reason why these guys got back together is because they needed the quick cash to pay off their debts. To their credit, at least they still have some fans left who will pay top dollar to see them perform live
1	Compare this to Stand Up... Compare the two albums by Dave that get the most negative reviews, and it's like heaven and hell. This is a mfing amazing album next to Stand Up. I really don't understand the disillusionment by all these Dave Matthews fans over this CD. There are some pure golden songs on it, and like any other album, there are some not so great ones, but this at least still SOUNDS like DMB. I never had any doubts about this CD until I started reading such negative reviews. I went back and listened a little more critically, and I still stand my initial impression. Not his strongest, but still an acceptable album
1	Whitechocolatespaceegg allows Pahir to develop WCSE is perhaps Liz's most mature record both song writing & musically....the title track is both erie & sad, & I think the standout track is "What Makes You Happy" which is very upbeat & almost dancable! This is a great record if you like good songwriting & great structure to your pop/rock music
1	Very Satisfying With so many tracks, spanning both the first and second seasons of the NEW Doctor Who series, this American listener found this soundtrack very satisfying, because it captures all those highlights and moods I loved so much from the show. All those little songs moments that you wished you could hear more of. I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoyed the show
0	hopeless but cutesy This was a very important record to young nerds who bought the NME and Melody Maker back in the day. This is supposed to be some sort of subversive stylistic endeavour, and maybe it is compared to your parents Supertramp records, but it's really about how cute young Jim looked in his black outfit. I trudged along in my black outfit to see them when they toured Oz in the early nineties and they did their bit by being hopeless musicians (like all touring English bands of the time, such as MBV) and storming off like spoilt brats after 30 minutes or so. It was a hell of a lot of fun I suppose, but not any more about making interesting music than Supertramp, for instance
1	STD RULES! STD as in this album that is. It was a key decision to have Joey come into play on vocals for the band. His first album with Anthrax simply owns you. He has a really awesome vocal range and it always seems to captivate me in every song. He reminds me of Bruce Dickinson. I certainly agree with a previous reviewer that this album is superior to the highly accredited 'Among the Living' (which does rule as well). Now I'll try and give a rundown of the tracks: A.I.R. 10/10 - This song title starts Anthrax's acronym song titles. Has a killer riff used throughout most of the song. Lone Justice 10/10 - This song is awesome since it reminds me of another awesome Anthrax track, "I Am the Law" regarding the lyrical theme, however, I actually like this one better. Has sweet bass lines that stand out. Madhouse 9/10 - Has a funny intro with a patient's maniacal laughing. Always reminds me of "Welcome Home" (Sanitarium) Please tell me you know that song, although it's much more upbeat. S.C.C./Stand or Fall - 10/10 A thrashing motivational number we have here. Anthrax continues to bring forth stellar musicianship and energy. Very anthemic. The Enemy - 20/10 I don't know why but I really love this song here. This song definitely needs more praise from everyone. The backup vocals singing "SCREAMS IN THE NIGHT" is awesome. I think this song is about Hitler perhaps? Aftershock 9/10 Probably my least fave on the album, not sure why since it does rock pretty hard...hmmm. Oh yeah I does have a really cool solo in it at least. Armed and Dangerous 10/10 Really nice, shall I say relaxing beginning to it then like most thrash songs that start slow, goes into high gear soon after. I also noticed this has some really sick drumming in it too. Medusa 11/10 REALLY cool song. "Medusaaaa! She's starin' at you!!" Undeniable goodness here. Gung-Ho 10/10 Mighty fine closer we have here. Anthrax still maintain the consistency of high energy that was with us the whole album and certainly doesn't slow down. If anything, it gets even faster. The beginning kinda sounds like a Slayer song in a way, that's what I think at least. If you call yourself a metalhead, you need to pick up this masterpiece along with Among the Living, Persistence of Time, and State of Euphoria. You just have to give props to the underrated band of the Big 4 of Thrash since they were just as talented as the others.
0	Incomplete Soundtrack It would be nice, as a couple of other reviewers stated, to have included some of the "score" as well as the songs and arrangements already present. I was hoping their would be a bit of that when I ordered it. The songs are good but didn't warrant listening to the CD more than a couple of times
0	Not my first choice Johnny Rotten must have been upset with his record company when he recorded this effort. The production is sloppy and there doesn't appear to be any attempts at song construction. It's simply Jah Wobble wobbling along while Rotten moans and rants unintelligibly. It wouldn't surprise me if all the tracks were recorded in one take and in one day. Blah blah blah PIL's first album is much better
1	Let's make this clear... the average number of stars should be &quot;5&quot;
0	My ears, oh no, my ears! This presentation of Mr. Boone's deserves a 1 for effort, a 5 for the best bad thing I've ever heard. He made of mess of Little Richard's "Tutti Fruitti" way back when. So, in keeping with such destruction, he went after our precious metal hits. Funny stuff, though. I keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines.
1	Great 1st album, too bad about him though... The D.O.C. could have rivaled the greatest MCs alive like Rakim, Chuck D, and Ice Cube. But his vocal chords were tragically destroyed in a car accident after he released this CD. This cd is very good. It is one of the few albums you can listen to from track 1 to the end. Of course these days it's basically impossible to find one. The beats are great, and the lyrics are clever, although sometimes i feel they could have been better. His harsh sounding voice has a nice feel, and although he did release more albums after this one that were lyrically better than this, his (lack of a) voice kind of killed them. Dre's production is sick. Overall this one's a 4.5/5. 1. It's Funky Enough -Beat: 5 -Lyrics: 4 -Overall: 4.5 Sick beat on a classic first track. 2. Mind Blowin' -Beat: 4.5 -Lyrics: 4 -Overall: 4.5 3. Lend me an Ear -Beat: 5 -Lyrics: 4.5 -Overall: 4.5 A very hot fast rap by D.O.C. 4. Comm. Blues A break 5. Let The Bass Go -Beats: 5 -Lyrics:4.5 -Overall: 5 Great song with a nice bass. 6. Beautiful but Deadly -Beats/guitar: 5 -Lyrics: 5 -Overall: 5 My second favorite joint on the cd. Some great guitar solos. Rapping on top of a guitar is a very nice touch. Love it. 7. The D.O.C. & The Doctor -Beats: 5 -Lyrics: 5 -Overall: 5 One of the (many) classics on the cd. 8. No One Can Do It Better -Beats: 5 -Lyrics: 5 -Overall: 5 The title says it all... 9. Whirlwind Pyramid, 9.5/10 -Beats: 5 -Lyrics: 5 -Overall: 5 Great great great... 10. Comm. 2 Another break 11. The Formula -Beats: 5 -Lyrics: 5 -Overall: 5 amazing song. 12. Portrait Of a Master Piece -Beats: 4.5 -Lyrics: 4 -Overall: 4 Very good faster rapping by the DOC. 13. The Grande Finale -Beats: 5 -Lyrics: 5 -Overall: 5 My favorite track. It features NWA, with raps by ice cube, ren, and eazy. I loved the NWA stuff more than the individual joints by all of them, so throwing the doc into it is like heaven for me. overall i say this album is a must have for anyone who's into the birth of hardcore/gangsta rap from the Golden Age
1	Movin Melodies-&lt;~>-ATB what a genious I have to give ATB hard props on this album!!! This is one of most listened to cds ever. If you are into DEEP Chiller trance this has got to be a must for every techno, trance, and elektronica lover out there!!
0	FELL OFF For as long as i can remember i have been a fan of Krs-one/B.D.P. and I have to say that this is the worst album i have heard by him. Sound wise most of these tracks sound pretty commercial and could easily be heard on the radio. Lyrically the "Teacher" that we all know and love has fallen off to a point that he may never be able to recover I mean the lyrics are downright terrible. This is a sad day for hip hop fans every where. Their is not a single song on this album that is even close to enjoyable. Lets hope that in the futre Krs can get it together and release another banger. but for now I think ill stick with SNEAK ATTACK the last truly great lyrical album
0	weak, repetitive I am a big fan of Thomas Newman. This is just too much the same on every track, unless you like the Balkan dirge(s) for variety
1	A wonderful album This album is filled with very emotive and original music. My favorites are "Marguerite," "Canyon Song," and "Sail." Oregon's music is complex both rhythmically and harmonically: rhythm-wise, there is a 7/8 improvisation section in "Canyon Song," harmonically most of the tracks feature clearly jazz-level chords. As a fincancially stingy person, even I have no regrets about buying this album. Highly recommended for people interested in the art of music
0	Why? As other reviewers have pointed out.....why??? This compilation does nobody a service - it cheats longtime fans who have already purchased this material countless times in the past (although thankfully there isn't anything unreleased here to force them to purchase it) - and it is an unhelpful starting point for novices who are curious about Joni's brilliant catalogue. If you want to get started with Joni, buy ANY of her albums up to Court and Spark. All of these are brilliant and accessible enough to make you investigate further. At least her recent Beginning of Survival compilation had a theme - it provided a consise representation of her Geffen output so that fans who aren't too devoted didn't need to fork out for the Geffen Complete Works box set (although, it has to be said that the Geffen stuff is complete dreck). This collection has no such unifying theme, other than the fact that these tracks were all selected by Joni herself. Big Deal. Seeing as she now refers to her Geffen output as the most significant of her career, it's quite clear that she isn't the best judge of her own music these days. Avoid this and just work your way through her classic albums. You'll be glad you did
1	a very good cd I am a big Leann Rimes fan and i have every cd that she has out. i think this is an awsome cd. Everyone should go out and get it.
1	A great compilation of original work Blah blah blah - just go buy it
0	Agnetha at her worst Okay. Agnetha's first album was number one in UK or whatever, but I think that this is just another Abba album ...I love the catchy song: I Can't Shake Loose (No 65 UK), Wrap Your Arms Around Me (No 45 UK), Man, and Take Good Care of Yor Children. After this album, Agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in UK. A very disapointing album, and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly (from the first recording to the release was 5 months!)
1	Like The Record Company Says: This CD is raw & electric - and one of my all time favorites. I agree with one reviewer who said that he keeps trying to find another R.L. CD with this much energy, but can't. I doubt we ever will. If you like the "quieter", more traditional style of "Too Bad Jim", you may not find this to your taste. But for raw power and emotion, you won't find anything else like it. I think that's why I've played it so much over the past 5 years - it's just different. First you get lulled by "Over The Hill" and then crashed into with "Alice Mae". Also, check out the often overlooked gem on this collection - "Tribute To Fred". The range on this CD is about as big as the style allows. You'll reach for this whenever you don't want to hear the same old sounds
0	A selection---we need a complete set of all they did. The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun
0	Mrs. Blue Bird saves the day I bought this CD thinking that the songs, production, harmonies, or something would have been along the same lines as The Ballroom considering Curt Boettcher's involvment.....WRONG! In MY opinion Mrs. Blue bird is the only worthwhile song on this disc, and it itself is only a marginal song, sorry. I was hoping they weren't going to be some rip off of The Sunshine Company. They're not at all, but maybe should have been. I guess I was hoping for something that rocked a little bit, or had some killer harmonies, or some off the wall arrangements, or was at least up-tempo sometimes. Again, in MY opinion, besides Blue Bird, the songs are very draggy and slow. I've tried, I've listened to the disc serveral times to give it a change to grow on me. Not going to happen. My apologies.
0	Should never have been made This is one of the WORST compilations of 'acoustic' or 'remixed' music I have ever spent money on. I am a huge fan of the first compilation, Metal Mania: Stripped. It did *not* have a "Volume 1, The Ballads" on the CD jacket. This disc's addition of that title, and the retro renaming of the first, was obviously a plan by the marketing types who saw the success of the first album and simply wanted to make more money. The songs are simply really, REALLY bad versions of the originals. The Scorpions (one of my all time favorite bands) seem more interested in having the audience or their female R&B back up singers perform the song than to sing it themselves. The remnants of Ratt, Warrant, and Cinderella should be embarassed for doing what they've done to their few memorable songs. A few of the tracks are decent, but overall I find this extremely poorly thought out. I would suggest you make an effort to hear as much of this album as you can before you spend money on it; I am so dissapointed that I am not going to be purchasing another alubm for some time without real fear that it might be as poorly done as this one
1	In Response to "A Kid's Review".... Has it ever entered your mind as to why people listen to Britney Spears? I would expect a pervert to be too busy watching cheap porn, a redneck to listen to musical trash such as "Redneck Yacht Club" (get the corresponding titles?), and a lonely person to spend his or her time staring at the wall... being, well... you know LONELY... as you claim. Twelve year old girls? Aren't they still playing with Barbies? I guess you, my friend, are yet another person for whom there is no enlightening
1	evocative tracks it speaks for itself-someone broke into my car the only thing taken, my Diner tape
0	Not Received I never received this item, I put the wrong address for delivery and the sender said they never got this back. It is in limb
0	Disapointed this is probably the biggest disapointment I've ever had in a CD. When I bought this I was expecting the crazy Das Efx from Sewaside, Dead Serios and hold it down. If you know das efx then don't get this album. The beats are all the same and the lyrics are wack compared to what they used to be
0	Spin doctors, this was real bad!! They started so good, with the album &quot;Pocket full of kryptonite&quot; and goes on with this. thats hurt in my har
1	The Quartet Mr. Parker's first album with this group, O'neal's Porch, rightfully received excellent reviews, appearing on NY Times top 10 list, and so on. The group did release another album a couple years ago with a vocalist, so this is essentially the second album featuring only the quartet. It was released in late March by AUM Fidelity through their website, which is why I, and it seems the below reviewer, have heard this CD many times. I've listened to it almost every day for the past month, and I still look forward to listening it. Parker has said that he would like his Orchestra to sound like a quartet- no easy feat considering the huge sound of it. At times I feel like this quartet sounds like an orchestra, and not because they play particularly loud or aggressive. As a matter of fact, this album is in many ways very straight ahead, full of melodies, walking bass, in the pocket drumming, and intertwined sax and trumpet. The reason I say that it sounds like an orchestra is that sometimes you can just hear something bigger than the four players. It has nothing to do with volume. It might be that they play so naturally, effortlessly, and with such confidence in each other, that they become not only "a whole greater than the sum", but an entire new entity. That may seem like hyperbole, but anyone who has seen William Parker play live knows that many strange things are possible. More simply put, I think anyone can listen to this album and right away "get it". This is not avant-garde, or free, or straight ahead, or whatever other label there is. It is excellent music- and it also makes my crappy hour long commute somewhat enjoyable.
1	great music if you can tolerate the religious songs Some excellent pickin' and a wide variety of styles make this a record that people who don't normally like that twangy, twangy country sound will find quite rocking. Unfortunately there is a lot of religious content which some might find objectionable-should there be a warning label on the cover? I find that if you just think they are saying "cheeses" every time someone says jesus it is much less objectionable
1	Great collection from a tight group the Black Uhuru are one of reggae's greatest vocal trio's, the Wailers of the 80's if you will. This set covers a time period of their greatest popularity. All the songs on these 2 discs have a good groove to them, although some find that disc 2 seems to be repetitive. Sly and Robbie throw down some great "riddims" that will leave you awe struck. I highly reccommend this for people who just can't get past Bob Marley and the Wailers, it is a must have for any music fan, espicially a reggae fan
1	Great, dark, brooding. The mix is not up to par on this one, I hear alot of people complain abou the production. But the mix is my only problem with this very unique album from one of the worlds best metal bands today. Jas
1	A surprise to me Well , i get this Cd only a few days ago in November 2004. I was surprised about quality of his voice and of the entire CD. He had the ability to create music of a certain type without being repetitive. I especially appreciate "Til i get over you" , "The only one for me" and the title Track "Anytime". So dim the lights , hold tight your girl and let the music play....
1	Who reallly did the PRODUCTION!!!!!!!! It should be known that the incredible MARLEY MARL did produce this album. But, the man who was responsible for the beats was K-DEF! He did Funky Child, Chief Rocka, Here Comes the Lords, Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time, and From Da Bricks. ALL of the Standouts on the album. He went on to become a member of the group REAL LIVE, which also consisted of rapper LARRY-O. They were apart of MARLEY MARL's House of Hits production team. They released one album "The Turnaround: A Long Awaited Drama." For all Hip-Hip heads, this is an album that needs to be in collection. He also produced several songs on the LORDS 2nd album. One standout is "What I'm After." It is safe to say, that K-DEF is responsible for most if not all of the LORDS best known songs. If this album is considered a classic, then it should be said that K-DEF and MARLEY MARL deserves credit. PEACE. MADSCI...I write because I suffer, Inc. PASSAIC N
1	Absolute Heaven Very rarely does Jazz give me that wonderful feeling only music can give. I have the best of Duke Ellington, and a little known group headed by jazz/rock drummer Bill Bruford called Earthwork's; they're o.k. But this album by Monk makes me wanna sing, and there aren't even any vocals in it. I think Monk is among my favorite tunesmith's, up there with Mozart and Prokofiev. That is because no matter how many times you listen to their works you never lose the stimulation or interest for a second
0	good but not great Can "Miss Ross" let someone else produce her albums? She made some all time greats in the past when someone else was producing. She has great talents, a good voice although it's aging, but that's fine. This album made me listen to it once, and sadly put it away
1	The Time Has Come Man Jae Millz is like one of my favorite underground rappers of all time. I had most of the mixtapes that have his songs on it. This CD doesn't look like a mixtapes to me, it looks like his debut album. I listed to his whole CD and it's banging. The song "Shadow Battling" samples of Special Ed song "Special" on his Still Got It Made album. One time, I thought he was related to Jay-Z but then I found out that he wasn't related to him. Somebody need to promote Jae Millz because this dude can rap; listen to his rhymes. I saw all his freestyle videos on youtube and some of them were long. Some of these rappers these days can't even write rhymes. Buy this CD to support Jae Millz
0	The 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection is a better choice. I don't really disagree with the other reviewers' evaluation of Piaf. She is truly one of the great artists of the 20th Century. I got this set; and then I got the 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection. This 2 CD set has only a few songs recorded in the late 50's and early 60's when recording technology could do justice to her voice. The 10 CD set has several CD's recorded toward the end of her career. The recorded sound is outstanding; and Piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end. I know the 10 CD is expensive; but I prefer it above anything else I have by Piaf
1	Ahead of it's time This CD had huge breakdowns long before those were popular. Sure, they aren't as popular as all the "hardcore/metalcore" bands around now, but the similarities to that genre are striking when after listening to that music for a while you go back and listen to this one.
1	The Labyrinth soundtrack Love the movie, love the soundtrack...it lags a bit during the instrumental pieces, but the Bowie tracks more than make up for it
1	In the beginning... As a fan of the band waaaaaay back when I was in 10th grade (1980), I'm writing this review as the band experiences its renaissence ahead of its 30th Anniversary World Tour. Most will likely focus on the final recording "Synchronicity". I prefer to start at the beginning. Outlandos d'Amour landed quietly in the US as the second wave of punk-infuenced British bands began their invasion. It's hard to remember, but The Police were contemporaries of Elvis Costello, The Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, Ramones, and The Jam, and this album was released stateside at a time when Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Who were the reigning Kings of British Rock. No one knew it, but everything in music was about to change. In contrast to the hyper-produced operatic sounds of mainstream FM "AOR" hard rock, the police were a spare, stripped-down, reggae-influence trio made up of a frenetic American drummer, and two Brits - both jazz afficionados. Their sound captured the energy of the emerging punk scene, but if their arrangement seemed simple it was so only to let the elegant simplicity of their songcraft shine through. Amidst the roar of British Arena rock, The Police landed in America, playing small clubs like NYC's now defunct CBGB, to even smaller audiences. And while this was going on, like a hushed whisper -- a single song began climbing American radio charts. A plaintive, tragic tale of a boy's idealistic love for a prostitute. That song eventually became one of Rock music's most instantly recognized classics: Roxanne. With that one song, The Police pried open the American radio audience and made way for the eventual torrent that became "New Wave". As such, the band, and their debut album deserve recognition as a defining influence on the landscape of modern music, every bit as much as Nirvana or The Beatle's for their seminal works. There are few other memorable songs here that anyone other than an ardent fan would appreciate. Other than Roxanne, only the tongue-in-cheek, suicidal break-up song "Can't Stand Losing You" ever made it into the US charts. Still, the album flows pleasantly from start to finish, and the final cut "Mosoka Tanga", with its unintelligible lyrics, sets the listener up stylistically for the sophomore release (Regatta de Blanc) that eventually cemented the bands' now legendary success.
0	Oh, no; not these guys again... I'll admit it; I never was much of a Pretty Ricky fan, especially after listening to Bluestars. I mean, I like sex as much as the next guy, but that seemed to be all these guys ever talked about -- and it didn't help that they have very, VERY below-average rapping skills (and Pleasure's singing is pretty okay). And this trend continues on Late Night Special. Now, I won't say that nobody likes Pretty Ricky; after all, this album DID debut at #1 on the Billboard 200. But I have to say that this is another one of those cases where I looked at the other reviews and now I'm asking, "Did we all listen to the same album?" And aside from all the usual sexual talk, the guys still rely on dated rhymes, like "let me do you after school like some homework" ("Leave It All Up to You"), "you got me feenin' like Jodeci" ("Love Like Honey"), and, once again, "if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'" (the title track). As was the case with the first album, the guys aren't very impressive when they DON'T talk about sex either, mainly because considering the way they normally rap (lyrics AND style), it's kind of hard to then take them seriously (especially Slick). This is evident on "Stay" (but Pleasure's singing is pretty God-awful on that song too) and the necessary song about clubbing, "Push It Baby". And "So Confused" is aptly titled because the chorus is about being in love with a girl who's taken, but then the verses contain their usual dirty talk. This album also contains a pretty statutory song, the aforementioned "Leave It All Up to You". But in the long run, maybe that isn't HORRIBLE because teenage girls are probably the only people that'll pick up this album. Like I said before, I have nothing against sex, but if that's all you talk about AND you're wack, then it's really a turnoff. I'm going to have to pass on this late night special and see what else is on the menu. Anthony Ruper
1	Great for the true fan This CD has some favorite tracks you've heard before, and some tracks that only appeared on singles. The versions of songs from Do or Die aren't as good as the originals from Do or Die, but some of the new songs (Front Seat, Guns of Brixton) are great additions to any fan's catalog. Also, the live songs are pretty decent. Pick this album up only if you have their other CDs
1	real nice underground i like this tape alot (or well the cd-version). i dont get how ppl can dig the new stuff from 3-6 at all, thats just lame club music. The old stuff has the good beats...but oh well its always the same story: at first they make real good songs just to get rid of anamosity, then comes the deals the money the industry and they start to produce crap for the mass.
1	Excellent! This CD is one of his greatest. I'm glad he released this one because it sure got nice and worn out in my car. The first song, he comes out hard. I wish he would have sung more of these songs at his concert that I attended in the fall. He still wants to wear out his Til Shiloh cuts which indeed are classics but he is so talented that everything he comes out with is a classic. But this Too Bad CD is nothing to fall asleep on. Get it if you don't have it already
0	Old Stuff Look this album is old as i dont know what,this album wasnt even finished,they started on it like in early 2001,as far as tha production it will always be tight from paul and juicy-J,this was like an underground album,not like a world wide realease,thats why some will say its not that tight as production wise,it wasnt even through,thats why they put some of there old stuff on there with pastor troy and boo thats stuff is old,have u noticed that paul and others where just on hooks,some where supposed to be on there but paul took there verses off,because t-rock left over money and mic time,the album wasnt done,so there for they threw old songs on there cause he left,which was stupid because he would of gotten paid,so he left and now he aint getting nothing from this album,all that money is going to paul and juicy,t-rock is dumb,look tha unbreakables is gonna set tha world on fire its gonna be there hottest album to date watch,with boo gone u know they gonna have alot of superstars on there i would tell u but i got to go,if u dont believe me wait and see holl

0	STILL OVERPRODUCED BUT NOT HALF BAD Best Song: Moving Oleta Worst SOng: Secret Biggest Let Down: I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain and Sky Full of Angels. (Patty Loveless could have done wonders with these!) Other Good Songs: If I Had Any Sense Left At All; Room to Breathe; He Gets that From Me; Once You've Learned to Be Lonely; Forgettable: Love Revival; Somebody; O.K. - The Duet with Vince Gill which made such an impression on me that I can't even remember the name of the tune. The CD is way overproduced just like Reba's normal fare. But the material here isn't half bad. "Moving Oleta" should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for "Song of the Year". By far one of Reba's most moving performances!
0	Good house music does not equal good music 2 1/2 Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways

0	A Modern Minimalist Disaster I sadly wasted approximately 2 hours of my life listening to this sorely lacking &quot;opera&quot;. I was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece, but rather, Monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work. The tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development. Some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well, which adds little to the opera's overall effect. Listen to the sample track &quot;Ice Demons&quot; for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition. While I'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general, I can at least enjoy it on occassion. In my opinion, some minimalist works like &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; by Philip Glass are far more sophisticated than Monk's opera and don't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously. Monk's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves
0	Heh? You won't be my Yoko Ono unless I deserve it? You won't gain a career and fame overnight from absolutely nothing? You won't leverage me to the hilt? I don't pretend to understand, but I suppose I'm not empowered enough
0	I Love This Album, But..... ...somehow Sundazed screwed up the remastering. Several tracks sound overmodulated. It's the same sound you get when you overload a digital recorder, and I suspect that's what happened somewhere along the line when this CD was made. It is a loud CD. It's frustrating because it's obvious that Sundazed used the session tapes. If not for the added distortion, this would be a great sounding CD from start to finish. If this had happened to one of the Beatles CDs, the problem would have been corrected by now. But since it's &quot;only&quot; a Raiders album, I guess we just have to put up with this sloppiness. By the way, Sundazed did do a &quot;fix&quot; on their &quot;Revolution&quot; CD, which had the same problem. The noise was very obvious on that release, so I guess Sundazed felt they had to redo it. As for the other PRR CD they released in '96, &quot;Something Happening&quot;, it has the same problem and apparently no fix has been done. Luckily, some cuts on &quot;Happening&quot; are totally free of the noise
0	Ashes to Ashes "Phoenix": This is the first record Grand Funk made after one their core members was ousted--Terry Knight. It's a good record, at best. However, compared to the albums released before "Phoenix," it's a real yawner. The twinkie clavinet on some of the songs is hideously reminiscent of the Partridge Family's sound! It's the anti-GFR, I tell ya! Another negative is that the "Phoenix" era of GFR is sort of a precursor to "Christian Rock"--LAME! It's an all-too typical story in rock-n-roll land; the rich rock musician does things on tour that'd make the Marquis de Sade blush, feels guilty about it, and then hands out advice on how everybody else needs to find Jesus. GAG! The liner notes of this record states, "Although not a million-seller, "Phoenix" was nonetheless another Top Ten album for the band, and proved they could do it on their own." Well, I'm not sure just what they mean by that "IT," but for me "it" has to do with losing their great sound by kicking out one of Grand Funk Railroad's founding members, and replacing him with a large sack of Sweet'N Low. About the "Grand Funk Remasters": First of all, what took so freakin' long to release these records in this format? Why do we have to listen to crappy sounding CDs in this day and age? As Nathan (William Snape) says in "The Full Monty" during one his dad's (Robert Carlyle) clumsy dance rehearsals--"that were crap!" Even the Beatles catalog is taking forever to get released on quality CDs! ("The Capital Albums Vol. 1") Oh well, better late than never, I guess! I just have one last thing to say to the record companies, et al involved concerning this faux pas; guess which finger I'm holding up! There's a world of difference between the sound of these CDs and the sterile sounding earlier digital releases of the same material; that fact alone justifies buying the remasters. However, the bonus music on these CDs makes them a must-buy for anyone who likes Grand Funk.
1	Sumptuous, sexy and sophisticated! Even almost 20 years on this is still one of the greatest recordings ever. Musically it has stood the test of time and represents some of the strongest songs Bryan ever wrote and recorded. Stylistically "Boys and Girls" picks right up where Roxy Music's "Avalon" left off with lush cinematic paeans to the pursuit of love. Rhett Davies production is sumptuous, warm and oh-so-well suited to Bryan's voice. Nothing here rocks too hard and yet it's still nice mid-tempo jazz inflected numbers with enough beat to pulsate to but yet overall calm subdued and restrained. A good friend of mine jokingly called this the granddaddy of Chill Out records and they're not far from it. Perfect for coming down from a night of partying or as I call it the "ultimate make out record". And try not to sing along...I dare you! There is literally not a dud track in the lot and the music washes over you like waves in the ocean, starting with "Sensation" and carrying on through. It's hard to pick personal favorites as they're all so strong, but "Don't Stop the Dance" is a killer track, especially when Bryan coos about "footsteps in the dark, come together". In my humble opinion Bryan Ferry hands down has one of the sexiest voices ever and this is probably his sexiest recording. "Boys and Girls" is the equivalent of slipping into something more comfortable, taking the phone off the hook, pouring a nice glass of wine, kicking back and doing something you really enjoy
0	A major disappointment to me. The worst of the Morse era An album I was looking forward to greatly after the success of Purpendicular. I was let down. It has in my opinion only one really great track - the first one. I tried a couple of years later to get into it again, hoping it was just my disappointment in not getting Purpendicular again. I still couldn't get into it. I've read a lot of reviews that say its' brilliant, but I just don't see it. Not recommended at all. I know a lot of "Blackmore 70's era" Purple fans discount everything modern, but I'm not one of them - I absolutely adored _|_ as well as Bananas, but this one did absolutely nothing for me save for the first track
0	Very Bad This is like dull opera vs. Trance. What a waist, I am mad I bought it
0	PAUL WELLER'S FAILURE Ok, don't get me wrong I'm a major Paul Weller fan, since 1977, but apart from a couple a gems like 'Solid Bond' and 'Shout To The Top' this is Weller at his worst.After the rise and rise of The Jam, he tries to go all soulful and funky and misses by a mile.Don't waste your money on this rubbish, go buy The Jam boxset and listen to Weller at his most powerful and leader of the greatest band EVER
1	Superstar to Commercial Oblivion Neither Fish Nor Flesh's downfall is it's lack of real commercial singles and a certain jealous Sony labelmate's sabotage if you believe Terence himself. That's not to say the music here is any worse overall than Hardline. The unofficially Stevie Wonder Summer Soft sampling &quot;To Know Someone Deeply&quot;, Motown-esque &quot;Billy Don't Fall&quot; and the gospel attack of &quot;I Don't Want To Bring Your God's Down&quot; are some favourites of mine. Don't believe the hype, there was no dramatic artistic post-Hardline disaster
1	One Tree Hill Rocks Love the music!!! Usually not my style, however this is a CD my three girls and I can all enjoy!!

0	What am I missing? I think it is very admirable that Marsalis has attempted to produce a classical CD, however, this is not the sublime, masterpiece that so many previous reviewers have labelled it. His tone is particularly unstable, and not very even, his soprano playing is miles better than his alto however. This is a real shame, as the primary solo instrument in the saxophone family is the alto, anyone beginning study in classical saxophone would need to get this sorted first. His tuning is barely acceptable, but only for a jazzo, he would be shot if he played so out for a real saxophone teacher. Please have a listen to some real repertoire for saxophone, played by a real player, such as Bornkamp, Rousseau, Delangle, Fourmeau, Michat, Londeix, etc. This is a good INTRODUCTION to classical music, if for the first time, but please don't accept this as being the be all and end all of classical music, and of saxophone
1	A Hot TRAVIATA I'm bewildered by the negative comments regarding this recording. I finally obtained a copy of this and I have absolutely fallen in love with it. I have never heard a TRAVIATA as youthful, ardent, visceral and sexy, yes SEXY, as this one. Ok, there's some strange things in the first act, for instance, the chorus balance is off and Rizzi loses control between the stage and pit a few times. But, in the course of a week, this has become a favorite recording of the work. Netrebko's sound is gorgeous. She reminds me somewhat of the young Freni a la Russo. She's outgoing in the first act but introspect in the balance of the opera when confronted with real love. Villazon is a god here and although this role can be sung beautifully by others, I have never heard a more well developed interpretation of this role. They are both very convincing together and what a pleasure it is today to hear two young singers with personality in their throats. Their scenes have a desperate quality to them that no other interpretation has, as if they both understand how doomed their romance is. There's a pronounced dark streak of tragedy running throughout their entire performance that the others lack. Hampson has turned out to be a major surprise here as well. His vocal performance is complete and he develops Germont's character completely. Not since Gobbi's performance on the EMI recording (now available on Testament) have I heard any baritone really use his voice to act this role. I'm even looking forward to the DVD release in mid June. Putting the hype aside, this is one of the finest recordings of Traviata I've ever heard. The committment of the principle singers is just stunning.
0	Show me the meaning of being dated... The Backstreet Boys are one of the most dated groups of the 1990s. Lots of pop culture trends from the 90s are incredibly dated in 2006: Full House; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; hair metal; grunge music; the Macarena dance craze...but out of every trend that ever occured in that decade, nothing, and I mean NOTHING even comes close to being anywhere near as dated as boy bands are. I recently heard the Backstreet Boys song "Everybody Backstreet's Back" and WHOA!!! It was like stepping into a time warp! Every one of these cheesy, manufactured, synthesized sound effects brought me deeper and deeper into the past, until I arrived way back in 1996! This was an era when genuine musical instruments were virtualy non existant, and computerized synthesizers and drum machines ruled the pop music word. Sure these corny sound effects were trendy and hip in 1996, but by 21st Century standards they just seem embarrasingly dated. I can only reccommend this CD for one thing----making it feel like you're a decade back in the past. I can't think of any other group from the 90s that sounds more dated than these guys. "Show me the meaning of being dated Is this the decade I need to be stuck in Tell me why I can't be there where you are There's something dated in my heart
0	Same Day, Predicable Album. Kurupt has made some good albums in the past, but this one is real dissappointment from him, I Expected more from this guy, but the writing is not impressive and the lyrical content is out of reach, although there are some good songs, west coast fans will love him and that's fine, but I Thought it was too predicable and too over the top. Thumbs Down
1	Truly.... LIONEL is L-O-V-E! No one writes love songs like Mr. Richie! He's simply gifted! This collection of songs will have you mellowed out in no time. If you've had a hard day and want to relax, pop in this CD and it will make you melt and wash all the dirt of the day away! Exceptional collection!
1	Truly Amazing Having "Stuck On You" on this album (my all-time Lionel Richie song) is worth the price of this album alone, there are 13 other great tracks by this amazing artist. A MUST OWN if your a sucker for love songs like I am
0	Gould reconsidered and so should we Gould's '55 recording of the Goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man. Perhaps it needed to be played this way, at least once, or perhaps Gould needed to play it this way at that time. He thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time. It is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound, but how beautiful it is! Bach doesn't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did Gould. You can still hear his vocalise (love it or loathe it - I love it), but the passion, depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else's efforts too. Hear them both and then decide for yourself RIchard Maycoc
1	"We'll sing 'em all and we'll stay all night!" If there has ever been a better live album than Judy at Carnegie Hall, I'd like to know what it is. Simply exhilarating in audio, one can only imagine what it was like to be in that audience in 1961. How did they manage to not spontaneously combust? There are so many spin-tingling moments that one is hard-pressed to choose a favorite. From the subdued and sublime ballad If Love Were All to the raucous tributes Chicago and San Franciso, Judy covers all the bases and hits a home run every time. Even when she forgets the lyrics, as she does in You Go To My Head, she does it brilliantly and with charm. I've owned this album in one form or other since I was a kid in the 1970s and I never get tired of it. Even if you think you don't like this kind of music it is an amazing experence. Buy this. Buy it now
1	Keep on Shining The ozarks remain one of country rocks best kept secrets. Although the New Musical Express here in the UK described them as 'One of the finest bands of the '70's in any field' they are not well known - but they should be. Hailing from Springfield, Missouri the band are amongst the most eclectic in rock, almost every band member wrote material, sang and played an array of instruments. Their harmonies certainly equalled the Eagles, and their sound incompassed 'down at home' bluegrass, FM rock, melodic folk country, but also more experimental arrangements such as 'Colorado Song' on their debut release. 'It'll shine' is the ozarks second offering and it's great to get it on CD. There was a trend for bands in the early 70's to get back to the country, well the ozarks never really left it recording the material at a pre Civil War farmhouse with Glynn Johns producing. There is a real joy on this disc, of a band in tune with nature and each other playing to their strengths. Everyone will know Larry Lee's 'Jackie Blue' which was a big hit for the band and is good straight pop rock, but not entirely representative of the rest of the material, although 'Look Away' and 'tidal wave' show the band can rock. For me it's the lighter and rootsy material that make it. 'You made it right' with its southern gospel feel, 'Lowlands' with its magnificant harmonies and the slightly zany 'EE Lawson' typical of steve Cash's work. The disc closes with the title track leaving on a sentimental, and uplifting note. This disc is waiting to be discovered by any serious music fan - give it a try
1	Vince Gill? All the reviews I have read of the PPL CD's have had to do with the two leaders of the band, and while they are both great singer/songwriters. I think the real fun in listening to these songs is trying to spot that high, sweet, soft background vocal, and some of that shimmering guitar sound. It is none other than Vince Gill, you know, the artist to have won a grammy for every year in the decade of the 90's, the man to have quietly lived out one of the most succseful music career's in a long time. I just find a lot of enjoyment in imagining a young 19 year old Vince gill finding his way in his new music career. He's married to Amy Grant you know, huh &quot;Amie&quot;... Amy. If that's not fate I dont know what is. Good songwriting, check it out
1	NOT AS GOOD AS 6TH SESSION This is a good cd but not as good as his previous work. The 2nd cd is almost a throwaway except for the KAOS track. You have to see him live to truly appreciate him
1	Great remixes of a future dance classic This is a great compilation CD single. The artist put a lot of time and effort. She obviously sang the tracks over for each of the remixes
1	Great Collection Of Early Poco THE FORGOTTEN TRAIL is a great collection of early Poco. The only major item missing from it is "Skatin'", but you can get that on one of the group's studio CDs. As a person who's been told to use music as a form of anger management, I have to say that I prefer the early country-rock Poco to later pop crap like "Crazy Love" and "Call It Love.
1	A Good Album is a Good Album Thanks for the background on this movie's soundtrack Mr. Davids, and it's great to know you support Native American musicians. But to give this album one star out of five just because Lisa Gerrard isn't Native American is ridiculous, and frankly, racist. Peter Gabriel's "Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence" was a similarly haunting, ethereal collection of songs. The movie focused on the aboriginal peoples of Australia. Think anyone cared that Peter Gabriel isn't an aborigine? Like Gabriel, Gerrard has worked with musicians of several ethnic origins, and has always made efforts to support and promote them. This in turn increases cultural awareness of marginalized ethnicities for the mainstream consciousness, and represents one of the fundamental altruistic forces in what has been blanket-termed "world music." We should applaud musicians like Gerrard, not castigate them. Or, the very least, we should judge music by the talent of the composer, not by that composer's ethnicity. -Amahl Turczyn Scheppach, music lover. Ethnic Origin: White/Other
1	Fresher than funk Hmm, I've gotta disagree with the reviewer who rated this just another funk band with some scratching. Kid Koala takes a lead role in this band, and is not relegated to some background scratching as is often the case. The integration of the turntables is also far beyond what you might normally hear. This isn't a group where the DJ takes a break to show off his funky beats, Kid Koala meshes his skills seamlessly with the rest of the band. To top it off the vocals are superb, straight out of the congregation. This band is up there with the best of the new hip hop/soul/funk (Breakestra, Dakah, and Medusa)
1	Vintage Joan! I have the LP of this album and it is almost worn thru! I decided that if it was available on CD I would get it as a birthday present to myself! I found this to be one of the best purchases I have made lately. The remastering of the original songs is perfect and the bonus tracks are great! Joan's voice is still clear and sweet and very easy to listen to. Her voice got a more raspy sound on later albums. The bonus tracks were the icing on the cake for me. She covers a wide range of folk songs, from Guthrie's "Ranger's Comand" to "Rock Salt and Nails" by Bruce 'Utah' Phillips. It is interesting to note that the people who made the labels for the album did not know that there is a substance known as Rock Salt that is often used in shotguns as a 'varment load' and therefore list it as "Rock, Salt and Nails!" No matter what you call it I found it to be one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard. All in all, if you like Joan Baez and/or folk music this is a must have. Her version of "One too many mornings" brings back vivid memories of the '60s
1	best rancid album of all time! to me, this is rancid's best work. i don't understand why people say it's "rough around the edges", and crap like that! this is punk people! anyways, every song is fast, and catchy - which to me makes it a classic. this album kicks off with "adina", (one of the best songs on this CD) which is a fast short song, with awesome guitar riffs. and after you hear that song...you definetely will wanna listen to the next - trust me. and the next song "hyena", is another one of the best songs, and an awesome chorus that's all yelling...every song has it's own thing that makes it good. one of the slower songs, has got to be "outta my mind". tim's singing is what makes this song a classic (to me). tim's guitar work, bret's drumming, and matt's bass playing are at their best on this album. so if you're new to rancid, i would HIGHLY recommend this. if not this, "let's go" is another good one.
0	Not the same With Paul out of the picture, The Unseen are definitly not the same band at all. It just seems all the passion has been drained. This album has ok songs, but nothing special. Stick to the first two albums, which were some of the best street punk records of their time
0	*Thumbs Down* This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself "Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one
0	What Happened? I really liked Tevin Campbell in Disney's "A Goofy Movie". It made the movie really special. But now when I go and see what his old CDs were like, they sound almost nothing like the guy. The music is WAY too slow paced and his voice sounds bored and well... like it's just dragging on and on. Maybe it was because the music was more upbeat and bassey--not to mention totally cool in the movie. I only gave the CD two stars because of his terrific performance in "A Goofy Movie". Check out that CD if you want to see the best of Tevin
1	Mame is fantastic Not only for lovers of Broadway but great music in general I highly recommend this CD. Not only is the Jerry Herman tunes fantastic but Angela Lansbury has one of Broadway's greatest voices
0	What's with all the yowling? Amazing jazz but would be much better without all the yowling (is he okay?). Because yowling seems to be part of the Keith Jarrett jazz experience this was my first and last Keith Jarrett purchase. Check out something by Bill Evans. Make the yowling stop! Please
1	I have a crush on Sufjan. It borders on obsession. I think he's incredibly talented and I love him and all his music. This Christmas album really put me in the spirit. It actually reminded me of when I was a little kid and Christmas still seemed like a religious holiday. I am now an athiest, but somehow listening to Sufjan sing about Jesus just makes me happy. My favorite songs are "Put the Lights on the Tree" and "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing."
0	Watch out! Not the originals This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the Decca/MCA &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Ernest Tubb Story&quot; were pretty good...but this album is for completists only
1	Passionate, Intense, Yet Beautiful A stunning album. Yes, it's &quot;free&quot; and &quot;out,&quot; but it's also very lyrical and emotional music. One of Hutcherson's best performances, by the way. Tip: If Dave Holland's &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot; is one of your favorite albums, you have to hear this
0	Not loungy enough for me... This is just plain boring swing, there is no zing in the arrangements to make it special, or worth listening to more than once, this went straight from the cd player, into the waste basket. Not even one good uptempo song on the whole set. Boo
1	east west yes An benthusiast of both Philip Glass &amp; Ravi, I find this cd even more delightful than I had expected before the purchase. Listening to Glass's simple uplifting melodies accompanied by TABLA is exhilerating. Listening to Ravi Shankar's sitars with a cello line composed by Glass is awesome. I recommend this cd to anyone interested in either composer or style of music. It pleases both aesthetics
0	trash If you like punk, you'll hate this garbage. A total mess, and not in a good way. Throw any copies you find laying around in the trash and be done with it
1	Good, strong album If you like Damn Yankees, you'll probably like this CD. It's not quite as heavy, but Shaw & Blades complement each other really well and the tracks are all solid
1	A Work of Genius I bought this album back in 1973,and this has always seemed like a work of genius. The line-up of electric violin (Goodman), guitar (Mclaughlin), keyboards (Hammer), drums (Cobham) and bass (Laird)was new. The music is influenced by Coltrane, Cream, Lifetime, Indian music and probably Miles' Bitches Brew band. Although they use electric instruments, the music is complicated and difficult to listen to. Its speed and ferocity make it challenging and alien for those not familiar with jazz. Ken Scott who engineered for the Beatles and later produced David Bowie made the album sound like a rock album. At the time, the musicianship and the interplay were a revelation. Jazz critics accused these guys of selling out, but it's much more adventurous than the average jazz album of its time. in 1973, Jeff Beck declared the Orchestra the best band in the world, and he was probaly right.
1	Not quite the ultimate chill out but still good I guess after hearing the fifth volume in the Buddha Bar series, my expectations of chill out compilations have been raised. I have been spoiled by the diversity of the well-knowned chill out series. So when I bought Nettwerk's &quot;Chillout 2003: The Ultimate Chillout&quot;, I thought it could have been better and less predictable. As much as I love Moby and his song &quot;In This World&quot; and Sasha's &quot;Wavy Gravy&quot;, I thought those two songs could have easily been left off this cd. On the other hand hearing a new song from &quot;Delerium (&quot;Love&quot;) and a remix of my favorite Conjure One song &quot;Tears From the Moon&quot; made it well worth buying the cd, which I found a used copy in the used bins at my favorite record store. The Delerium song &quot;Love&quot; was nothing I have ever heard before from my favorite ambient act. Faithless' Zoe Johnston lends her stunning vocals to the beautiful song. I also loved Kirsty Hawkshaw's &quot;Fine Day [Frakker Mix]&quot;. I remember hearing samples of that song on an old Orbital song. Of course what is a Nettwerk compilation without a Sarah McLachlan track? To be honest, I actually enjoyed the William Orbit mix of &quot;Black&quot;. I am nowhere tired of that song as I am with Delerium's &quot;Silence&quot;. I wasn't too wild about the Telepopmusik or Fischerspooner tracks. Both groups I find vastly overrated. I loved Ihb's &quot;Olivia Newton Christ&quot; and FC Kahuna's &quot;North Pole Transmission&quot;. Hooligan's &quot;Hear Me Now&quot; and New Order's &quot;Your Silent Face&quot;. With all its imperfections, &quot;Chillout 2003&quot; is quite good but it isn't the ultimate chill out as the title say. I leave that title to my favorite chill out compilation &quot;Buddha Bar V&quot;
1	Great Listening This cd caught me by surprise with it's wide range of melodies. The more I listen the more I like it
0	Pretend this one wasn't made I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. Green Day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the "I'm still punk" notion which fortunately Green Day gave up years later. I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible. Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple. In general, unless you are a major Green Day fan, there really isn't much you're missing in this album.
1	Another excellent blues cd from one of the new stars ALBERT CUMMINGS seemed to capture the feel of SRV very well on his previous CD and it was excellent ( even if a bit derivative ). This one is a lot less SRV and a lot more CUMMINGS. Not one dud track and a consistenly high standard throughout. Definetly one of the best of the current crop of white electric blues man. If you like the guitar and the blues, this is a must have
0	save your money I got nothing but mad love and respect for the outlaws but they have def lost a step since pac's death. I think tupac must have wrote there rhymes cause they def do not have any skills. The cd also lacks production! The beats are terrible. The outlawz worldwide cd was also a huge waste!
0	At last! An X album I DON'T like! Here I thought they were infallible and they go do this one-off "ner ner" music that inspires intimate thoughts regarding blood relations and livestock. I played it backwards and not only did I sober up, but my wife came back to me, my dog came back to life, my truck got fixed, the bank took the lien off my house and I bowled a perfect game! Signed, epsteinsmutha
1	Dolphy and the European excursion For this Dolphy fan, Last Date stands the test of time as one of his finest performances. Recommended to any jazzcat into 60's avant. Dolphy explodes on bass clarinet on his version of Monk's classic, Epistrophy. Dolphy, Epistrophy...hmmm? The drum and bass work is nothing special but the Scandanavian team does the job. The piano player (also Scandanavian) is a nice surprise with interesting melodic and rhythmic chord placements. All in all, one of Dolphy's best and one to go back to time and time again for new insights. There's even a quote from Eric after the final track. A must buy for anyone who says they're seriously into jazz
1	Yummy A great album. Not perfect. The songs themselves are addictive, inventive despite sounding like something you've heard before, crunchy and sexy. I love how Holme's voice changes from song to song. A great vocalist, which leads me to wonder why Eagles of Death Metal has him on drums and that Macho Macho Man wanabe on vocals. The real star of this album though is the guy who's not even in the band, Dave Grohl. His drum playing on this album is incredible. Good stuff. Get rid of the annoying radio clips and the terrible 6th song and it would deserve a 5/5
0	Overrated Group When I first started to get into Doo Wop, back in the early '70's, the records of the Channels were some of my favorites. I played "The Closer You Are" a zillion times on my stereo. It just had this a particularly striking sound that you couldn't put into words. Earl Lewis' voice, to me at that time. was unlike nothing I'd ever heard, and nothing I'd ever hear again. I was caught up by the beauty of the "New York sound", and loved it. The same was true with many of the other Channels records that I got to add to my collection. To me, they were always at the top of my favorites list, or close to it. Nothing could dissuade from loving each and every one of their records. Until, in 1970, reality set in. I saw them live at a "rock and roll revival" show, at the Academy Of Music Theater, in Manhattan. They were billed, along with 8 other groups, in a outstanding show. Once the Channels showed up on stage, one problem became obvious: Earl Lewis couldn't sing to save his life. And these, supposedly, were the best years of his voice. True, he attempted to get through "the Closer You Are", "The Gleam In Your Eye", "That's My Desire", and several of their other local hits with the group. But every time he did so, it became apparent that the guy had no pitch. He just couldn't find the notes. The result was one of the worst listening experiences of my life. "Pain In My Heart" was a pain in my ears. You could say that Earl simply had a bad night. I wish that was the case, but every time I saw them on stage, probably six times in all, through the next four years, featured along with a number of other groups in other shows, it was the same story. When the group backed away, and Earl Lewis had his solo parts to do, he was about as sour and as off-key as a singer could get. (That's still the case, even these days.) And what was remarkable to me was how the auduence, at every show, never noticed. They applauded and cheered, as though everything was just the way it should've been. How sad. There was more attention placed on the nostalgia of the song, than how well or poorly it was performed. These experiences made me go back to my collecton, and listen to my Channels records with some better insight. I began to think that on a few of them, Earl Lewis simply got lucky on a few takes, and actually found the notes! The backup group, while adequate (and also somewhat off-key), isn't the greatest ensemble to hear, either. For proof, listen to their disastrous version of "That's My Desire", and compare it to the Flamingos' recording. For better, exquisite singing, check out the Harptones, the Moonglows, the Jive Five, the Dubs, or anything by the Flamingos. In my opnion, as far as the records of the Chanels are concerned, the best of the bunch are "Bye Bye Baby" and "MY Love For You Will Never Die". They were a better than average (on a few of their recordings) NY group, but hardly worthy of the praise they're given. And believe me: Until I saw them live, I used to be awed by what I thought was incredible talent. Not anymore. I hate to burst anybody's bubble, but it helps to put it all in perspective
0	Where did it all go wrong? Considering he was one half of the excellent Wham! great things were expected from Mr Michael when he went solo. Unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster. Fans of classics such as Wham Rap, Bad Boys and Club Tropicana Drinks Are Free will be bitterly disappointed. It seems obvious to me that Andrew Ridgeley had been carrying Mr Michael for years
1	Faith in George! After that Wham! broke up it was almost inevitable that George Michael would become a solo star, he had already had a solo hit with "Careless Whisper" "A Diffrent Corner" and his duet with Aretha Franklin "I Know You Were Waiting" was also a hit. "Faith" was released in 1987 and it also sold around 10 millions copies, it was without a doubt George's most comercially succesful album. "Faith" shows maturity but it also continues with catchy uptempo songs that Wham! were famous for, it's a great mix between effective soul-pop like the title track and slow personal ballads like "Father Figure". It also had a great streak of 5 #1 hits on the billboard charts. George also became the first white male artist to reach #1 at the R&b charts. First single "Faith" is a catchy uptempo that almost became a trademark for him. It starts with a face-up organ for most of the song but eventually a one-chord guitar is introduced too. It's a hell of a song. "Father Figure" is a far more moody song, infact it's a soulish ballad that feautures gospel choirs and a somewhat mysterious sound. Both Faith and Father Figure were #1 hits. "I Want You Sex l&ll" Is indeed 2 diffrent version of the song, it's 9 minutes long. The first one is soul-pop but the second in more retro-soul with horns, something that Phil Collins would have been proud of. The song was considered very controvercial upon it's release, both the title and the lyrics were offensive to many people and the song was banned from certain stations and would only be played at late night on MTV. The song was a #1 hit in US nonetheless. "One More Try" is a touching ballad about a man not willing to get into a new relationshiop cause he had been hurt so many times before. It was his 4th #1 hit from "Faith". "Hard Day" was never released on single but would have become a hit too I think. It's a uptempo song that reminds me of "I Want Your Sex". "Hand to Mouth" was also a non-single, it a great touching slow paced song about the American Dream. It tells the story of 2 diffrent people that both want to experience the American Dream, but none succeeds one shoots at people and the other one ends up becoming a prostitute. Critizism to Reagan's America, simular to the recent single "Shoot the Dog" towards Bush. "Look At Your Hands" is a jazzy song that also brings up social issues, this time domestic violence. "Monkey" is a catchy uptempo aswell, it was his 5th #1 hit and it's not hard to understand why. The ballad "Kissing A Fool" only reached #5 and was the last single from this album. It sound alot like the upcoming material he was going to release later on. The upcoming song are remix of "Hard Day" and the last one being a third version of "I Want Your Sex" this one is very slow paced though. Overall, A great solo debut for George that not only sold incredibly well but also is flawless from song 1 to song 11. All songs are worthwile, and he makes a good mix of catchy uptempo's to touching ballads. A 80's classic without a doubt
0	Great Music but poor sound Definitely contains their great hits, however the remastering is very poor. Listen to it with or without earphones and you can hear bad distortion. My vinyl recordings of these songs sound 1000% better
0	Really bad transfer Most of the tracks are severely clipped. You can do a better job than this with the vinyl and a PC. Very disappointing
0	Boy is He Faithful! I remember when Saturday Night Live did a spoof of Irene Cara from Fame singing the theme song from the movie as "Same:" "Same! I sing the same song forever." Maybe Peter should have gone that route instead of this album. I just got through listening to it, and have decided he should never have left Chicago. Sure, it's a nice, slick adult contemporary recording, but it's also the same exact song with different lyrics eleven times in a row. Sometimes he duets with two females who sound exactly alike--Crystal Bernard (Hee-hee-hee, gimmie a break!) and Ronna Reeves, whose unique vocal style even manages to get the authenticity sucked out of it here. Even his remake of the beautiful "Happy Man" from his Chicago days is reduced to an extremely unattractive entrail of itself. So why 2 stars instead of one? Production quality is key here, and it's nice wallpaper music for wallpapering by. Beside that, it's Peter, and at least his voice is good. Other than that, this is a lackluster piece of offal that I wasted under ten bucks on. My second and last solo Cetera album, I suggest you steer clear of this album unless you find 11 versions of one song entertaining.
1	Kraftwerk - good old songs first generation of electronic sound, very relaxing, makes me return to good old times....
1	What is going on? Ok, I'm getting sick of seeing people that don't understand why Mark Collie's "In Time" is on this CD. Let me educate you all...unlike Spiderman or the rest of the Marvel characters, the Punisher is HUMAN. In time he will die...all it will take is a bullet. If you sit down and listen to the words of "In Time" you'll see this. Maybe its just me, but I'd rather listen to "Johnny Cash's evil tiwn" than yet another Creed rip off or a "I'm pissed at the world" song
1	Chris's Second Best I've attempted to give five stars to 'Shamrock Diaries' so I can't really give the same to 'On The Beach' despite it being stylistically similar to its predecessor, and nearly as good. Really, a very, very good album with only a few clunkers. Great melodies, great atmosphere
0	Yikes! Sarah Hudson's album has been compared to Skye Sweetnam's 'Noise From The Basement'. WHAT? There is no comparison - Skye Sweetnam has actual talent. While Sarah... What sort of lyrics are - "I can't hold on forever/I know that you know I know" and "I wanna go shopping like Wynona Ryder" and "you better lock your doors/the bitch is back."? "Naked Truth" is not about the music. This album is about manufacturing a woman trying to be a girl, singing about things that she's too old to identify with. The tunes are trying their best to be hardcore - but they arent. Sarah is trying her best to be Skye Sweetnam - but she's not. Besides, Skye Sweetnam is actually a great role model for youngsters. Sarah is not
0	Not as good as I'd hoped I liked early Winger, mainly their hit singles but the entire "In the Heart of the Young" album was pretty good, if straying a little too close to Def Leppard. I have to say that those works haven't stayed with me, and are only worth a listen when I'm in exactly the right mood. "Pull" saw a darker, blusier side and was all the better for it. In the end, however, only "Down Incognito" and the fantasticly rockin' Leppard-esque "Junkyard Dog" remain with me to this day. I skipped Winger altogether until I read the reviews posted for IV. I thought I'd give them a try, hoping this time a modernized Winger would create a catchy yet serious side that held out through the whole album. Sadly, IV falls into the same category as an English journalist once said of British cooking: "Fine preparation, but desperately in need of spice." The musicmanship is top notch as are Kip's vocals, the latter of which remain strong and with the same great range he's always had. But where did the great riffs go? IV is a softly bubbling pot of an album. There are no songs that really make your ears perk and demand a 2nd or 3rd listen before moving on. Conspicuous by their absense are any lasting, ear-grabbing riffs to pull you in and demand you jam along. Sorry to say, it's an album of well-crafted filler
1	The album trivium wish they made instead of Crusade This band got it right for creating good modern metal. Trivium's new album crusade failed in this respect since trivium lost their agression and just sold out to melody. This album has the right mix of aggression and melody. The guitar breakdowns are interesting, the vocals are very good another good mix of aggressive screamo and timely melodic chorus.
0	For Jed and Granny Only I guess if you love country this cd is ok, but for those of us that came to Dolly durning her &quot;9 To 5&quot; peroid..this is really horriable music. Sorry dolly....I sold it back to the stor
0	To sleep! the only thing this album can do to me is put me to sleep. I do not know what in theworld was James thinking when he mixed this album. Not great, not pleasent, not good at all
1	An Overlooked Gem I've picked up all of Badfinger's album and this one is the best. My favorite tracks include Got To Get Out of Here, Dennis, In the Meantime, and Meanwhile Back at the Ranch. The Production is fantastic - Big thanks to Chris Thomas - and the band is tight! The guitar ending to Meanwhile Back is thrilling. The songwriting of the group throughout the album stands head and shoulders above any of the other albums. Any potential hit singles to go along with Day After Day or No Matter What? No, but there's not a weak song in the whole album. It flows perfectly, pulling you along with its sound, craftsmanship, and melody. What a crime it was for Warner Brothers to pull it after only 3 weeks! A definite overlooked gem
1	A supergroup that didn't need any hype at all JD Souther, Chris Hillman and Richie Furay had a history in the musicbusiness before they joined the SHF-band and it didn't do any harm I have to tell you. The album was hyped at the time, maybe the reason the group didn't reach to its full potential. The album still hit #11 in the BB album charts in 1974 with Furays''Fallin' in Love' being their only hitsingle. There's more here than just that one 'Heavenly fire' 'Deep, dark and dreamless' being beautiful richly harmony filled country ballads 'Border Town' and 'Safe at home' hard rocking popsongs which might as well have been recorded by Poco or the Eagles. Maybe that was the main problem: although all 10 songs where written by groupmembers, the sound was not unique. Never the less this group deserves recognition for providing at an excellent collection of 10 beautiful songs on one album. A huge accomplishment in a period in which fans of the more succesful groups had to do with one or two gems on one lp. They could saved their money and just bought this one
1	Sicx's Flows This cat can bust.It doesn't matter what he raps about,he's just tight on the mic.He is an under rated underground rapper so far.Believe me I know Hip Hop
0	Sorry Koop I am a huge triple6 fan, especially of the founding members. These guys all have tons of tallent and impress me with almost everything they touch However this is the worst album I own by any origional 3-6 member. I tried to like it b/c of how origional tha koopsta is but every time I listen to it I find my self skipping to the next song untill I have made it thru the album in about 10 minutes. If you want a real KK album get the devils playground. Thats a solid junt.
0	Only 1 Reason To Buy This: Miracle Legion! One of the weaker entries in this hit-and-miss collection of New Wave singles, there is only one legitimate reason to own this, but it's a great reason: Miracle Legion's &quot;The Backyard.&quot; Miracle Legion was a mid-80's college radio band which, like most of the college radio bands of the era, had that sort of post-Byrds, post-VU moody guitar jangle sound (i.e. R.E.M., Guadalcanal Diary, Reivers, Connells, Winter Hours, etc.). Not a great band, but this one song -- by far their best -- is unforgettable. An irresistable hook and some moving lyrics about growing out of boyhood make it one of those songs that, 15+ years later I can still sing from memory. It bears about as much relationship to &quot;New Wave&quot; as, say, Husker Du, but, hey, what can you do. The rest of this disc ranges from the sort of lame radio hits my generation was forced to live with at the time (&quot;Voices Carry&quot;) to songs so bad that the mere thought of them still makes me wince (&quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot;)
1	Great Song! The previous reviewer's reference to this song having the sound of Giorgio Moroder is right on the money. I loved Moroder's work in the 80's and that's what attracted me to this song. The rest of the album though is boring. This song makes up for that. Bring on the video!!!
0	Not as hardcore as it should/could be. Being a huge Gatecrasher and Cream fan for quite some time, I was excited about this new release. Well after alot of anticipation for it's arrival, I am a little disappointed. It really doesn't have the hardcore feel of previous releases. It isn't bad....but it it isn't great. It is not because of the choice of tracks that is to blame, just the choice of remixes. Many friends have listened to this compilation also, and share similar opinions. Want something better? Choose an Gatecrasher compilation from 2002 - 2005....You'll Love it
0	one good track Other than the genuinely great remix of Atomic by Diddy, the remixes here are highly forgetable. Most remixes completely miss the point of the orginal tracks and sound like they were slapped together very quickly for a quick buck. Avoid
1	excellent excellent performances by chet baker. his voice is unique and is highly recommended to all jazz lovers. It is so rare to find so many songs by chet baker in one collection and here are some wonderful songsby a wonderful jaxx singer and player
0	Dr_Bites Over the years, I have tried in vain to purchase the "real" original version.. Yes, Donny Osmond is decent and all.. I grew up watching him and his family on tv.. But concerning this title, they try to pass off the various versions on this site and in stores as "The Original Version".. It's not... I have the "Real" Original version on vinyl.. I've been looking to replace it on CD.. The "real" original has been way overshadowed, if not completely forgotten, by the various versions over the years with cast after different cast.. The "Real" original was actually recorded and released in 1971 ("After" Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), not before it).. It was performed by The Joseph Consortium, on Scepter Records, and had a black cover with a small litho-drawing of Joseph in a white and gold coat.. The front of the cover had a "flap" that opened up and told about the album.. The "real" original version blows all these versions out of the water.. I know because I bought them all, in hopes that one "was" the real version.. I give up.. If anyone has a cassette version or a CD performed by The Joseph Consortium (The "real" original version) and want to part with it, leave a message here and hopefully we can hook up and work something out.. Here's to hoping.. Thanks..
0	denlan It's a shame, I wonder sometimes how some no talented singers like Rickie Lee Jones managed to even sing somewhere and have a record company sign them. She's awful, no voice at all. I rated 1 star only because 0 star is not available on the scale.
1	Warning: Check The Shingles On Your Roof.................... .........before playing Mama Feelgood, or vocalist Lyn Collins is going to leave your home in need of some repairs. From the guitar-piano-guitar introduction, Collins delivers a funk tour-de-force performance in a classic song on a great soundtrack for an underrated movie that stars Fred Williamson. The score was composed by James Brown and Fred Wesley, which starts with a smoking R&B number - Down and Out in New York City - and ends drenched in the blues - Like It Is, Like It Was. It is four consecutive numbers which makes Black Caesar not only a remarkable soundtrack, but one of the best albums ever issued by Brown. The mid-tempo of Boss bounces into Brown at his funky best - Make It Good to Yourself. Collins then tears it up, with the ballad - Mama's Dead - a gem of an emotional ride by Brown. There are several instrumentals, with the jazzy Sportin' Life and the quick pace in Chase emerging as the best. Brown wore the crown as "The Godfather of Soul" after the soundtrack was released in February 1973. And the soundtrack leaves no doubt that J.B. set the rules for admittance into the court of funky royalty.
1	Perhaps the Finest Blaxploitation Soundtrack Ever If you are at all impressed with Mayfield's Superfly, give Black Caesar a listen. This album has it all- heavy hitting chunks of funk like Down and Out in New York City to the laid back pimpin' sounds of Blind Man Can See It. Keep in mind that this album was released within months of the ground breaking Big Payback. Buy this album, then buy Slaughter's Big Rip Off. You won't be disappointed
0	Songs that never made it This CD should be named &quot;Songs That Never Made It&quot;. Except for 2 tracks (Jump and Heavan Knows),which are available on other volumes, the songs on this CD are all unknowns for a very good reason. It would be interesting to know the names of the DJ's who thought these were their &quot;Favorite Pix&quot;
1	A very good Soundtrack of a very cool Movie! As said in the title, Strange Days is one of the best movies ever and the Soundtrack is really part of it. There is music through the whole film that is very important. It's there to show the viewers all the different emotions the characters have. Juliette Lewis who is actually an actress sings a song called 'Hardly Wait'- it's a Metal Song which is very angry and very cool. Jeriko One- the black rapper who was shot in the movie and who actually the whole film's about (and who's also just an actor) appears with 'hereWEcome'- a rap song which tells the struggle and pain colored people had and still have to go through. It's a very powerful song! Skunk Anansie have two great Metal songs like Strange Fruit who also appear with a Metal song called 'No White Clouds'- one of the coolest I've ever heard! The group Prong made a Metal cover of the Door's 'Strange Days' which is respectful to the original and very cool. The Dance song from Peter Gabriel and Deep Forest is great- just like Sachel's 'Walk in Freedom' which is very beautyful. In short words;-) I love this album and I know you'd like it too- it's really worth to buy
0	At the Core of a singer-songwriter This album finds Billy Joel at the dawn of the superstardom to come. There are a number of songs that could very well have been hits had this album been released after he had been internationally established with The Stranger and 42nd St. Notably - Miami 2017, Summer Highland Falls, and New York State of Mind are album-cut classics and are as good as anything he had written before or since. For those fans who were introduced to Billy Joel through Just The Way You Are, and the rest of The Stranger album, Turnstiles is well worth the purchase to discover a prior album of equal weight and substance
0	buena idea, sin concretar. No merece el nombre&quot;Brasilero&quot; este cd intenta ser una introduccion en la variada musica de brasil.Los interpretes varian de famosos a ignotos. Los temas distan de ser los mejores de cada uno . podemos acceder a diferentes ritmos ,y nuevas voces que son dificiles de encontrar : nazare pereira,sylvia torres o conocer a otros chico cesar, zeca baleiro,etc. Es muy desparejo en la calidad musical, y no permite apreciar la riqueza de los diferentes ritmos e interpretes. Las ausencias son notorias, pero es inevitable,en la amplia musica de brasil. No es un gran cd, solo nos aproxima, no transmite la riqueza musical enorme de ese pais y`para el que no conoce puede darle una imagen deslucida y erronea
0	A step backwards I liked the first two afterhours compilations, mostly because they are so downbeat and emotional. There was a concept in those albums. Now global underground (In my point of view, a very unrespectable company or "label") gave the opportunity to amateur computer-music geeks to become a part of what was a fine series of compilations (and good compilations are so hard to find) without using any criteria. There is a lack of criteria also at choosing unrepresentative tracks by major artists like Cinematic Orchestra and gusgus. Two stars, because I only like no more than four songs. And they're no big deal at all.
1	Heavy Metal Machine Music The intricate, extensive and sublimely rocking introduction to "Sweet Jane" which opens ROCK & ROLL ANIMAL must have made many of this album's earliest buyers think they'd fallen victim to a record company foul-up. Surely the soaring guitars, thundering bass and tight, swirling drums with which they were confronted couldn't have had anything to do with Lou Reed, legendarily laconic purveyor of atonal drones and decadent, rambling anecdotes. But sure enough, after three and a half minutes all that virtuosic showboating somehow morphed into the beloved Velvet Underground classic, with Reed tossing off his lines in a voice by turns sardonic, indifferent and haunted. The result was, and still is, an album both the hardcore Reed fan and the Reed-hating hard rocker can dig, an eminently successful experiment in classic seventies metal from a man whose prior recordings had firmly established him at the opposite pole of the sonic spectrum. In truth, however, ANIMAL is less a Lou Reed album than an album of Lou Reed songs as (stunningly) interpreted by what was then Alice Cooper's touring band. The leader's presence here, while significant in establishing the requisite dark, dissipated and druggy ambience, is ultimately more counterpoint than fulcrum. Instead, it's the beautiful picking of guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, Ray Colcord's nightmarish organ runs and the stop-on-a-dime interplay of bassist Prakash John and drummer Pentti Glan that are the real story, offering up post-Allman Brothers reinventions of Velvets nuggets like "Heroin," "White Light, White Heat" and "Rock & Roll" as well as several tracks from Reed's outrageously underrated BERLIN LP. What starts out looking like the most awkward of musical marriages ends up being one of rock's all-time greatest live albums, its dynamism literally unflagging from one end to the other. Recommended for...well, you
1	From Nantucket to PKM to Cry of Love...the best rock bands in NC's History In the 70's you had Nantucket, the 1980's had PKM & the 1990's had Cry of Love. All share a page in NC's rock and roll history and Pee Wee Watson played part in all. This is the rock and roll tree of North Carolina. I loved them all and want to thank them for the memories. I recommend all their albums to any. You can still get Nantucket's albums and this one from Cry of Love, but unfortunately you can't find PKM's "Rock Erotica". Maybe one day! I want to thank Kenny Soule, Pee Wee Watson, Michael Gardner, Audley Freed & Robert Kearns for some great memories. Daryl Boyette (formerly of WKNS & WSFL radio
1	The Goddess of Euro Dance Easily put,one of the best dance albums ever released.Alice has left a trail for all other dance dj's to follow.If you listen to today's stuff like Lasgo,4 Strings,etc....you will notice the similarities in the music.This album is brilliant and leaves nothing to be desired,providing hella energy and mega emotions.Although released in 2000,it's still at the top of my list.You need to hurry up and get this dance fans
0	Buyer beware I am totally discusted with this CD. I bought it for one song &quot;The Birth of the Beat&quot; - A wonderful 10 minute performance. When I played it, I found out it was a cut down version (3 minutes). Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed
0	Not that Great It reminds me of uthanizm. I did not like it. Theres no hard songs. I'm a die hard Lynch fan. If I your not down with uthanizm don't buy it. Its a dissapointment. I think
0	Not A Great Performance As a long-time fan of Mountain, I found this set to be far less than satisfactory. Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi are here, but Corky Laing and Steve Knight are absent, replaced by Bob Mann and Alan Schwartzberg, neither of whom plays well. Mann's guitar/keyboard work is surpassed in its awfulness only by Schwartzberg's drumming, which is simply dreadful. However, no one in this lineup appears to have any real enthusiasm, slogging through one ragged number after another. The version of &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot; is so long that it soon becomes an exercise in pure tedium; it's a wonder that anyone in the audience was able to stay awake all the way through. None of the other cuts on this album is much better; in fact, the highlight is the moment during Leslie's &quot;Guitar Solo&quot; when a speaker blows; the rest of the album merely blows. This entire set sounds like a contractual obligation, and nothing more
1	On the way to Graceland... I took my wife and parents to the Grand Ole Opry in October 2003, just after this album was released. RLH sang two songs, a funny one about breaking up with a boyfried and "Forgive". When she belted out that ballad, I turned to my wife and said, "She's gonna be a huge star one day." After the show, of course, we stopped in the gift shop and grabbed the CD. Good stuff.
0	A BIG dissapointment from a BIG Olivia Fan She has one of the most beautiful voices, and is one of my all-time favorite female singers. This album is terrible though. Unlike Agnetha Faltskog, K.D. Lang, and Alison Moyet, who (in my humble opinion)succeeded recently with their "cover" albums (made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past), Olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs, production, and style of singing these
1	SHEP FIELDS,VOL2 I've always enjoyed Shep Fields orchestra. This CD is an excellent review of the music heard back in the early 40's.Vocalist Hal Derwin's liner notes tell the whole story of the Fields band.Some remarkably good accordion work by Caesar Muzzioli with this band. Worthwhile listening
1	The plague, the plague!!!!! This movie is hilarious. If you need just one [outrageous] musical comedy for your collection... this is it. Zero Mostel and Phil Silvers are fantastic. The entire cast really gets into the plot. You'll be singing and dancing soon enough
1	sheer brilliance I love a lot of Kiwi alt rock bands, and while the Chills may not be my favorites (that would have to be the wonderful band The Clean), this is, nevertheless, a wonderful, brilliant record. Filled with quirky details and loaded with charm and appeal, this is what great rock music sounds like, and it's the best recording by this talented band. It also has one of the catchiest pop-rock songs ever written, the amazing I Love My Leather Jacket. I only wish Kaleidoscope World were still available for purchase. I also wish the Chills would consider a U.S. tour, but alas, they seem content to stick around their home country and to play only the occasional show
1	great talent combined I BOUGHT THE CD 4/YRS AGO;IT SOUNDED GREAT THEN AND IT STILL SOUNDS GOOD TODAY.SUCH GREAT TALENT FOR A FATHER AND SON.I ENJOY EVERY SONG THATS ON THE CD,BUT THEN I LIKE EDDIE AND GERALD LEVERT WHETHER THEY ARE SINGING SOLO OR TOGETHER/
0	Great Music &amp; Performances, Disappointing CD I must agree with the previous reviewer, who found this CD 'lacking in grandeur'. The vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered, and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written. But they are curiously lightweight, and I felt like I was listening to musical fluff. &quot;Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring&quot;--in my opinion, the most moving of all the cantatas--was far too fast-paced: it sounded distressingly like the Minute Waltz. &quot;Sleepers Awake&quot; received similar treatment. Professionally, all of the performers on this CD undoubtedly delivered, but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that Bach's cantatas can evoke
0	Noise, yes. Ambient or art, no. Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there
0	Nice Album Cover Watered down Album Album Covers kept on the Right path for the Players but the Music just kept taken a Beaten.Billy Beck is cool on certain songs&there are some moments here&there but Compared to there Hey Day this is like a Watered Down Version of the Band.some of the music is alright but there isn't any stand-out material
1	INCREDIBLE! This has pretty much summed up my own life story in Mark's great use of symphonic music intertwined with his brilliant fiddling dexterosity. I highly recommend this selection--it is the story of his life put to music. I know him personally
1	Bonus DVD worth price alone Some great reworkings of old classics, some obscure tracks made easier to obtain, and a bonus DVD documentary containing interviews with Dylan Carlson and European live footage. For the cost, a really great deal. If you're not familiar with Earth's music, this might be a good starting place, if only to hear Dylan Carlson speak of his influences and motives behind curating such a band as this. If you're already a fan, you won't be disappointed. The packaging is a bit generic, simple jewel case style with minimal text in booklet similar to many other Earth releases, but the music really shines as always.
0	I'll trade that &quot;o&quot; for an &quot;i&quot;, please... Wanna torture me? Make me listen to one more cowboy shirted ex-punk rocker mangling their way through the Hank Williams or Johnny Cash songbook. Get a buncha Art Institute of Chicago students together, buy some cowboy shirts, overalls, etc. and call yourselves Moonshine Trailer or something, sing in a WIDE affected voice and flail on banjos, mandolins that you can't play and sing about whiskey stills, prison and stuff you don't know nothing about. Welcome to the world of Bloodsh-t Records. A buddy of mine said that ten years ago the owners of this label would spin records at a punk club and they had something like three country records: Dwight Yoakam, some Gram Parsons record and something else...the title escapes me. BS Records must die
0	Interesting Experiment The quality of the recording is awful, which is not necessarily the weakest point of the album, as a matter of fact it lends aa appealing dusted, kitch effect to the music. The music seems to have been performed by ... semi-amateurs indulging in a recording session - it might be interesting for psychology students to gage the effects of... induced creativity. I do not dislike the album, I just think its merits are less musical than not. Amaon II albums are considerably better
1	Music is great, recording is poor... All the recording quality complaints from others are true. This CD plays OK with $30 boombox, but not on a serious Hi-Fi. But the music is really better than I thought. I was thinking French guys are good at love songs, which is absolutely true, but their marching music is even better than the German ones I just got (from the same company called Legacy International). How bad is the recording? It seems like the music was played from LP, taped in a dark room, stored for 5 years, and then dumped on CD... How good is the music? I still rate it 4 star even for the 0 stat recording
0	Shakedown reaks :{ The Song Shakedown Street is cool,better Live,the rest is garbage,this is there worst album not "Steal your face"even thou it sounds way to sleepy,ask a real Deadhead in your area for a cool recording,my guess is a live recording,please see Grateful Dead movie C/D,that is Garcia playn some Saaweeeet! Guitar, seek the truth and stay free Peace Larry Smith of Saint- Ros
0	Well.... Dunno..... I used to like Tiziano Ferro Songs. His first album was a straight hit in the face, a WOW! Great dinamic songs. 111 was more normal, more calm. But this one is really really slow... He changed his usual pop style for a R&B that doesn't convince a lot. If you like calm balads or are a fan of Tiziano, then you'll like it, but if you don't.... Better don't buy it
1	Relaxing night music David Lanz has really turned me into a new age music listener and admirer with his graceful and soaring piano pieces. I've never heard piano before that sounds like a living and breathing habitat, and since I've been playing it myself from the age of six I had an even greater appreciation for his art. As a composer he is a genius but he's just as brilliant as a performer. I can hear dark night sky and trees swaying in the wind, a bobbing brook running through a cool fir forest, a big cold orb of the silver moon shining on a grassy field and more through this music. Nightfall is truly incredible and unforgettable and hearing it for the first time when I was around eleven, burned itself into my mind and I swear it has never left. I grew up listening to New Age music and David Lanz, Michael Jones, Spencer Brewer, Nancy Rumbel and Eric Tingstad just to name a few as their sweet melodies on piano, guitar flutes and other instruments wove a tapestry of sound and color like no other. This album might be short, but each piece brings quality that no quantity can beat and that makes it better than 2 cd sets of New Age or any other music that I got in the past, filled with pieces but not all of them are to my taste. This album is sweet, dreamy, in places majestic and romantic and above all its filled with gorgeous melodies that make sense, and each one is a gem in my eyes. This has been in my collection for about thirteen years and I love it no matter much time passes between listening. I swear that listening to this really relaxes me, and right now as Im typing, listening to it at work, I forget that Im in a concrete jungle, and instead I feel like Im sitting in a lighthouse with a fireplace burning ( no physically possible I know but still, its cute) and I feel cozy and happy
1	One of the Greatest Albums of all time! YES, OF ALL TIME! I heard they spent 30,000 to make this album from a producer friend of mine. I BELIEVE IT! This is one of those albums that is almost too good to be true. I mean, its perfect in every way. From the production, to the Musicianship, to the song writing, To the variety.. I mean.. Theres nothing this album doesn't miss. Top notch, to say the least. As many other reviewers mentioned. These guys were highly underrated and overlooked. Its actually shocking because this has to be the most amazing thing Ive ever put in my CD player. And its a shame but you will probably never hear another band like this in your lifetime. Actually, I can almost guarantee that. What a shame.. This is a MUST HAVE album. If you don't buy it. Your missing out on one of the best CD's to be released in the 90's or of all time for that matter. Yes, its that good!
1	Still Standing When asked, nearly every Oasis fan I know will say that Morning Glory, or Definitely Maybe are Oasis' best albums. While both are very good, I'd have to say that this one is the album I'd have to go with for my personal favorite. Don't Believe The Truth is tied with this one for me. There's just something here that it seems like Oasis have always been trying to block up with pure attitude and drug-fueled anthems. This is the sober, matured Oasis who are left in the aftermath of their dreams come true, to be rock'n'roll stars, standing on the shoulders of the lives they created, with nowhere to go but down. Although the band was off drinking and drugs while making this album, ironically it is their most psychedelic and foggy effort. There are some of Oasis's weakest tracks on this one "Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is", and "I Can See A Liar", but there are also some of Oasis's best like "Roll It Over". Though this is by no means their strongest album, it is by far their most honest, and instrospective work to date. It's the sound of the Gallaghers turning away from rough attitude, and facing life head-on
1	Great Classics with a New Twist This album contains many Christmas favorites masterfully performed by Culbertson, et al. It is definitely a disc that you will keep spinning all season long to promote the cheer. His wife Michelle contributes beautifully on the vocals to "Some Children See Him." I have a lot of Christmas albums in my collection, and I honestly have to say that this is one of the best I have yet to come across. This is definitely a compilation that the entire family will love. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a little pizazz this holiday
1	sneaks up on you i scored this record from the buck bin yesterday. the owner of the shop looked at it like maybe it shouldn't have been in there but sold it to me anyhow. he said i should run home quick and listen to it because james booker is a revelation. right he was - when side one finished i didn't even flip over the record, i just plopped the needle right back at the beginning. it may just be solo piano and a little singing but the sound is big, beautiful, complex, soulful. one of those rare records that make me kick myself over all the years i spent not listening to it.
0	Hillary Duff has NOTHING to worry about! What a joke. She can barely sing a note or hold a tune. Hillary Duff at least has some talent. Don't waste your money on this dreadfully thin Hollywood has been
1	Wow! (For the most part, anyway) Having had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Haynes live and on disc in several different contexts, both as leader and sideman, I have developed quite a love for his music over the years. He has the unique ability to push the music to new heights while not drowning out the contribution of his fellow musicians. So natuarally I was looking forward to this release.I was not disappointed.Danilo Perez, who brings a wonderful, unique latin flavor to his playing, seems to be genuinely at ease with the music while still being quite creative. Plus, he is just very fun to listen to!John Patitucci is a bass player whos career I have been following ever since his days in the group Tamarac. His stint with Chick Corea, though, really brought attention to his very solid playing.Mr. Haynes, of course is electrifying. Playing rhythems and counter rhythems which would cause most other drummers nightmares, are totally second nature to him. After all, he has been doing this for over fifty years.In the end, though, all this great talent would mean nothing without good tunes for them to create on. On this cd that means a selection of tried and true standards, with a few more recent works added in for good measure.The first half of the album consists of studio recordings while the second deals with live cuts from a stint at Scullers.Personaly, I prefer the live tunes. The band has a tendency to cut loose a lttle more and take a few more chances. This, as is often the case, brings the excitment level up a few notches.All in all, you can't really go wrong with this cd. Do yourself a favor: pick this one up, pour yourself a cup of coffee, and prepare to be delighted
0	I was there when they recorded this... I was at Scullers when they recorded the live parts of this album. There were lots of great moments in that concert...unfortunately, none of them made it onto the album. It's like they took only the dull parts of the concert. The studio portions aren't much better. I'm a huge fan of Danilo Perez and John Patittucci but this album is really boring
1	cd laura brang died way to young only 47 i like her stuff my freind died from the same thing at 2
1	Firehouse talent...acousticly! One of my favorite cd's!!! Talent certainly comes out when they can cover an old southern rock hit like 'seven bridges road' and do it so smoothly! The acoustic guitars rock with rhythm and funk. I never knew firehouse to be this talented! It sure shines out in this acoustic compilation of their most remembered hits! Being partial to modern country rock and southern rock...I can't help but be doubly pleased with hearing a steel guitar added to my all time fav. by this band, "love of a lifetime". This is a must have for any firehouse fan
0	The Song &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot; I Like This Album, Especially The 10th Song &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot;. This Song Is Fun, And I Like It. I Typed The Lyrics On My Computer. In August 2002 I Sang The Song At The Boys And Girls Club Staff Member. Some Of The Staff Members Like This Song. I Hope I Will Sing This Song At School If There Is A Talent Show At Schoo
1	A great understanding of Tolkien's world What an amazing album! And who saw it coming? Jon Anderson's work here is the best, but there certainly is other great talent, especially on the last song. Most of the lyrics are in elvish, but there's some in english, too. The only real downpoint is the cover of "Battle Of Evermore" pales in comparison to the original song. All in all, this accompanies Tolkien's work fabulously. One little weak spot keeps it from getting a 5
1	4,5 stars - only a tiny bit worse than New Jersey Bon Jovi is a band that may not be the best one (the best one's were Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd), but their record-sales say otherwise. There is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated, as well as that they went big on Jon Bon Jovi's coiffeur and outlook, though. Nonetheless, I think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the 80's offering people catchy, competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the MTV. All in all, that's how metal sounded in the mid-80's (just take Whitesnake or Def Leppard). Personally, I have always been an advocate of this band, turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it. Yes, Bon Jovi has made couple of cheesy songs ("Always") and some both cheesy and too commercial as well ("It's my life"). "It's my life" was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts, but, if there are any open-minded music passionates there, you will notice that other bands had it as well (Van Halen had "Jump", KISS had "I was made for loving you"). One has to take the band as a whole, and simply can't deny the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like "New Jersey" or "Keep the faith". So, if you are too narrow-minded to rate this, you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower. Before "KTF" was released Bon Jovi came into the studio very motivated and full of energy after a well-deserved 4-year- break that immediately followed the incredible "New Jersey" tour. They had sold out stadiums, giving over 200 concerts all around the world and the tour itself consolidated their position on the music market and confirmed how well they do on-stage. But unfortunately it also put on the brink their common career as a band. "Five different guys took five different planes to five different places. There were no goodbyes" - JBJ once used to say. No wonder "Keep the faith" was the ultimate, long-awiated album in the 90's and this waiting had 2 major purposes: 1)to finally write off the larger-than-life 80's survivor as a mere, temporary, fashion-yielding hair-band 2)or to prove people that Jon & Richie were in fact much more than "Living on a prayer" and were capable of adopting to the changable 90's music scene (with grunge at the forefront). For the first group of critics, like the above-underwritten Amazon reviewer Andrew Mueller being sic and tired of Bon Jovi's recent expansion, the very album - no matter how good it might turn out to be - was a blessing so much awaited to prey on, that he boldly, blatantly and with a smirk on his face dismissed even such masterpieces like "Dry county"; and that doing this with a mere wave of a hand, claiming it's "pointless" or "longish". Pathetic indeed, but it shows how much stirr there was once the album has been released. Fortunately, the CD speaks for itself and proves again that if BJ's star was ever to be thwarted for good - then it should have been done much earlier, namely right after their second "7800 fahrenheit". Ironically enough, their debut album was received very well on both sides of the ocean, and most of the critics that hated "Slippery when wet" (see acclaimed British music magazine "Kerrang") showed much warmth and sympathy towards it. As far as the second group of people - they once again got a longplay that fully satisfied their crave for tuneful, melodic rock; yet not an ordinary hair-metal this time. Jon knew it well and it wasn't only for his change of haircut. The singalong choruses remained the same, the peculiar BJ-flow that makes people tapping their fingers as well; yet the album is much more than that, being a lot more mature in terms of lyrics, diversity and overall coherence. If the title song was to become the new "Living on a prayer" and "Bed of roses" a new "I'll be there for you", then OK - it would indicate that a new era for the band has just begun. But if someone ever bought "Slippery when wet" just for 2 songs dismissing the rest, then he/she is not going to do this this time, with this album, I'm telling you. The epic "Dry county" was reviewed and summarized many times so far, but I don't know if it abides any summary in fact; since this is one of the songs you must hear and relish in it every single time, peruse every single tune, from the very beginning, climaxing with Richie's solo, and fading away with Dave's keyboards. I was on a concert in Germany a month ago ("Have a nice day" tour) and you can't imagine what a surprise it was for me when they played this one at the very end of the show! Whooah, this is one of the moments I will remeber until the end of my life. With tears in your eyes, you live for such moments. "Dry county" is also undoubtedly the most accomplished, advanced and ambitious band's effort, looking at the entire 20-some-years-career. It is a class for itself, compare this epic to "Stairway to heaven", "Shine on you crazy diamond" or GunsNRoses' "November rain". I wont't exaggerate at all if I say this album is worth having just for this single track, since it is one of the most important songs that have ever been recorded. Let people like Andrew Mueller - with full respect towards his work and criticism - long live they in their blissful oblivion dismissing "Dry county" as "pointless". But "Keep the faith" is a lot more than "Dry county", I tell you. "If I was your mother", which is my second favourite track here, is a huge bow towards grunge music; "Fear" as well. It clearly shows that guys took into account changing fashions and wrote these two almost-heavy-metal tracks. The "Mother's" riff is incredible, merging Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Guns N Roses. "In these arms" and "I'll sleep when I'm dead" are happy-rockers that can be hummed any time on a party, somewhat reminescent of the recent albums, like "99 in the shade" or something ! "Little bit of soul" and "Blame it on the love of rock n roll" are two very good tracks - yet again in another mood - that close this marvelous album and, merging soul and blues, make a final statement about the incredible diversity "Keep the faith" offers. Of course "Bed of roses" was a huge hit and is arguably their best ballad ever, whereas the title track - being the first single at the same time - made it into the US Top20, is very heavy with incredible Sambora's guitar-solo, and it also smacks somewhat of grunge. Overall, this is an incredibly miscellanous and diverse record that you won't get bored of... never! The only reason why I'm not giving full 5 stars (but 4,5) is because I've got acquainted with the take-off material from those sessions, and it stirrs the entity for me, I don't know why but somehow it does. It gets my goat that the band not always makes the right choice when it eventually goes to make the final song-selection. Tracks that appeared recently on the jubille "100,000,000 million fans can't be wrong", like "The fire inside", "Sympathy" or "Temptation" really should have made this great album. Had these great songs been included istead of cheesy ballad "I want you" or mediocre "Woman in love", it could have been one of the greatest and most diverse albums in music history. Probably other Bon Jovi-fans agree with me. Anyway, this is an incredible album, almost as good as "New Jersey". Only "NJ" didn't have 2 less strong songs, it was almost perfect... well just kidding, OK it had terrible "Bad medicine" ;-)) This is a MUST-HAVE.
0	Spectrum too sweet This recording has a lot to answer for, having spawned literally a thousand similar relaxation records. I bought it enthusiastically in the mid-seventies. How has it aged? Not very well, I`m afraid, the passing years revealing all too well its lack of musical substance. I will not deny that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults. But I cannot stomach his pretense that this Western diatonic scale rambling is being linked to the actual activity of the chakra system. This is the stuff confusion is made of, and Halpern would deserve more than two stars if he simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces, not calling it music with actual ability to heal
1	What?! No electronics! Hurray! Armaggedon, Gone In 60 Seconds, Enemy of the State, Deep Blue Sea, American Outlaws, National Treasure. Most of these scores are good but all too electonic. Rabin restrains himself from using any electronic instrument on this score. From the get-go, the score sounds like a mix of Saving Private Ryan for the main theme and a hint of The Thin Red Line for the subtle moments. Its a well done mixture. "The Rescue" starts off much like the Saving Private Ryan ending with a patriotic brass section. The song greatly displays Rabin's departure from his more recent scores. Another good track featuring the brassy theme in its entirety is "The Great Raid". The complete theme is not heard on the movie but at least we get it on the album. There is only one action song and two tense songs. "Raid Begins" is action. "Rangers Start" and "Stealing Medicine" are tense. "The Geat Raid" track is a mixture of both elements since its a bit tense before coming to a tiumphant close to signal the conclusion of the raid. This score is orchestral, a first for Rabin making this his most challenging. I recommend this score to all drama score lovers. I also recommend Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, We Were Soldiers and The Thin Red Line as well
1	Probably the most fun on a Police album I first listened to the two main singles from this album, "Message in a Bottle" and "Walking on the Moon," when I bought the greatest hits album. "Walking on the Moon" has slowly become my favorite Police song mainly for its simplistic yet hypnotic rhythm and its quirky yet intriguing lyrics. I had heard the track "The Bed's Too Big Without You" some time later, and I decided to buy this album. The same time, I bought Synchronicity, being as that is their final proper album and had some great tracks on it. The funny thing is this: I found Synchronicity to be a let-down and Regatta de Blanc to be a triumph. The key to this whole album is what the title of is means: White Reggae. With a heavy influence of reggae, all of the songs come together in a nice fashion. The lyrics have some bite to it and the music can be fierce when it needs to be, but the Police finally sit back and develop intricate rhythms too all of their songs. Sting said that he used the spacious reggae bass style because it gave him room to sing, and it absolutely shows here. He beats the hell out of UB40 when it comes to white reggae singing. His voice is absolutely unique, a true instrument rather than just a voice. Summers develops a cool, collected style of guitar, loud when it needs to be, but never too flashy. Copeland encompasses everything and becomes one of the greatest drummers to walk the planet. Nothing shows that cohesion more than the instrumental title track, and it deservedly won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. That track sums up the album very nicely: a straight rock album with the intricacies of reggae, and it stands just underneath Zenyatta Mondatta as the best of the Police
1	A Revelation! I thought I was taking a bit of chance buying this cd, as I was only familiar with the classics "For Your Love" and "Heart Full of Soul", but I was on a British Invasion kick. Wow! This cd like, blew me away, man. For only one surprise, I was delighted to discover "Shapes of Things" - a great tune I certainly remembered, but never knew its name or its YB origin. The only other piece I sort of recall was "The Train Kept A-Rollin" which was featured in re-worked form in the Antonioni film "Blow Up". This, and the rest that was completely new to me, I just love: "Evil Hearted You" and "Mr. You're a Better Man Than I" are two others I find buzzing through my head throughout the day. Even if I'm a tad less patient with live stuff, which can veer into show-offy, formless indulgence, these guys can pull it off, as I find myself digging that fuzz-guitar/feedback rave-up (plus they know enough not to go on forever). I'll most definitely look into this band further - their music and their story. Enthusiastically recommended to anyone with any curiousity about this band
0	Egotistical Blowhard I went to see Mato's reinvented Indigenous 2 nights ago with high expectations. I have been a fan and seen him many times with the family members that he has since DUMPED because someone got him to believe they weren't good enough. The sound mix was so BAD it was painful to my ears, it physically hurt. Mato came off so look-at-me egotistical it would have been laughable if it wasn't so offensive. New band members - nothing special, certainly no great improvement from his family which he obviously does not understand was a portion of his band's original appeal. I walked out on a 15 dollar ticket to save my ears. In the past couple days I have visited with a few people and they ALL said the same word "DISAPPOINTING". In summation - I highly recommend the early Indigenous recordings. I strongly advise you to AVOID the new and supposedly improved "Mato" and any new recordings. Hopefully he will come back down to earth and rediscover his roots but I doubt it. I gave 1 star only because the review format forced me to
1	Makes you want to get up and DANCE! My first Zydeco experience took place a few years ago when Queen Ida visited the Twin Cities. I made my first trip to New Orleans this Spring and purchased Putumayo Presents: Zydeco at a local music store. The real thing doesn't come around here often enough, but I certainly can &quot;cha cha cha&quot; in my living room with this CD
0	Useful info in buying Karaoke CD's I host a Karaoke show in Nashville. I have never bought Disney Karaoke CD's. However, I will offer you one tip. A lot of people are mislead by &quot;Karaoke Cd&quot;. Always read on the disc and make sure it says CD+G on it. I bought some Chartbuster Karaoke CD's that were on clearance for 2.99 each. I thought I had a deal. It was just that-a CD and not a CD+G (Compact disc + graphics). Fortunatly, they took them back and refunded my money. Karaoke CD's are usually just background music
1	I like Todd but I'm baffled by this CD. The first track listed is "Elmo and Henry", but track 1 is just some short, faint instrumental. The lyrics to "Elmo and Henry" are in the CD liner, but no such song on the CD. Also, the liner contains lyrics to two songs titled "Dance, Dance, Dance" and "Promises to Keep", but again, no such songs on the CD. What is on the CD are some pretty cool songs by a talented wordsmith and musician. I highly recommend it! Just can't make sense of what's in the liner and what is and isn't on the actual CD
1	Sophisticated Funk This was my introduction to T.O.P. and it gradually became a collection of undiscovered classics for me personally. This brand of big & intricate funk really grows on you. If you haven't bought a copy yet, go ahead and "Knock Yourself Out.
1	TRULY A SENSATIONAL PIECE! This music makes you want to get up and dance! The first few tracks are the best, but the whole CD is very good. I could not stop listening to son fro by africando and many more. Hide this CD because once you pop it in, your friends will never want to give it back to you. After owning gypsy caravan, afro-latino, afro latin party, salsa around the world, cuba and many more i have come to say that this is one of the best putumayo we have seen up to date. Also check out putumayo colombia-It is sure to get you dancing like you have never danced before!
0	The luster left before this album I am amazed that this album has gotten such good reviews here. This starts Kim's long descent into his boogie demise. If you want to hear Savoy Brown at their finest and the music that gave them their acclaim, buy "Looking In" and "Raw Sienna". If you like the blues side of their music get "Blue Matter". But by the time this album came out, the magic was gone
0	&quot;Why&quot; you ask? Because most everybody wanted to stick a dirty sock down Eric Burdon's mouth, that's why. The Animals were great (a later incarnation included Andy Summers), but Burdon just absolutely alienated anyone with an IQ of greater than &quot;10&quot; by his flat vocals and his embarrassingly poor Jagger imitation
1	As good as it gets for Old Blue Eyes! How could you not love this whole set? There are swinging tunes and there are those beautiful love songs. The last cut, ... "The Last Dance" closes out my new book, ... "Southside Kid" (L. Curt Erler) also available here at AMAZON.COM If yoy dig Frank's music and those swinging days of Jazz and Rock'n'Roll in Chicago, ... you'll enjoy "Southside Kid" Keep Smilin', Cur
1	So deserved to win Last Comic Standing! This guy is amazingly funny! I saw him live last week and I laughed my ass off! Go see him if you can and buy his CD. He's alot funnier (& dirtier) than you saw on Last Comic Standing. Gary Gulman is good but Alonzo has the goods
0	Don't buy the Century Media version!!!! An excellent release .... just don't buy this version. The Century Media release with the Bonus Tracks contains audio that appears to have gone through some kind of lossy audio encoding process (i.e. encoded to MP3 then back to PCM) before being sent to the manufacturing plant. Avoid this one, check out the other versions and make sure you receive the full audio spectrum that you paid for.
0	Paleolithic Boogie Paleolithic Jarre fare of toe stompin synthesizer anthems. With no concept of sublime codification. Heroic calculated in your face arrangements leave a relatively transient impression. Electric boogie ala francais
1	Misunderstood Not sure what everyone else is upset about. Either you like Collective Soul or you don't. I LOVE this album. It's not a new release in that it's mostly unplugged music. It's without all the bells and whistles and it's still great. I think if you just like CS for their 'Music' you won't like this CD, but if you like them for who they are and their lyrics, it's a great CD. If you want a compilation of greatest hits, try 7 Year Itch, if you want the grass roots, From the Ground Up is for you. IMH
1	Another remarkable album Ignore the previous reviewer because it is full of clarical errors. First off, Houdini was released in 1993, NOT 1995. I don't understand this rambling about the Melvins going downhill in 1995 starting with Houdini. Kurt Cobain was the one who helped the Melvins get on a major label (Atlantic) and it lasted for three albums before they were decided as being too nontradtional and not mainstream accessible. Houdini, Stoner Witch and Stag comprise this era, and all are fine albums worth owning with perhaps Stag being the most unconventional of the three. I don't get how anyone could be critical of the Melvins, because as a whole, they have an impressive body of work that is always expanding and doesn't get pigeon holed in any preconceived notions of genre or labels. Also to dismiss "what ever they have done in the last ten years" without even bothering to listen to it is just plain ignorant. To recap: all Melvins albums are worth owning if you give them a chance The post 1995 work includes Honky (1997) The Magggot (1999) The Bootlicker (1999) The Crybaby (2000) Electroretard (2001) The Collusus of Destiny (2001) Hostile Ambient Takeover (2002) The Pigs of the Roman Empire (2004) And yes even the most recent album with Jello Biafra is worth picking up. Enjoy
0	bor-ring After first buying WR's "Heavy Weather" I'd have to say that this album really disappointed me. Now it does have it's moments(nubian sundance), but all in all, I'm just not feeling this one.I didn't like the sound quality...but it wasnt all about that though. As opposed to "Heavy Weather" Songs like "Cucumber slumber" sound dated...Kinda puts me in the mind of a bad 70's blaxploitation movie, while other songs just plain put me to sleep. Basically it just doesn't have that funky/rock/jazzy sound that Jaco Pastorius brought to the mix.
1	Most bands would give their left arm for an album as good as this This 4th Band album has gotten a bad rap over the years. Only because the first 3 were so legendary. I tell you what, do yourself a favor and listen to this album again, I was amazed how good it really is. With songs like The River Hymm, Life Is A Carnival, Moon Struck One, Shoot Out in Chinatown an dthe underrated Volcano, it's an album most bands would die for to make.
1	Welcome New Additions The new songs in this cd are great additions to the long list of popular Christmas songs. These tracks will endure like the rest of the good ones, and it's well worth getting for your Christmas collection!
1	Journey; Pre-Commercialization These recordings are Journey to me. I was dissappointed when there music took a turn that seemed to represent a desire to make money which exceeded their desire to make music. I am elated to have found this "album". It showcases the genius, soul and spirit which went into their music during that era.
0	missing many songs from the film A soundtrack gets its power from the combination of images with the song. There were a lot of great songs from the movie yet they are not on this lame soundtrack. The soundtrack is okay, the best songs are from Sheryl Crow and Hootie but the songs that are most memorable from the film are missing. I understand that there were probably licensing issues precluding use but that is what makes the soundtrack good...to re-live the euphoria from the film
1	Photek's Masterpiece this is all photek was on his debut, "Modus Operandi", but with some dressing added, if you will. while photek is known for Drum n' Bass, there are 2 house tracks and one ambient track on here that are very worthwhile. The opening track, Terminus starts off with beats like none other and by the time it reaches full swing, youll find yourself wanting more. also be sure to check out the house track Mine to Give featuring the awesome voice of Robert Owens. the title track, Solaris is perfect in every way, and is a real chill out song on a great chill out album which is a necessity for those long trips where you have nothing to do and just feel like tuning out to everything around you. Solaris by Photek is sure to open up new worlds for fans old and ne
0	"-I- AM SPOCK-TACUS!" You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore
1	Public Enemy This was always one of my favorite albums/tapes & I wanted the CD. IT is in great condition. Thanks so muc
0	A Handel Don't My initial reaction on hearing this recording was to deaccession it at once. On better thought, I decided to hold onto it as a striking example of how NOT to sing the music of Handel. Nothing works here: the garbled coloratura, the inept dynamics, the cardboard emotions, the lack of arc. The performances convey no hint of sensitivity. Ms. Fleming's warm voice has been much better deployed in other repertory, like Strauss. But this won't do. Perhaps more distressing than the singing itself is the rabid loyalty of the Flemingites, who obviously consider this singer to be the Second Coming of Callas. This is a discredit to the singer herself, who has remarkable talent and poise and has no need of mindless fans to protect her from her mistakes. To the fledgling singers who admire this recording so much, I would urge a broader scope. A future of Handelian singing in this mold is a very discouraging prospect indeed
1	Nuno's guitar work is very impressive This album beats out a more negative vibe than any of Extremes others, but that doesn't mean that its not enjoyable. The real attraction towards the sound of this album is in the guitar work of Nuno Bettencourt. The intricate rhythms of the guitar solos, made possible by Nuno's shredding abilities, are magic. In some ways I feel his sound bluesy, with an influence of Hendrix. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who it buying their first extreme album, a more rewarding buy would be the best of Extreme: an accidental collication of atoms. I would recommend it to someone looking to expand their Extreme collection however. Particularly impressive songs are Midnight Express, where Nuno shows off his incredible speed on a steel string acoustic, and Hip Today, the guitar solo of which still blows my mind. Also worth mentioning is cynical f***, which isn't as technically impressive but an enjoyable hard rocking song none the less
0	The Worst of Extreme You'd think that after releasing 3 albums, these guys would have honed their craft. Sadly, this album is their worst release. Seems they tried to strip the sound back a bit on this album, fewer guitar overdubs being the obvious change. This album sounds a bit empty to me, I preferred the fuller sound of their earlier releases. The first 3 albums are great. Being a fan of Nuno Bettencourt, I'd also recommend the first Mourning Widows album (the second one is not quite as good)
1	ANOTHER GREAT LIVE COMPILATION BY HENDRIX'S "BAND OF GYPSYS!" I will be doing a review on the legendary historic landmark 2-CD live compilation set entitled "Jimi Hendrix - Band Of Gypsys - Live At The Fillmore East" by the late great guitar legend Jimi Hendrix. As always, I will be editing this review from time to time so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible. In case you haven't read my previous review on the "Band Of Gypsys" DVD documentary, this is actually a continuation review of the "Band Of Gypsys" saga, this time focusing and highlighting on some of Jimi's unreleased song performances that were performed "Live At The Fillmore East" on 31 December 1969 and 1 January 1970. This latest 2-CD set, like the DVD documentary, were both separately released in 1999 and includes additional unreleased song performances that were not included in the original partial six song live compilation released in 1970 entitled "Hendrix - Band Of Gypsys." In case you don't remember, there was another live compilation (a sequel) of additional unreleased performances that was released by Capitol Records on vinyl and cassette in 1986, but not on CD, entitled "Jimi Hendrix - Band Of Gypsys 2." With this new latest 1999 2-CD live compilation collection, along with the original 1970 and the then latest 1986 collection, these new unreleased performances shed a new light in the "Band Of Gypsys" saga and legacy resulting in bringing these partial Fillmore East concerts to life. With this being fact, these newly released performances add much more to the "Band Of Gypsys" legend and is clearly becoming more evident of being a truer testament in showing the further advancement of the band's fully creative side while performing live, in how mixing and combining Rock n' Roll, Soul, R&B, Blues and Funk can result in a new powerfully explosive sound of music. Before I go any further, I would like to go way back to the beginning. In my DVD documentary review, I have stressed many contributing factors on the ideas and beginnings resulting in the birth and formation of the "Band Of Gypsys," along with the many contributing factors and incidents that would fatally prove disastrous and eventually break up the "Band Of Gypsys." In this latest 2-CD release, I will go further and stress another important contributing factor that was not discussed in my previous DVD documentary review. This is another one of many contributing factors that would result in the birth of the "Band Of Gypsys." According to numerous Hendrix biographies and the attached liner booklet that accompanied this 2-CD live compilation set, the genesis, the root of the beginning that started all of this actually evolved from a serious problem Jimi neglected which began back in 1965. In 1965, Jimi was then, a typical hungry musician, who would sign any contract or any piece of paper in hopes that it would further advance his career. Having signed numerous contracts and many pieces of paper to many, unfortunately, for Jimi, there was one piece of paper that Jimi signed that would haunt him after he became famous. Since Jimi did not fulfill his obligations with this particular company, as was the case for the many others Jimi forgot about, the plaintiff's and attorneys representing this opposing company would file a lawsuit against Jimi demanding satisfaction. With this lawsuit pending, Jimi figured that the only way to resolve and settle this lawsuit was to give them something that would satisfy and resolve this issue. With this in mind, Jimi would contact and approach his long time friend and Army buddy named Billy Cox and explained what had happened. It was at this point, when it was decided by Jimi to settle out of court by giving the company plantiff's a new studio album recording for them to release. Cox's reply to this statement was, "lets go for it!" Also during this time, while Hendrix and Cox were discussing these matters further into details, and Jimi's Drummer Mitch Mitchell taking a break in England, Buddy Miles was a frequent visitor as well as a spectator in the studios with Jimi and Billy. When Miles was told about Jimi's misfortunes and his circumstances surrounding his situation, Miles decided the same fate and results as Billy. Miles reply was, "lets help our friend in need." With Jimi sharing and explaining his new ideas for a new sound with Cox and Miles, the two would agree on liking Jimi's new ideas and would help in fulfilling these goals by playing a mixture and a combination of Rock n' Roll, Soul, R&B, Blues and Funk. With these new goals and the stage now being set, this newly born trio would eventually become known as, the "Band Of Gypsys." With Cox's and Miles' full cooperation and their loyalty to Jimi, Jimi now felt a little at ease and believed that a resolution would soon be in the works in his legal matter. In order to create this ultimate new sound for this new album, Jimi elected in preparing fresh new original material. Jimi really wanted to record these fresh new original songs in the studio for the sole purpose, and hopes, of fulfilling his legal obligations to this company by giving them a new studio album recording for them to release, and resolve and close this legal matter. But with the Fillmore East shows coming up, preparations such as practicing and rehearsing the new song material as well as the familiar songs for the upcoming shows, and with little time remaining, would soon become the main priority resulting in the postponement of the studio recordings of the new songs and therefore, laid aside. With Jimi and his Management being harassed and subjected to increasing pressure from the company plaintiff's attorneys, in order to satisfy the Capitol / PPX settlement, a new decision was made by Jimi's Manager Mike Jeffery to record all four of the forthcoming Live Fillmore East Concert Performances. This decision was rendered in hopes of releasing a live compilation album rather than a studio album. With all of this in mind, and showtime about to commence, ALL FOUR concert performances spanning two evenings, were recorded onto tape on 31 December 1969 and 1 January 1970. Sadly, these 2-CD live compilation performances contain only sixteen of the many numerous songs that were performed in those four shows. However, it is also evident that these sixteen live song tracks do clearly audibly indicate and show the brilliance and expertise of some of the new genuine original and well-performed song material besides the regularly well known popular Hendrix songs. These sixteen live song tracks sounded EXCELLENT! The sixteen live song tracks contained and listed in this 2-CD live compilation set are reviewed as follows: DISC 1 (1.) "Stone Free," (1 January 1970, second show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (2.) "Power Of Soul," (1 January 1970, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (3.) "Hear My Train A Comin'," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT WELL PERFORMED slow blues song!) (4.) "Izabella," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (5.) "Machine Gun," (1 January 1970, second show) (one of the very first live recordings of this legendary song. It is a POWERFUL and EXPLOSIVE song WELL PERFORMED! EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING! As I've stressed in my other past reviews concerning this legendary song, I've described this song in this manner; "Jimi actually presents and brings the Vietnam war to the Fillmore East audience crowd resulting in firing rounds of machine gun bullets through his powerfully explosive and violent guitar and ending with an EXCELLENT BREATHTAKING GUITAR SOLO from Jimi.") (6.) "Voodoo Child" (Slight Return) (1 January 1970, second show) (an EXCELLENT VERSION of one of my favorites) and (7.) "We Gotta Live Together." (1 January 1970, second show) (EXCELLENT SONG! WELL PERFORMED!) DISC 2 (1.) "Auld Lang Syne," (31 December 1969, second show) (Well performed the Jimi Hendrix and "Band Of Gypsys" way) (2.) "Who Knows," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING! GREAT SONG!) (3.) "Changes," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (4.) "Machine Gun," (31 December 1969, second show) (another EXCELLENT WELL PERFORMED VERSION. Refer to DISC 1 for my review of the other version of "Machine Gun." My opinions of these two songs are the same. This version is also EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING!) (5.) "Stepping Stone," (1 January 1970, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (6.) "Stop," (1 January 1970, first show) (another EXCELLENT SONG!) (7.) "Earth Blues," (1 January 1970, second show) (another EXCELLENT SONG!) (8.) "Burning Desire" (1 January 1970, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) and (9.) "Wild Thing." (1 January 1970, second show) (the Troggs classic song performed the Hendrix and "Band Of Gypsys" way. an EXCELLENT WELL PERFORMED VERSION!) As story has it, and according to the attached CD liner notes and numerous Hendrix biographies, Technical problems RUINED the two New Years Eve concerts. A malfunctioning microphone at the outset of the first show rendered energetic versions of "Power Of Soul" and "Lover Man" UNUSABLE. Similar problems hampered the start of the second concert set, compromising the fidelity of the "Auld Lang Syne / Who Knows" medley. Nonetheless, these minor trifles made little impact on Jimi and the "Band Of Gypsys." In closing, My DVD documentary review stressed on the MANY main incidents and problems that resulted in disasters and the MANY contributing factors which would lead Jimi into a deep depression and therefore, begin his demise and decline of his health. Sadly, the "Band Of Gypsys" era would prove to be , SHORT LIVED, courtesy of the EVIL CROOKED PLOTTED SCHEMES of Jimi's Manager, Mike Jeffery. It may have also been at this point; (despite all of the incidents and disasters that unfolded in the past, the most recent and the MANY NUMEROUS ones STILL TO COME) that bitter tensions and bad differences would develop, intensify and continually worsen the relationship between Hendrix and Jeffery. Despite all of the tensions and disasters, Jimi Hendrix IS STILL UNDOUBTEDLY, THE GREATEST GUITARIST THAT EVER LIVED. Also, despite being held back and limiting his masterful creativity by Jeffery, Jimi STILL PERFORMED AND PLAYED HIS GUITAR AT A PEAK UNMATCHED BY MANY OF THE GREAT GUITAR LEGENDS. Jimi Hendrix is quite simply, EXTREMELY RARE, UNIQUE AND IRREPLACEABLE. Jimi Hendrix's mark in Rock n' Roll history is FOREVER SECURED. There will NEVER be another Jimi Hendrix. Thanks for your time in reading my long lengthy review and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it for all of you. I also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits. JIMI LIVES! LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL! Rock out always. Take care, J.L.
0	The Sound Quality Really Bugs Me This is a good intro CD to famous piano pieces. However, the sound quality is really *poor*. Of course, what do you expect for the price? I'm sure there are better Piano Sample CDs out there that sound much better. It's worth the extra money, trust me
0	Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....... I remember reading about this album in Rolling Stone. It had 2 stickers on it. It had the usual "parental advisory" sticker (is there a rap album that doesn't) and another one saying "the lyrical content on this album strictly represents the views of the artist" (or words to that effect). The article's main point was asking "are albums going to get two labels now? What's next?". So, my "I hate censorship" side got all flustered, and I went out and bought it. It's a piece of s--t. The beats are boring, and all the lyrics seem to consist of is "my name MC Eiht. No one better mess with me". He pads this wonderfully original thought out to 70 minutes or so, and it gets incredibly tedious. Needless to say, the sticker "controversy" never erupted into anything beyond this album. I just ended buying a really boring album, and I immediately got rid of it.
1	Satisfaction Guaranteed Although Radioactive grabbed the headlines back in 85, 86, Satisfaction Guaranteed is the true gem on the album. It is a terrific song to cover, allows great jamming, and is distinctly Page/Rodgers, a terrific combination (even better than the current Rodgers/May collaboration with Queen). If you haven't heard it in awhile, you may be surprised. Not dated, either
1	VOTED THE GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL ALBUM OF ALL-TIME! I will be doing a review on the legendary masterpiece CD album entitled "ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?" by the late great guitar legend, the one and only Jimi Hendrix. This CD album was originally released on vinyl in 1967 on Jimi's old Reprise Records label affiliated with Warner Brothers and once owned by the late great Frank Sinatra. I own three (3) different versions of this album on CD and the matrix or ID numbers are as follows: 825 416-2, 6261-2 and MCAD-10893. Two of the three CD's I own are definitely COLLECTOR'S ITEMS which I will NEVER SELL. If I hear or read any new information concerning this legendary album, I will edit this review so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible. In my opinion, This album has to rank in the top 10 as one of the GREATEST ALBUMS EVER RECORDED. Mojo Magazine recently held a poll as to what album is the GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME. Guess what, Jimi Hendrix's "ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?" from 1967 won the poll as the GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL ALBUM OF ALL-TIME! This album TRULY DESERVES IT! All the songs listed in this album are G-R-E-A-T! I also noticed that on all three versions I own of this album contain different song tracks or omitted main songs such as "Purple Haze," "The Wind Cries Mary" and "Foxey Lady." These ROCKERS and BALLAD along with "Manic Depression," "Fire," "Can You See Me," "I Don't Live Today" and the Main CENTERPIECE of the album entitled "Are You Experienced?" are all GREAT songs that compliment this album. In my opinion, my favorite songs on this album are "May This Be Love" and "Remember." These two songs are so beautifully crafted and so well written by Hendrix that his emotions flow through his guitar and music resulting in some of the GREATEST MASTERPIECES on this album and in Rock n' Roll history. "May This Be Love" sounds so beautiful, romantic and poetic that you can not help but be absorbed and feel hypnotized by this slow mellow song but POWERFUL! I can talk about all of these songs but it will extend this review into a long review like my previous Hendrix reviews in the past. I highly reccommend this album and is a must and necessity for EVERYONE to own in their music collection. In closing, Jimi Hendrix is the FIRST TRUE GUITAR GOD that has left his mark in Rock n' Roll history and will NEVER be forgotten. His accomplishments in Rock n' Roll as well as the Blues are revolutionary and legendary, there is only ONE Jimi Hendrix that comes along in a lifetime. There will NEVER be another Jimi Hendrix. What a tragic loss for Rock n' Roll. I hope you enjoyed reading my review as much as I enjoyed writing it for all of you. I also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits. JIMI LIVES! LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL! Rock out always and take care. J.L.
0	HE WAS A ONE MAN BAND!!!!! The Songs on this cd show the scope of Wilbert Harrison's career. The &quot;Kansas City&quot; cut is the one that almost everyone is familiar with and is the original FURY recording. The rest of the cuts on this cd were taken from various other companies that Wilbert recorded for from 1960 thru 1972. The cuts that are not included are his FURY/FIRE and SSS International Cuts. If you're looking for the best WILBERT HARRISON package, this is not the one
1	the power and glory of the Huskers If Iggy Pop helped, as he has claimed, "to wipe out the 60s," Bob Mould, Grant Hart and Greg Norton then helped to bring it back. That is, this band managed to expand upon the musical/emotional/cathartic possibilities in high speed hardcore by drawing upon 60s (and 70s) psychedelic and hard rock influences. For instance, elsewhere, the band cover such iconic 60s performers as Donovan (Sunshine Superman) and the Byrds (Eight Miles High). And like the Who's Quadrophenia LP, this too appears to be also a concept album about a young man's alienation from the world around him. Here, such influences abound. For example, Dreams Reoccurring's psychedelic guitar freak out is followed by the absolute hardcore pounding of the great Indecision Time. Hare Krishna - based on the street chant by the well known western Hindu cult - then combines the hardcore, the psychedelic, and the religious even; just listen to Mould's crazy and unbelievable guitar playing on it. And then, a few cuts later, the song Pride. You can practically envision the band levitating off the floor of the recording studio, and it demands that you turn the volume way up, and maybe blow out a window or two to your house, till your neighbors come over, screaming at you to TURN DOWN THE NOISE. And this you cannot do, as you are caught up in a Husker Du trance. Such is the power of this 1984 masterpiece. This then was the record that made me a huge fan of this group, and I will always be convinced that this remains one of rock's classic recordings by one of its all time greatest bands. I have mixed feelings about the idea of a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but given that it exists to enshrine the greats of rock history, I predict that one day Husker Du will be enshrined there, and deservedly so. Current day punk bands, I challenge you all to do anything half as raw and intense as this, I absolutely challenge you!
1	A little more about the sound Not being an "audiophilic" sophisticate I can hardly delve into details of this recording's sound reproduction, but it is not nearly as bad as to make this great performance un-listenable. Quite the opposite, the peculiarities of the sound have deeper reasons behind them. Bach wrote WTK for the keyboard, but in his mind he must have heard them played on a particular instrument. If Gould (whose WTK, IMHO, is his weakest Bach recording) plays it like a harpsichord, or Schiff (another dud) - like fortepiano, every note of Richter's performance echoes with the sound of an organ. I am certain it was deliberate on Richter's part, and the fact that the selected venue of the recording was a church, only confirms that notion. Of course, the church's acoustics did affect the sound, but in a way that was consistent with the artist's conception. As far as the playing itself, there is not much I can add to what has been written by the previous reviewers. Book II, which is somewhat more "abstract" portion of the WTK-48, receives great treatment here, but it is Richter's performance of Book I that stands like a solitary granite peak, high above the clouds, projecting mysterious and purifying force.
0	Too Little, Too Late Although Bad Religion formed in 1980, they seem to fit in with the punk revival scene of the 1990's rather than the original hardcore punk scene. Their first album, "How Could Hell Be Any Worse" which was released in 1982, was dwarfed by the competition in Southern California by such bands as Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, Social Distortion, and the Descendents. In 1983, they released "Into the Unknown," which was an attempt at cheesy progressive rock that was heavy on the synthesizers. That album pretty much ended their relationship with the hardcore community and was such an embarrassment that they won't re-release it. Bad Religion was ignored until 1988 when they released "Suffer" to a new generation of hardcore fans. At that point in time, hardcore punk was pretty much dead and Bad Religion was one of the only bands around at the time playing that style of music, so they were successful without any competition. "Against the Grain" is considered to be the peak of Bad Religion's career. Once again, they were still one of the only bands around playing punk so there wasn't much to compare it to and that was a good thing for them because it's a weak record. The style of punk they play is very pop. The only thing that gives it a punk edge is the speed, but it's not raw and angry like earlier hardcore. Some say the lyrics are very angry, but it's tough to find the anger through the "whoa-whoa-whoas" and "aye-aye-ayes'." There's nothing wrong with using a harmonized and melodic pop rock vocal style, if you don't intend to be taken seriously. The Misfits and the Descendents could pull off the pop vocal style because they generally sung about humorous and outlandish things. Bad Religion sings about serious issues, but delivers it in an upbeat way which really kills any impact their message may have. The music that backs the computer geek sound of the vocals is all about speed and almost seems bouncy at times. "21st Century Digital Boy" is the best song by far, but it's ruined by the vocals. All the rest of the songs basically sound the same. There are plenty of '80's hardcore records out there that are far superior to anything Bad Religion has ever recorded. The '90's revival of punk had nothing new to offer the genre, so go straight to the source and listen to Black Flag, the Misfits, and the Dead Kennedys, who were original and sincere.
0	My Sacrifice -- Listening to this album Ahhh, the long awaited Scott Stapp solo album. The resurgence of Scott Stapp begs the immediate question -- Is there anything Scott Stapp can't do? The answer is invariably YES: sing, write decent songs, or stay out of jail. Lets start with the album cover and the goofy aramaic looking symbol behind him. When loosely translated, the writing reads the phrase "I'm a tool." Though I'll have to give him credit, I was expecting the album cover to be a picture of him nailed to a cross. Instead he went with a tastful picture of himself dressed like a biker and posing like he's being voilated by a [...] thermometer. For all those folks out there looking for that "inspiration" they all seem to find in Stapp's lyrics, I suggest you get some inspiration from the business end of a Lousiville slugger. Maybe then you won't reach out to the psuedo-Christian rocker that got arrested on his wedding day. And I don't even have to mention the video of him and Kid Rock having sex with groupies.
0	ouch my least favorite simon album. the writing is forced and inconsistent. not very good
1	My Favorite The CD I bought is wonderful, new just like described. The David Bowie/Bing Crosby Christmas Song and video, "Peace on Earth" is one of my all time favorites and I am glad I now have it. Thanks much...
1	This chick ROCKS... Saw her on TV Reality show RockStar INEXS...thought she won ...came in 2nd had 2 have more....Think there will B more???? She doesn't need losers like these...anywa
0	Where'd the rock go? Dissapointing after "image of the invisable". The rest of the disc is slow. I understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it, which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd, but I'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another Artist in the Ambulance or Illusion of Safety. Did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album? Maybe the songs will grow on me, but they will never feel like the good old stuff
1	Humble Name, Real Roots Rock Legends The follow-up to the original "best of" NGDB collection, More Great Dirt, consists of more of the 80's country hits during their long career. The NGDB was once a folk and country-rock band, but the majority of the songs on More Great Dirt come from their mainstream country days, which were the most overlooked of their albums. They really had no one big radio hit during this time (except for "Fishin' In the Dark), which hurts this record, as does the fact that it is very overshadowed by the "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" albums that were huge hits. The highlights of the album include the summertime hit "Fishin' in the Dark," Bruce Springsteen's "Cadillac Ranch," and the rocking "Down That Road Tonight." It is too bad that there are only ten tracks here. In my opinion, this isn't up to par with the classic NGDB, but it is still good, quality country and folk. A good purchase if you want an overview of their latter days
0	Not very impressive When I heard that Laura Powers was simular to Loreena Mckennit I rushed to get this cd. I was very disappointed. Laura Powers Has a lovely voice and the songs are good, but she can't compare with Loreena Mckennit and Enya. She lacks Enya and Loreena's surrealistic sound and Loreena's incredable instrumentation. When you Listen to Enya you feel like you have passed part way into the otherworld. When you listen to Loreena you feel like you have stepped back into the ancient world of mystics, Shamens and exotic lands. Laura, although her music is soothing, provides no enchantment. Overall I would not recommend this Cd to anyone
1	Music To Chill Out David Gates wrote some of the most soothing and melodic love songs of the seventies and that voice of his must have melted a lot of female hearts! Although all the best songs of Bread are here, this album would have been more complete if it had included the David Gates classic "Goodbye Girl".
0	Great music ... but buggy Macromedia "special features" The music makes the CD worth getting; however, the so-called special features (i.e., worthless advertising) can ruin your ability to enjoy the music on a computer system. For example, on my computer's CD/DVD player, the buggy software part of the disc makes the music unplayable. On a different drive (a CD/RW), the music portion of the disc can be played; however, at times their annoying Macromedia advertising interface will pop up, sometimes multiple simultaneous copies, stopping the music. And if you kill the advertising "stubs," you can be left with the side effect of an annoying beep whenever you move the mouse pointer over a web link. Please put more tracks of music on CDs -- complete score and songs -- but leave off the bogus "special" features! (And for that matter, I don't appreciate the cutesy attempt on other CDs to "hide" extra music tracks by putting minutes of silence before final tracks. This is especially bad on multi-disc players where you don't want long periods of silence -- at least not until all discs have been played.
0	Not what I was looking for... I was pretty disappointed by this. I was looking for songs that my kids could sing and dance to. This just was not it!! It's too bad, its one of my daughter's favorite movies.
1	Great Product My mother enjoyed this product. I bought it for her as a gift
1	Awesome Strings These are two incredibly talented guys with a passion for playing the violin. The music is very upbeat with a jazzy flair.
0	Better than first album There's a reason you don't know much about his earlier career. If you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60's California band, get QuickSilver Messenger Service first album. At least Sailor had a minor hit (Living in the USA). I would be more lenient if this was the first album. Seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks, but he's got a long way to go. He must have been connected, I would not have let him record another album after the first. But, good thing they did because he was much better in the 70's.
1	Daughter Loves It My daughter received this CD for Christmas. She loves it and plays it at least once a day
1	The best of Art Pepper For new jazz fans or long time Art Pepper fans this is a must-have album. With the backing of Davis' rhythm section Pepper finds his tightest recording. It would have been ideal if they could have mixed in some original material, but this collection of covers really shows Pepper's strength
1	"Another AC/DC triumph" Let There Be Rock is an amazing album filled with smash hits such as "Whole Lotta Rosie" and "Let There Be Rock". And other great songs like "Dog Eat Dog". This is a must-have album for anyone that likes classic AC/DC. 1. Go Down- This song is okay, a pretty good rocker. 7/10 2. Dog Eat Dog- One of my all-time favorite AC/DC songs. It has a catchy beat and a good chorus. 9/10 3. Let There Be Rock- A classic rocker, this song tells the story of how rock came to be. 8/10 4. Bad Boy Boogie- A mediocre song, gets kind of repetitive, but has a good bluesy feel. 7/10 5. Problem Child- A very catchy song, but why did they put it on here again? It was originally on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. 8/10 6. Overdose- This song's kind of filler, but has good guitar. 7/10 7. Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be- Good song, just a plain rocker. 8/10 8. Whole Lotta Rosie- Funny song, and has good guitar. A little disturbing though. 8/10 This AC/DC album is almost like a AC/DC: Greatest Hits, because it has a lot of good songs on it. Definitely something to have in your collection
0	Best CD I purchased since going deaf This is the best CD in my exhausted collection since gong deaf three years ago. My other favorites are &quot;Walking In The Wind&quot; by Marcel Marso, &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; by Helen Keller, and the sound track of &quot;Finding Our Way On Stage&quot;, the concert featuring Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Ronnie Milsap, George Sheering, Diane Shure, Jose Feliciano and Dan Quayle
0	Not good....not good at all... Sorry. I'm as big of a Bowie fan as anyone, but I have to be objective and honest: Bowie's output from 'Let's Dance' through this album, 'Earthling', just flat out sucked. Sure, there were good tracks here and there, but Bowie's heart just seemed to not be in his music. In the '70's, he changed from style-to-style and developed his reputation as a musical chameleon...but COMMITMENT was in each of those recordings. Beginning with 'Let's Dance', it almost seemed as if he felt a need to constantly change to live up to his reputation and keep current and modern, but his head was somewhere else. Take this album. It's supposed to be club music and electronically-disco based, but that style combined with Bowie's Anthony Newley-styled vocals just clash and the overall effect is more irritating than enchanting. The opening track, "Little Wonder", is such an alarming turn-off that it's hard not to turn the damn thing off without listening to the rest of the CD. Thankfully, beginning with his next album, 1999's 'Hours', Bowie seemed content to accept his past, his legend and his legacy without having to jump aboard every musical trend that pops up. The result has been three excellent albums in a row ('Hours', 'Heathen', and 'Reality')
1	A FINE ASSORTMENT TO THE NU-SOUL, LOVER , THIS IS THE COMPILATION TO HAVE, GOOD ASSORTMENT OF TRACKS THAT COVERS THE GENRE. CHOKLATE IS ONE MY FAVORITE ARTIST ON THIS LABEL BE SURE TO CHECK HER OUT
1	Excellent mix of everything - all your needs get met... This CD is excellent. It's a soulful mix of jazz, hip hop, and R&B. Kajmere is a distribution company on the west coast turning out indiesoul, hip hop, dance, and indierock. They typically turn out 12" releases - most of these cuts are from these releases. And, this is exactly how this music sounds to me - underground, like hidden treasure - each track. From Adriana Evans' "Remember the Love", to N8E's "Tread Lightly" and "Rock On", to all of DJ Tonks' tracks, to Presto and LOWD's "Back in 92", to "Love" by the Globetroddas, this CD is an outstanding soulful representation of where I hope music continues to go. Buy it - you won't be disappointed.
0	Shadow Wolf The most irrattating piece of music I've purchased in a long time. I was glad to sell it . The phrasing made previous favorites annoying. I don't think I'll be buying any more of her music unless it's for resale on the web
1	Dan's Still The Man!!!!!! I remember seeing Dan Fogelberg in concert when I was about 15 or 16 years old. Awesome! After seeing him in concert, I became a fan! The power of his music and song have deeply touched me! Everytime I hear &quot;Leader of the Band&quot;, I am moved. It's such a heartfelt tribute to his father. Every picture tells a story--and Dan tells a fine story behind each song. To sum this album in five words or less: Beautiful and Relaxing
1	Saxophone, Bass and Drums make a great Trio. Sonny Rollins, Ray Brown and Shelly Mann are all superb on this 71 minute album. It comprises 6 tunes; three of which have alternate takes added as bonus tracks. The originals and alternates are similarly compelling. Although my personnal favourite is Wagon Wheels, all 9 tracks are excellent. The uncanny sense of space and the Western mood created by the trio make the cd great listening. I am a big fan of Sonny Rollins and his happy, muscular, witty, rich and edgy sound. This album sees all three musicians in marvellous form, with the rhythm section brilliantly creating the illusion of movement. I would recommend this as THE album to buy to begin a Sonny Rollins collection. No words can adequately describe the treat that awaits you; however some may point in the right direction. They are; lyrical, witty, warm and imaginative. Way Out West is most original and is one of my favourite cds.
0	Not good, but not entirely bad. I bought this cd online but realized soon afterwards that it was hard to listen to...but Heavenbound was so impressive I cannot give it a bad rating. First of all, of course it's bad! It was their first cd, it was the late '80s and Kevin was not a prominent member. But rewind, give them grace and see how far they've come, and you'll appreciate how they started out, however bad it was. However, I see no reason for anyone but a die-hard fan to buy this cd. Compared to the other incredible selection of Christian music that is out now, it's a pitiful little dot in the corner. But it signifies the start of successful Christian rap/hip hop, so it's pretty interesting as far as Christian music history goes. But like I said, it's not worth it if you don't know the group. Don't "start here", and in fact, don't even really end here. It's more interesting than "good". Overall, it's not the greatest...but if you think it's worth the buy for Heavenbound, then do it, because the song is really lyrically great
0	If you're a fan of the band, skip it I bought this CD for a few bucks a while ago at a Christian music store. The next day I brought it back. I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect it to be horrible. This is early '90s rap. We're talking really bad here. Like, Vanilla Ice/Ninja Rap-bad. They had to start somewhere, but if you want my advice, skip this and go to the good stuff - Supernatural, Jesus Freak, etc
0	...and so it begins remember when green day was hot back in 1994, and in the years to come, a million and one soundalikes would come along? well, it's happening again, this time with the band fall out boy. fall out boy got huge around 2003 when their hit single "grand theft autumn" exploded onto the music scene and put "take this to your grave" on everyone's "amazon favorite list". in 2004, the band signed with major-label "island", and has proved to be one of the labels most successful acts. weeks on end with number 1 singles, thousands of records sold (millions of downloads) and a massive following could only bring one thing; the clones. june is "victory records" first attempt to cash in on fall out boy mania, with a manic post-punk sound and stump-esque vocals. although they aren't exactly a carbon-copy, the influence is too blatant, and that alone makes it highly passable. nothing new here folks, just fall out boy on a smaller scale. on a quick side-note, victory has just released another record from a band called "the audition". this band sounds even MORE like fall out boy, and their instant popularity means that june will probably have to take the backseat for a little while. get something more original instead...
0	disappointing i should have previewed the selections on this collection more closely. the quality of the recordings is fair to poor and the actual selections are uninspiring, considering the wealth of classics generated during this period of history. in sum, there are much better anthologies out there than this one
1	Great Great album, but what is the song at the end credits? I love that song
1	What a fabulous album I'm not going to say too much other than ...WOW ... what a fabulous album - this is one that you can jut belt out anywhere - I love it
1	Best CD Ever Borrowed I Had heard of Unearth before as one of the best Hardcore/Metal bands around. When I had the Opprotunity to borrow their album Stings of Conscience from a good friend, I immediately took the initiative. I Had been hearing this album while in my homies' ride, and I was hooked after the second song(One Step Away) when I heard that insane guitar. Then the crazy drums, and the screaming, and everything else it was pure mayhem. This has to be my new favorite Band. I Can't wait to see them live. This is the best free CD I had ever recieved. I recommend that you go out and buy this album to support this great band. I plan to buy more albums from them too. \\m/
1	DAZ'S BEST ALBUM EVA!! To everyone that wasn't feelin Daz on "Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP" (including me)--this album has a completely different sound. The title is kinda lame, but it duz spell out what this album is all about. When Daz left Cali for the South, it seemed as if he finally sold out... this could not be further from the truth. "Gangsta Crunk" is 100 timez more gangsta and on-point than anything that has come out of the West for the last few years. Daz crushes The Game and Snoop with this release, even outdoing his classic debut, "Retaliation, Revenge, and Get Back." Don't let the title fool you--"Gangsta Crunk" doesn't feature any dumbazz Lil-Jon type hooks, only bombazz beats & hardcore lyrics. The best cutz are "I'm Looking for Dat Gangsta Bit*h," "A License to Kill," "We Mean Bizniz," and "Tow Up from Tha Flo' Up"--the latter two both being classics. Props to Daz for turning his career around; can't wait for the Dogg Pound Reunion album
1	Incredible EP Let me just say that Joe Satriani is in opinion the best guitar player/musician in the world, and to be able to see him live is an unforgettable experience. Dreaming #11, and Disc 2 of Time Machine are as close as you can get to experiencing Satch live. The highlight on this disc has to be the live recording of Memories, it's almost double the length of the studio version and a hundred times better (although the studio version is still a very moving piece of music). If you are any kind of Satriani fan, or guitar enthusist pick up this album, you won't regret it
1	Long time listener to Van Morrison This CD is a great collection of early to recent more early Van Morrison. I bought the album primairly for the Song "Cleaning Windows", but foung many more favorits on this album after purchasing it
1	Catchy, heavy songs with a wide range of vocals At one time, I was pretty much a sucker for all nu metal that was kinda underground and wasn't out for the money. Now, I find myself listening to few bands, such as Fear Factory, Type O Negative, and Machine Head. I've pretty much abandoned all the other guys. So why does switched fit in? Because they pull off emotion in great variety and it's not simply sounds battering your ears. Along with these guys I definitely recommend From Zero, who can be compared to these guys except more on the melodic side
1	The debut of arguably the greatest American rock band ever It was in June of 1972 that classic rock legends The Eagles released their self-titled debut album, which was a great blend of pop, rock and country. Drummer Don Henley, bass player Randy Meisner, guitarist Bernie Leadon and guitarist/keyboardist Glenn Frey would finally have the chance to prove to the world that they were musical geniuses whom not only could play well but sing so well with harmonies that were flawless after first playing together in legendary country/rock/pop singer Linda Ronstadt's backing band and after they finished the tour with Linda she blessed the guys to break out on their own and the band didn't forget her and she subsequently signed to Asylum thanks to The Eagles' success. The band has since this debut became the best-selling American band of all time, and is also one of the Top 4 ahead of Pink Floyd and behind only Led Zeppelin and The Beatles. This debut album was produced and engineered by Glyn Johns, the same man responsible for engineering albums by The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Faces and The Beatles among others. The heavily country-influenced Take It Easy opens this stellar album and was a great intro to The Eagles. The rock classic Witchy Woman follows and was the world's intro to Henley's voice which would become more dominant in later albums(he would also sing the rocking Nightingale). The rocking Chug All Night follows and has superb vocals from Glenn. Randy steps out in front for the ballad Most of Us Are Sad which is a great song. The aforementioned Nightingale follows and is a great rocker. The second half kicks off with guitarist Bernie's country tinged Train Leaves Here This Morning and is a great song. The countryish-rocker Take The Devil is chilling with a great Meisner vocal. The country-ish Earlybird follows and has Bernie on vocals and just is a great number. The slower but still excellent tune Peaceful Easy Feeling follows and was the album's other hit single. The album closes with the rocker Tryin which was one of Randy's best vocal performances. This album has held up well and this was the last Eagles album I bought in 1991 when I was 15 on cassette and regretted not acquiring it earlier as I thought the album would stink aside from the three singles which are on the various best ofs(Take it Easy, Witchy Woman and Peaceful Easy Feeling). This album is a classic and is highly recommended!
0	very very poor I waited for over a month and a half. To be so dissapointed in this Cd. I love jazz tributes and even Gerald himself would be lost on this one. No smooth grooves and surely could use a touch of jazz vocalists also. The tribute to Luther is something that the producers of this Cd needs to listen to and get a few lessons from it. not even deserving of a sta
1	It's delirious. This is a very strange album. It features a lot of imaginative sonic "experiments". Such as instruments recorded at half speed or double speed, and then played back at normal speed. Also vocals or instruments recorded backwards and then played forwards. It's all way ahead of it's time, and it should be of interest to anyone who likes unusual music
0	FAKEY-*Fake Live Album Alert* Not only is this a bad representation of AC/DC Live, (They only opened up with Riff Raff during the brief POWERAGE tour and who cares about Rock N Roll Damnation, live anyway), but this is a fake live album. Judging by many of the alternate live recordings available, AC/DC just never sounded like this live, its all doctored up, the crowd noise is fake (listen to the "Fweep" of the tape machine being turned off at the end of "Whole Lotta Rosie", a glaring mistake and proof of the fakiness. Not a horrible album, Hell aint a bad place and problem child are pretty good, but where is Live Wire? Rocker was'nt available yet in the USA either which just makes it all the more confusing. Proof that Bon Scott Ac/Dc album can .... PS: Let there be Rock and FLick of the switch are the best Ac/DC albums..
0	Infuriating! The biggest idiots I've ever heard except for Rappers of course. This is a band that could have been a great band if it wasn't for the goofy vocalist botching and making a joke out of everything. The musicianship is definately there, excellent musicianship, but comic book lyrics and vocals trash it all! After a few songs of this, the humor gets old real quick. It's sad to see such gifted Southern musicians live up to an outdated stereotype played out by a childish vocalist who thinks all of life is a joke. If it wasn't for this, and they had gotten a real vocalist to sing the songs seriously, they probably would have been as big as Lynyrd Skynryd, and their musicianship gives strong evidence of what should have been, instead of them being reduced to dime store novelty status! Thank god that Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, and Molly Hatchett got it right, and did the South proud with some dignity
1	One of my favorite recordings! I am not a fan of the &quot;sound of a countertenor or male alto.&quot; I stumbled upon this recording &amp; cannot stop listening to it and recommending it to friends. Scholl's voice is not &quot;plummy&quot; but strong and vibrant and filled with colors. I would love to see and hear him in person-perhaps an opera if this is where he wants his career to go. I am a fan &amp; have just purchased 3 more of his cd's
0	Dual Disc CD won't play in many CD players How idiotic. So far this CD ONLY plays on my computer. I have 4 other CD players, one of which I bought ONE MONTH ago and the CD will not play. On the back of the CD there is small print saying that "the audio side does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players". Maybe Amazon needs to make that very obvious in the writeup on the CD. I pay my money for the music legally and I can't listen to it. I am not likely to pay return shipping on it to Amazon b/c it isn't worth the effort or money. I feel pretty ripped off. Now I'll have to COPY it onto a CD to listen to it.
1	tbs's best, easily there will always be a special place for this album in the hearts of tbs fans. it is easily their best-ive been listening to it for years. i dont know whats happening to the band now (with their crappy "louder now" album), but i will always love this cd. get it if you havent already, i promise youll like it
1	Fun album of mostly new material This is probably the best of the Spongebob CD's released to date. It has a cute radio-station theme that is woven in between the songs. Though the first few songs are just repeats of previous albums, there are a number of great new songs. So the CD is worth the money. Parents be aware that there are two songs that deal with "mature" subjects in a childish way (dealing with underwear and saying bad words). Overall a fun album
0	Not Horrible, But Not Great Either I won't say this was a horrible CD because it wasn't, it's just when you've heard enough good Bass 'n Nova/Jazzanova albums, you will realize that this album cannot compare to the others that are out there on the market. Most of the songs on this album don't grab your attention the way they do on really great albums (and you all know what I mean - you know that feeling when you pop in a CD for the first time and just get hooked by the addictiveness of a great album? - well folks that's what I'm talking about). Unfortunately this album failed to deliver that effect. It's too bad because the artwork on the cover is really nice, not to mention the fact that Putumayo usually puts together an enjoyable, reliable series of world music. The inside of this CD also has a booklet which tells you a little bit about the artists and the songs, which is always nice to know. Having been an avid listener of Brazilian music my entire life, I am enjoying the transition of old meets new in Brazilian electronic music. It doesn't have the annoying, frantic beats that American techno/trance music has. Rather it is a simple, but truly enjoyable blend of samba and bossa nova mixed with modern and futuristic electronica dance beats and sounds. However if you really want to find out more about this new wave in Brazilian music, I would recommend checking out another album. Although this album has a decent lineup of new Brazilian electronic Bass 'n Nova/Jazzanova artists, it doesn't take advantage of showcasing any of their good songs
0	Only imitation of great art I used to own this cd and I thought it was absolutely groundbreaking and a wonderfully creative release from Mike Patton and Co. However, I just bought Torture Garden by Naked City. The fact is, Naked City was doing this exact same stuff over 10 years ago! I could not believe that art like this came out back then! Don't get this cd, it is Patton ripping off John Zorn's brilliance. Get Torture Garden instead. It is much more daring for its age and actually just sounds much better, fuller. Mike Patton is mosly ridding the inspirations of other artists
1	His overall best! While I was kind of slow to get this because of his use of beats that I heard before on "Smooth operator" and his second R&B release "I get the Job Done," other singles like "Calling Mr. Welfare" and "Another Victory"(some of THE illest flows ever in a rap record!!!), I had no choice but to get it. While he was in the process or abandoning Marley Marl (for a lack of gong platinum like he felt that he should have. He wanted to be the next LL and could have been...), this album turns out to be better (overall) than his first one because he has more songs on it. The songs are good and the beats are hot although some songs use beats that we have heard beofore. In order to understand (young people and those new to hip-hop) why the Big Daddy Kane and Rakim are mentioned as THE best while they are not seen or heard from, you have to get their first two albums. If you don't understand then, you never will. If you think that Tupac was a great MC or that Tupac and/or Biggie were the greatest of all time, then you would hate on this album because you listened during a time of simplistic lyrics and a persona(and looks.Tupac) that sold in instead of real skills. If you hear this and you cannot say that BDK and Rakim are THE best rappers ever, then you judge rappers by how much violence they bring and how much crap they talk. NONE of these rapper can even compare to one paragragh by BDK on this album. He alomst took LL's spot after that Kool Moe Dee battle almost did LL in (they 'forgot' to mention that on "Behind the Music..."), but after LL came out with "To the Break of Dawn" and "jingling Baby," LL was back on top. BDK. A man who ruined his own career. I still can't get over it..
0	Good performance, antiquated recording My kids and I have much enjoyed this recording, but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled. Moreover, the narrator speaks with a British accent, making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones. In general, I have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings, so I'm now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music
0	Musically weak - later work is far stronger Having really enjoyed 'You've come a long way baby' - one of my favorite albums - I had high hopes for this work, after all, they are just a year or two apart. Oh, was I disappointed. Perhaps if one were thrashing around at a rave party while out of their gourd on X, then this album would sound a little better, but stone cold sober I really had a hard time with this ensemble. The constant looped samples just repeat and repeat seemingly, in some instances, for ever. I see this album almost as a test case for Cook's later - and musically far better - work. One can really see the roots here of how this style and sound was massaged and refined into something much more musically coherent with 'You've come a long way baby'. Song For Lindy stands out as one of the more tolerable tracks along with Going Out of My Head, Everybody Needs a 303 and Michael Jackson. The guitar riff in Santa Cruz never seems to stop and gives me a headache while the lyrics in Give a Po' Man a Break could do exactly that. The rest of the tracks are evidently an exercise in how to use a sequencer and are apparently written to cram as many repeated samples into each song as possible. I really wanted to like this album, but it offers little of redeeming quality; quite simply it's dull. Ultimately, there is just not enough here to warrant its purchase
0	This sucks bigtime What the hell is this crapola? The real Misfits were not about lame as* bullsh*t! Like everyone else says, what you usually hear without Danzig has lost it's edge. They lost their edge. What's the point of making music and calling yourself the Misfits when you're really not changing anything? Punk is about change. Change is usually edgy, this is honestly far from that. The Misfits changed music - they had their own sound, they were original, and nobody else had that sound. I'm saying this about alot of other bands. We're not Danzig heads, we're not kissing as*. The Misfits truly lost their edge. We're not expecting every band to always sound the same - but at least create newer and edgier music because nowadays every band sounds the same. It's all up to the original bands to influence everybody, and when you're making music that doesn't influence anyone, what's your point - money?
0	Noise!!!!!!!! Although the last couple of years I mainly listen to jazz from The phenomenal period of music between the early 1950's and late 1960's, I am continually amazed at the abundance of quality output. The Blue Note re-issues of works by Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Grant Green, Larry Young, Hank Mobley, Art Blakey and Blue Mitchell to just name a few are true musical expressions of a fine art. But Ascension by Coltrane is noise and certainly does not fit in with the works of the above artists which represented great musical milestones. Only his early stuff can really be classed as music.
1	The Hits And More If you are looking for the hits of Billy Joel, this is the place. All of his major hits are here and in one place. There are no live cuts, no alternate takes, just song after song from one of the best musicians of the last 30 years. If you have some of his other CDs, you may quibble about some of the choices on the set. For example, I have a soft spot for "Leave A Tender Moment Alone" and that is not here. But that is minor. The 4th CD in this set is a gem, from his talks on the "business" of music, how records actually do get made. You get a feel for Joel as a person as he talks about growing up as he explains how and why he wrote songs such as Scenes, Vienna and Piano Man
1	Doris Day - Greatest Hits -- You can't help but love this CD I never even knew that I was a fan of Doris Day until I heard one of her songs in a recent popular movie. I bought the 'Greatest Hits' album, thinking the song would be on there, and it wasn't. It didn't matter - because I fell in love with the album anyway. I was never a fan of 'Fifties' music, however, this album has a timeless quality that anyone could love. It makes you feel like you should be in a dimly-lit night club with some brandy, a fine cigar, and a beautiful woman sitting atop a black baby grand. Enjoy
1	ONJ at her best Wow, what a trip back in time! As I listen to this album, I am immediately transported back to my brother's car, listening to Olivia scream like a banshee on "Please don't keep me waiting". Certainly, the cover art, along with the release of "Grease" earlier that same year (1978), made an impression on my 13-year old mind - but now that I'm a mellower, 41 year old, I still am astounded by the quality of this album. Great music, track after track. My personal favorites are "Please don't keep me waiting", "Borrowed Time", "Dancing round and round", and "Boats against the Current". As for "Boats", Eric Carmen should be very pleased with the fine treatment that Olivia gave this beautiful song of his. Sadly, as of my writing this in Nov, 2006, the CD is STILL ONLY AVAILABLE AS AN IMPORT - what a miscarriage of justice! Anyway, it's worth the effort to secure a copy - thanks to Amazon for making it available
1	The Best What a great return from a group that bent the 80's on their ears, video masters! Solo or together, they rock the world and always will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Danny mmetuchek@hotmail.co
1	Wonderful Songs I'm with Stephen. 30 years of listening, and this album gets better all the time. "Marie" is fabulous. Of course, Randy's work in general is fabulous. Don't let the title put you off. Tho
1	Finally! I've waited for what seems to be an impossibly long time for Cory Morrow's new CD, and it's been well worth the wait. There's only one word I can come up with to describe this album -- AMAZING. I couldn't be prouder to call myself a fan of Cory
1	Haunting, evocative, achingly beautiful If you like Gorecki and Part, you will want to buy this cd. As a classical music fan with widespread interests, I have placed this on my favorites shelf. It is deeply spiritual, tuneful, and interesting.
1	Listen to the Dramatics at their best! I recently purchased this CD, what can I tell you it was like tasteing vintage champagne. I wanted more,the only negative was they left out my favorite Dramatics song life of the party. Otherwise a great cd Just shopping not buying, if your not a fan this song will seal the deal. The intro alone is worth the price of the cd and Ron Bank's falsetto(unbelieve able). My recommendation buy it now
0	How dissapointing I find it hard to believe that the same band who put out the heavy metal classic "Burn My Eyes" and the strong follow-up "The More Things Change", would suddenly sink into the nu-metal trash. To be honest, most nu-metal that I actually like, I wouldn't buy a CD from(the nu-metal CDs I do have are from my nu-metal phase). The awesome riffs, the cool solos, the sweet drumming, and a band who had a message about society have been pushed aside here for power chords, rapping, and self loathing lyrics. I gave this 2 stars because I like 2 or 3 songs on here, but one of those 3 songs is a cover. When I saw the music video for "From this Day", it almost made me want to slap Rob in the face. He went from a tall, powerful metalhead to a stupid, trendy, spiky-haired w igger. They would get worse on "Supercharger", but thank god that Machine Head recovered on "Through the Ashes of the Empires". This is not a good place to start for Machine Head at all. Get their first 2 albums and their new one to hear Rob and the gang as a post thrash/groove metal powerhouse, not a nu-metal slump
1	stellar performance Even if I were not the photographer who contributed the cover photos I would rate this album as a ten. For this release, SONiA has cooked up a band of incredible talent and passion which drives her songs to a whole new level of glory. An added bonus is sister CiNDY's vocals on the Kerrville tracks which connect this recording to the past of disappear fear. This new incarnation of disappear fear rocks and its sound can only go up from here. It is as spontaneous and as fixed in time as SONiA's smile on the cover. Gotta love this one
0	Poor Effort This is not a good product for someone as talented as Dr. Smith. Poor arrangements and uninspired playing. Saving the CD somewhat are the tunes Trouble Man, Willow Weep For Me and Freedom Jazz Dance

1	Marc anthony is the man! Marc anthony is the man.I love this cd infact,as I am writing this I am listening to "I need you" one of the songs from the cd.This cd gets a 10/1
1	Love that Anthony! Marc Anthony sings with so much love and passion that it's hard to stop listening once you play this CD. I really like his music a lot. Every word is meaningful and intuned with such deep feelings. The way he sings about love makes me want to fall in love. This is another great album of his
1	Wonderful Album One of my favorite albums ever. I've had it for years and still love it. Teenager of the Year is also good
0	The time of our lives I love Il Divo but very disappointed with this CD. It's very short and a repeat of songs in previous releases
1	In its way recalls Mr John Coltrane's A Love Supreme The impression I'm left with from this fine music is that Mr Lloyd has come to terms with ...life? ... Art? ...God? With two thirds of the Brad Mehldau trio (youth) balanced by masters Mr Billy Higgins and Mr John Abercombie(experience) there is absolutely no sense of strain. The water might be wide but it is also deep. The spirituality and sense of communion and peace that suffuses this music is apparent in the verse, the programming and packaging of this CD. It opens with one of the most poignant of Mr Hoagy Carmichael's songs - GEORGIA - and who can fail to recall the emotional baggage that song carries, not the least of which is its interpretation by Mr Ray Charles. There is a homage to Ms Billie Holiday in a song by the leader called LADY DAY. There is Mr Strayhorn's LOTUS BLOSSOM and Mr Ellington's BLACK BUTTERFLY. It seems as though Mr Lloyd is paying homage to the roots of the music - spirituals, folk songs,the blues, pain, love and the black experience - through some of its major progenitors including the great bassist Mr Cecil McBee whose SONG OF HER is included. This is not to say the music is lacking in joy. FIGURE IN BLUE with its spritely rhythms is one case in point. LOTUS BLOSSOM too is liltingly, swingingly lovely. Mr Lloyd's tenor can sometimes sound as sweet as an alto but throughout there is a quiet, thoughtful, passionate and masterful musician at work here completely supported in his vision for this programme of music by his musicial compadres. In this music I am reminded of John Coltrane's A LOVE SUPREME, David Murray's SPIRITUALS and Mr Duke Ellington's inclination towards the sacred
1	bath time and candle light Had a crappy day? need to relaxe? start the bath water and light the candles. Set this CD up and you'll have a better night ahead of you. Start with track #1 move on to track #3,9,11,12 then on to 14. You'll feel so much better!!! I have this whle collection and this is one of my favorite compilations. I hated Chillout 06 and was dissapointed in 05 but 02-04 are safe bets!! go with the flow and CHILLOUT
1	Amazing piece of music This opera is absolutely amazing. I used it to help process the grief that I experienced due to the death of my closest Aunt. It worked
1	A classic rock album brought down by poor sound quality THE BAND: Ian Gillan (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums & percussion). THE DISC: (1970) Originally 8 tracks long clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. This digitally remastered (UK) version released in 1995 adds 12 bonus tracks bringing the total listen to just over 78 minutes. This is the band's 4th album. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/time/credits, numerous photos (some unreleased); a brief insight to the making of and happenings during the time the album was made - by Roger Glover and (writer) Simon Robinson (with quotes from Gillan and Lord as well); and the discography of "In Rock" in various countries. Label - EMI Records. COMMENTS: After purchasing the "Machine Head" and "Fireball" deluxe anniversary packages... I couldn't wait to get my mitts on "Deep Purple In Rock". Every song is a fast paced rocker here with the exception of the ten minute "Child In Time" - one of my favorite slow rockers... and one of Gillan's many highlights vocally, as well as Lord's wonderful slow intro and Blackmore's guitar solo once the song picks up. For some reason, I was thinking Roger Glover cold fix the original tapes and make these songs sound like they were recorded last year. Not so. The sound is still as muddy as ever. In many places, Ian Paice's cymbals & hi-hat are non-existent. Lord's organ/keyboards are mixed so poorly at times it's tough to distinguish between his high notes and Blackmore's high notes. Disappointing to say the least - it still sounds like a.m. radio. I grew up with Deep Purple and I have 17 of the discs. "In Rock" was easily not my favorite, but it was definitely top 5 due to great songs like "Black Night", "Speed King", "Flight Of The Rat" and "Child In Time" (check out the live version of this song on "Made In Japan"... I'll go out on a limb and claim it's better than the studio version here). "Black Night" and "Speed King" made it to most of their greatest hits compilations, while "Child In Time" made it to a few. The bonus tracks are a plus. Though the sleeve will have you salivating at "12" bonus tracks, it's really only "6". The other "6" are intro's to each song lasting on average 20-30 seconds each. Various chit-chat and Blackmore fooling around on his guitar. These 6 bonus songs sound great... slightly different, and much improved sound over the original 8 tracks. 2 of the tracks are unreleased - "Jam Stew" and "Cry Free"... both treats! Two bonus versions of "Speed King", and an unedited remix of "Black Night" are the highlights. In my opinion, the back photo is very telling... Glover is front and center and the backbone of the band - perhaps the glue keeping the 5 members together (knowing how Blackmore and Gillan got along). For me, this is a very good album, but the poor sound quality keeps me from rating it any higher. The lone track "Child In Time" and the bonus songs make this a must-have disc
1	A satisfying musical journey Over the years I've gotten weary of people ragging on Mingus because it doesn't meet their expectations - it doesn't sound like Joni Mitchell should, it doesn't sound like Mingus would have wanted it to, it doesn't sound like jazz should, etc., etc. Listeners should get over all that and appreciate it for what it is - a challening, beautiful, eclectic, and even mystical musical journey. It's holding up beautifully all these years later.
1	Leave the light on I couldn't think of a better title for my review, listen to the the song and I think you will agree. Chris Smither gets better with every cd that he makes. He has a sound of his own and sees and hears life through a very unique perspective. There is not a cut on this cd that I don't like. Try it you want be disapointed
0	Cute -- but the packaging is better than the music A lot of the performances are horrid, some of the arrangements are insipid. There ended up being about 30 tunes and songs here that were of interest--and over 100 that I'll never listen to again. In many ways, it's a beautifully packaged vanity project of limited interest musically.
0	Music to listen to while watching whales die In the 1970s and 1980s I bought most of the ECM catalog as albums were released. This was the first one I actually hated. I also hated Jan Garbarek's &quot;Afric Pepperbird&quot; but was already a Garbarek fan from &quot;Dansere&quot; and &quot;Witchi-Tai-To&quot; and if I had listened to &quot;Afric Pepperbird&quot; first, I might never have bought other Garbarek albums, as I have never purchased another Stanko recording. It is common to comment on a trumpet player's technique, but Stanko has none upon which to comment. For reference, my preferred trumpeters are Kenny Wheeler and Roy Hargrove
0	A very disappointing follow-up to his first CD. I have Schimmel's first CD, &quot;Comes Clean,&quot; which is absolutely hilarious. So, I ordered this CD and waited for it to arrive with much anticipation. As soon as I received it, I couldn't wait to listen to it with my husband, also a fan of the first CD. Unfortunately, we barely snickered throughout the entire CD. Maybe because his style was no longer new to us
1	When my mind is numb playing tricks on me and the world is crashing... I'll start off with the thing that will get me unhelpful votes, but it needs to be said. I've heard very few songs by KMFDM so my introduction to Lucia came in the form of Revolver Magazine. Without ever truly hearing her voice I decided to get From The Land Of Volcanos. That was nearly a month ago and this CD is still in heavy rotation. This has been one of those CDs to escape with. For the 54 and some odd second running time, you're in a completely different place. Lucia's voice and the lush melodies sweep over you and you lose all sense of time. Few CDs do that so to find one that does it, and so successfully at that, is quite the relief. Whether the song is of the harder variety or just as relaxing as can be, at no point does this record stall, it moves swiftly, which is, ironically, my only gripe with it as well. From the very beginning of So Clever I figured I was in for quite a ride. So Clever is just a solid song, nothing more. Breathy vocals through the verses turn into an ear catching chorus. I Don't Care has some of the best lyrics on the disc, plus the chorus pretty much soars. Fear is a lyrically driven song. It serves as a true highlight as well. Feels Like Summer is probably my second favorite featured. 'Instant classic' comes to mind whenever I hear it. A pulsating beat with some pretty intense moments only serve the song more justice. What You Become has a NIN feel to it with a repetative chorus, not my favorite but good for a few listens. Who Asked You creeps along with a certain sensuality to it. I Will goes down as my favorite song featured. The chorus is irresistable, that's basically what it boils down to. Monkey Puzzle Tree kind of grated my nerves at first but now I really like it. Nice lyrics and excellent chorus. Ordinary Girl rounds out the true CD nicely. The chorus is kind of eery due completely to Lucia's vocals. I love the pace of this song. The KMFDM verson of Monkey Puzzle Tree strikes me as more of a reprise than a remix. Either way, it's still a great song. My favorite songs are So Clever, Fear, Feels Like Summer, I Will, and Ordinary Girl. If you're like me and haven't been properly introduced to Lucia, well this is the perfect way. This CD is truly amazing and I can only hope that when I venture into KMFDM's catalog that they'll impress me as much as Lucia has with From The Land Of Volcanos
0	GET THE ITALIAN VERSION! This is a great CD...in its original language!!! NEK is an Italian singer. I'd love to buy this CD, but not in a spanish cover
1	COMPELLING With its flavorful mix of new and original music (but sadly lacking the poignant Laura Nyro songs that made the movie so emotionally resonant), this disc is absolutely worth listening to -- and it has a power all its own. Recalling the sweetly, deceptively simple movie, it has a folky, sublime, melancholy quality
1	Excellence This is the best CD I have heard in a long time. Even some bums on the street heard me listening to it in my car and just had to ask what it was. R.L Burnside and Lyrics Born are a unique and fabulous collaboration
0	A compilation.... Make a mix of Michael's first two solo albums (Michael Schenker Group and MSG), add UFO's &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; and that's the set list for this live album recorded in Japan. So, the utility of this album is in accord with your preference for live albums or not, because, if you already own hhis first two albums, this album is utterly superfluous. At least the line up is the same of MSG: Barden, Michael, Glen, Raymond and POwell, and they deliver with their customary high skills and professionalism
0	Doesn't work Sorry, this cd just isn't all that and I went and bought it based on the fact that I love Book of Shadows and read the reviews. BLS earlier stuff is awesome, and I'm into skynyrd and allman bros. and other southern rock as well as heavier music so I thought I'd like this. I don't, it doesn't work. Zakk's singing on this just pushes me away, or not sure what it is but the cd sounds like he wants to be Bob Seger - which IMO is NOT a good thing. Get Book of Shadows, which is excellent, or if you want other mellow metal from Zakk - Hangover Music Vol 6 blows this one away too.
1	Hidden Gem Background: His first five Warner Bros. Records with the original group are 5 stars to me. Then came "Welcome to my Nightmare" (another 5 star in my opinion). "Goes to Hell" slips to four stars, "Lace and Whiskey" slips to two stars, and then he just falls off the radar screen. "From the inside" is more of a Vince Furnier record, "Flush the Fashion" opens strong with a cover of "Talk, Talk" and then "Clones" before the album falls to pieces. "Special Forces" seems totally phony. Then, out of nowhere with the worst (or best) album cover I've ever seen, he delivers "Zipper Catches Skin." This album features the familiar guitar sound of Dick Wagner. The music sounds like vintage Alice (with an 80s edge). But, there's something else here. His vocals have confidence again!! His lyrics are silly, but clever again. The guitar has bite...the album has genuine attitude. That's hard to fake. That's the old Alice! Sadly, this album is the last of the classic Alice Cooper magic. Sure, I witnessed his comeback(s). "Trash" had a moment or two, but not the CLASSIC Cooper sound. Not everything on Zipper works, but most of it rocks.
0	Let's forget this one happened While it's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name, the WHO'S THAT GIRL? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair. Due to Madonna's incredible popularity, this disc managed to hit the Hot 200's Top Ten and reach Platinum status in sales, but it's far from a must-own now. Madonna contributes four tracks, and they all sound like TRUE BLUE out-takes. Madonna wrote the big hit "Who's That Girl?" (#1 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary, #44 Dance) with Patrick Leonard, and it's a virtual rewrite of their own superior "La Isla Bonita." The wistful ballad "The Look of Love" (also co-written with Leonard) is less derivative, but much more ordinary. The frantic, Steve Bray-produced dance track "Causing A Commotion" (#2 Pop, #1 Dance) fares much better, and is an undervalued gem in Madonna's singles catalogue. The only other Madonna cut (the generic "Can't Stop," also produced and co-written by Bray) is an obvious throwaway, yet it is still better than any of the other non-Madonna tracks. The remaining cuts are by other "artists" (I use that term loosely) and are anonymous and unlistenable. There's a reason why Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi never went anywhere.
1	Quincy, I Never Had it So Damn Good! Just listen to the piece, ''Love, I Never Had It So Good'' and tell me that this doesn't move you. This is the most creative piece of work I have ever listened to. I had an employee of a vinyl record store play this album and even he was moved by that song. Luther Vandross sounds so young on ''Sounds...." he really does sounds a bit different than on his later recordings. Vandross comes across as fresh and more soulful back then than he ever did in his 80's recordings. ''Love Me By Name" is just wonderful and I dig the black choir that comes in to accompany Patti Austin. I have heard other Jones' production but this one takes the cake. It is the best one I have heard. ''Tell Me a Bedtime Story''moves the hell out of me. I am not jiving yall. Please buy this record!! You can't go wrong with Chaka Khan, Ashford and Simpson, Luther Vandross, Herbie Hancock, Patti Austin, and Gwen Gutherie coming together to make a really prolific album.
0	Are you kidding! I can't beleive the amount of good reviews of this CD. I have most of the Pat Metheny library and this CD is the worst by far. It was like listening to all of his un-inspired, not-as-good, filler songs in one sitting. Yuck! Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Metheny's work, but this CD was just BAD
0	Atrocious Noise Reduction Job I'm appalled this CD is still in print using the same horrid transfers Sony made in 1991. The major label philosophy at that time was, "Eliminate any and all trace of hiss or crackle from the original 78, no matter if it totally kills the music in the process." Great progress has been made since that time in the development of technology to transfer 78s without destroying the music, but has Sony bothered to create a new remaster? No. They are still pressing new CDs from the original 1991 transfers and they sound HORRID. Save your money, I beg of you, and wait for somebody to do this material correctly. This release is a disgrace.
1	beyond praise and time Edith Piaf died in 1963. Her chansons (= French for 'songs') live on. Even stronger than that: the more time passes by, the more one realizes how breathtakingly good they are. Though definitely set in the mid-20th century, Piaf's voice, style, timbre (= French for 'rhytm') and choice of repertoire effortlessly deal with any passage of time. Setting doesn't matter at all, and the same goes for the limited recording technics of her days. Being widely recognized as the 'soul of France', Piaf carries her chansons to the most extreme corners of planet earth. Right up to this day. In Europe her 'Non, je ne regrette rien' (= No, I don't regret anything) makes the greatest impact: the 'life goes on'-undertone of this chanson still brings inspiration & courage to millions of her admirers. 'Non, je ne regrette rien' also reflects Piaf's own life: being of very modest origin, she surely had to put up a stiff fight to gain her immortality. She did so by finding her inspiration in a deep & uncompromising love for her native France. As only a limited part of humanity speaks French, Piaf's achievement is all the more impressive. One should realize Americans & English always have an easy ride: 50% of the world's population speaks their language, while the other half adapts to it for reasons of efficiency. No, surely any number of stars isn't enough to reflect on Edith Piaf's chansons. Their quality takes this mid-20th century chansonniere beyond praise and time.
1	Awesome Worship CD!! I truly enjoyed listening to the CD, especially the arrangement of Wrapped Up, Tied Up, Tangled Up and Just For Who You Are. Earnest is leading us into worship and pouring out his heart. May God continue to bless and keep him. MD / Concord Churc
1	Music for the Mozart Effect This CD is a compilation of various tunes geared to stimulate the mind. I really enjoy listening to it
1	addictive listenable dance music I personally don't like repetitive boom*tch-boom*tch-boom*tch type of music that goes on for 10 minutes, erlende oye does a great job of selecting songs that are catchy but doesn't get played out easily. Maybe I'm biased too, i like kings of convenience and royksopp, but this album is very upbeat, funky, yet diverse (Phoenix, Avenue D). There's no categorizing it, electro, house, pop, it's just good catchy beats
0	Weak selections bring the album down Usually the &quot;Grammy Nominees&quot; series produces a compilation in which, understandably, some pieces are way below the others in quality. The 2001 edition suffers more than ever of this syndrome. In fact, quality is truly hard to find on this CD. Under the label of &quot;pop&quot; several unworthy songs somehow find their way into the selections. Hard to understand why, but the few decent tracks merely manage to assert that some effort was actually put into the decision. The variety of genres that appear merely confuse me about what exactly is the purpose of this CD, rather than provide a large field from which to find something that I like. The fact is, it is so broad that a fan of a particular style of music will be left utterly disappointed. 1)&quot;Say my name&quot; - a normally catchy song that seems out of place on this album. 2)&quot;I try&quot; - decent effort by Macy Gray, but she does not deserve to win a Grammy. 3)&quot;Music&quot; - Madonna's new song is nothing above average. 4)&quot;Bye bye bye&quot; - Usually annoying 'Nsync produce a better to digest single, but no reason to incorporate on this CD. 5)&quot;Beautiful day&quot; - U2's magnificent song, one of the best of the year, is one of the high points on the album. 6)&quot;Sexx laws&quot; - mildly agreeable Beck single similar to most of his work. 7)&quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; - overplayed Eminem single is great, but no reason to buy this CD; buy his album instead. 8)&quot;Optimistic&quot; - extremely disappointing song from Radiohead; a definite weak point. 9)&quot;You're the one&quot; - Paul Simon's new track is enjoyable at most, but marks musical talent at its best. 10)&quot;Cousin Dupree&quot; - moderately bouncy music by Steely Dan does not justify their win. 11)&quot;What a girl wants&quot; - it is simply shameful to include such kind of bubble gum pop on a respectable compilation 12)&quot;Save me&quot; - very docile and slightly unnerving song from a new artist; decidedly bad choice. 13)&quot;Both sides now&quot; - another uninspired pick; nondescript in every way. 14)&quot;Oops!I did it again!&quot; - Britney is OK, but if she deserved a place at the Grammys, it would have to be for her prevoius album. 15)&quot; Show me the meaning...&quot; - almost disturbing Backstreet Boys have no place in the same room with a Grammy; a ghastly song, truly repulsive. 16)&quot;Pinch me&quot; - the best and the brightest on this album; Barenaked Ladies truly underrated as a band, always producing high quality music. 17)&quot;Breathless&quot; - The Corrs are nothing spectacular, but still bearable. To make a long story short, this album is only for collectors
0	Mozart For Masochists I love Glenn Gould -- when he's playing Bach, that is. But Gould hated Mozart, and while some of his early Mozart recordings are quite nice, the Mozart recordings he did in the 60's and 70's (i.e., on these discs) were simply bizarre. And not in a good way. They are exhibitions in spite, and spite is not fun to listen to. Granted, some of the slow movements are played beautifully -- but there's more to Mozart than slow movements. The fast movements (i.e., two thirds of the music in the average sonata) are a horror. If you want to hear Gould at his eccentric best, buy anything he did with Bach -- or his Haydn albums, his early Beethoven sonatas (avoid Sonata No. 23, though), his Sibelius, Scriabin, Schoenberg or his Byrd & Gibbons albums. But stay clear of Mozart.
0	Superb lyrics and music - lifeless sound No doubt, these lyrics and music are superb; after all, this is why I purchased this CD. What wonderful memories! But, this particular CD's sound quality is lifeless and dimensionless. I didn't intend for this CD to be simply background music, as I like to become "drawn into" the recording, but that's all I can do. What a disappointment! I have ordered many wonderful CD's from Amazon that sound great, but felt compelled to write and warn others. I give this CD at 5-star rating for its lyrics and music, but only a 1-star for it's sound quality. With engineering like this, its no wonder so many would rather use free music-sharing services on the Internet rather than make a purchase
0	Old Recordings Rehashed Into A New CD. Very disappointing, It's just old recordings rehashed onto a new CD and I heard that LeAnn who is a wonderful singer didn't even have any say about this CD being released! Also there aren't enough patriotic songs! I really hope that LeAnn makes a new CD of all newly recorded Patriotic songs and another one that is all Inspirational Gospel songs
1	Chaotic Metal: Definitely An Acquired Taste I got a good laugh out of the sticker on the corner of "Everything Is Alive..." that read something like "For Fans of Opeth, Unearth, and ASHLEE SIMPSON". A band on Solid State Records that sounds like a mediocre pop "star"? Yeah right; this band definitely has sense of humor. When I first played the CD, I listened to the first track all the way through. I absolutely hated it. I then skipped through all the other tracks and listened to about 30 seconds of each. More of the same. I couldn't believe that I had wasted my money on this pile of slow-paced loud noisy garbage. The guitar feedback grated on my eardrums, and I ended up with a massive headache. Needless to say, I took a break from The Chariot for a while. A few weeks later, however, the song "Die Interviwer" popped up on my mp3 player's random shuffle, so I listened to the whole song. I could actually tolerate it. Soon, I started listening to more and more songs from the album, and I was amazed by the realness of the sound, and the incredible brutality of it all: the ripping guitars, the pounding drums, and the lead singer, who roars like a man possessed. I listened to the album all the way through, and I was hooked. The Chariot is a truly incredible band, and is nothing like I've ever heard before. They draw a listener in more than Norma Jean ever will. They are just as amazingly brutal in concert, also. However, a word of warning: You cannot just start listening to this band. A love of metal is required, and you have to be open to new styles. I would recommend listening to bands such as Becoming the Archetype before picking this album up. But it is well worth it; listening to The Chariot is a breathtaking experience
0	Nothing Compared to the original Sorry but this album is nothing compared to the original by andrew. The depth of voice of the lead singer is lacking and the orcherster is half a sleep I was very disapointed by this album. I STRONGLY reccomend the orignal instead
0	An unfortunate production The "Hardest Thing" I've ever had to do Is listen to this cd, February 28, 2005 Recently I had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man. I was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory, where I put paper clips into cardboard boxes, when I passed a man asking for spare change. I apologized because I had none to give him, and he handed me this cd. "Take this," he said in his grizzled wino voice. "I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it." So I brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while I was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress, Angela Adams. I wish I had not put it in the cd player, because the music that came out was really not that good. Imagine if the Backstreet Boys met O-Town for dinner, and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat. N'Sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed, but Nick Lachey steps forward and says, "No, N'Sync! Go away! We don't want any danceable beats or r&b flava in our music!" So Justin Timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks. Not only is the 98 Degrees music boring, but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues. 1. The font which is used to write the words "And Rising" is an unfortunate choice. The components of the "d" in "and" are not joined as tightly as they might be, so the "d" looks like an "al." This changes the name of the album significantly. 2. The boys are standing in front of a wall of fire, which I assume is supposed to be a reference to their name, 98 Degrees, which is a warm temperature. However, any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than 98 Degrees. Human beings are hotter than 98 Degrees, usually by about .6 degrees, and they BURN when put into fire. In fact, 98 Degrees the temperature is not that hot, just like 98 Degrees the performing group. 3. Several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band's name on their arms. How lame is that? Can you imagine if people in all bands did that? I bet Emma Bunton would feel really lame right now, what with the Spice Girls having broken up and become completely irrelevant to pop culture. What's that? 98 Degrees is no more? No one buys their music? Nick Lachey is best known as Mr. Jessica Simpson? Ha ha! Bet you're glad you got that tattoo now, sucker! I recommend you not buy this cd. Buy anything else instead. I hear Britney Spears is genius
1	Full Metal Jacket Full metal jacket is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. Although the language is too strong for many people (not for me), it definately puts the point across about the harsh life of Marines during training on the Island. The sniper scene is very well done as well. Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is portrayed by an excellent actor who is able to scream obscenities at his troops without even cracking a smile, I would like to see the bloopers reel from Full Metal Jacket
0	It hurt my ears I have just listened to the samples available online, and being a native spanish speaker, the gramatical errors I have heard hurt my ears. I am also bringing up my baby bilingual english/spanish, and as someone mentioned in a previous review, mixing the two lenguages goes against the expert's advice, as it creates confusion for the baby
0	ocean's 12 soundtrack expected something much better- the actual music from the movie instead of instrumental
0	A G-Unit Breakdown If you're looking for good Aftermath-produced or G-Unit affiliated music, here's which artists to go to and which to stay far, far away from: 50 Cent-- Go nowhere near The Massacre. You're 5% more likely to suffer a slow, painful death just by touching the case. It is the worst CD you could possibly ever hear. Same thing goes with the movie soundtrack. Get Rich or Die Tryin (the original) on the other hand, is solid... especially on those bonus tracks (Heaven, Life on the Line, U Not Like Me), Patiently Waiting, 21 Questions, and anything featuring another G-Unit member. PIMP, with its lack of Snoop Dogg (which the music video seemed to promise), High All the Time, Many Men, and Wanksta can kind of get old though. The thing about 50 Cent these days is that by himself he is no longer any good at all. He needs to be held up by a crutch of some better rapper before he can make good with his own rap. The reason he succeeds so well in his collaborations with The Game in The Documentary and Eminem in The Re-Up is because he has actually GOOD rappers holding him up. He's like the Abbott of the comedians Abbott & Costello now. He has nothing worth contributing without his Costello of some kind to be there for him. The Game-- As soon as I heard this guy's album and compared it to 50's Massacre, I knew that if G-Unit was going anywhere, this guy would be the one to take it there. And now it turns out he left. Can't blame him when the clique-label's leader is so dumb. Was the most progressive rapper of the crew, and his reason for leaving is probably because of how anti-progressive 50's Massacre was. Has the best, deepest subject matter within his songs, if not the best flow (Although his underground 300 Bars song would automatically crown him king if he did that well all the time on his main albums). As far as the mainstream and not underground CDs go though, I'd give him a 2nd best for flow of the G-Unit crew. His Documentary album has been called the third Chronic, and has the best of Dre's beats you'll find on any G-Unit CD. Criticisms are that he name-drops Dre & NWA a bit too much, but overall, I think it's not that big of a deal. He's a big hip-hop history fan, and he's still a little starstruck over the chance of being able to work with Dre. Given a very brief profile of the rapper, he fits into an uncomfartable stereotype, (average-looking rapper from Compton who's been shot a few times), but he immediately carves a personality of his own in the Doctor's Advocate and his even better The Documentary. Young Buck-- I'd say probably the best G-Unit member still in G-Unit. This guy has the best flow, as far as mainstream CDs are concerned. He also seems to be the 2nd-most concerned about the world (a.k.a. 'progressive'), with references to the Illuminati amongst other secret organizations. I like this guy the best of the remaining G-Unit. 2nd best comes sort of close to him, but still doesn't match Buck's raw skills. Lloyd Banks-- This guy is second best. His flow skills somewhat tie for 2nd place with The Game's, or at least land in that area. He, Buck, and The Game are my top three for G-Unit (even though The Game's not G-Unit anymore). Anybody else you can probably pass up. I'll go over them real quick just to make sure you know who the others are beforehand. Tony Yayo-- The one male member who is worse than 50 Cent. In the G-Unit CD, they always shouted 'Free Yayo!' and now he is free. The G-Unit had done a terrible thing by campaigning for his release. His is of no benefit whatsoever to them. He might even be responsible for the gradual dumbening of 50's style & outlook on life. Joe-- The kind of R&B star you'd expect to sing chorus or backup on an Outkast track, mixed with a bit of R. Kelley and a very small splash of Stevie W. He's not bad I guess. I hated him completely on 'Wanna Get to Know You' of the G-Unit CD, but would definitely still listen to his 'Ride Wit U' track off his own solo album. Olivia-- Pssh, are you dumb? No. She's partially responsible for Candy Shop. That should be reason enough to hate her full-on and never turn back. She kind of can't sing either. Bad move to make an R&B CD without being able to sing, I think. Lil' Scrappy-- This is the same Lil' Scrappy you heard on Lil' Jon's "What U Gon Do?" track. He's pretty good. Decent at least. Definitely not as decent as 50 Cent's original Get Rich or Die Tryin, but decent. He's got a good enough style though that places him above everyone else still in G-Unit, excluding Lloyd Banks and Young Buck, but including 50 Cent by himself. I think that's everybody. So... now you know all about G-Unit, and who's good and who's not. If you HAVE to buy G-Unit, now you know who to avoid and who to embrace. If you plan on buying the original Get Rich or Die Tryin, I suggest you don't. Burn it, or have a friend burn it for you. 50 doesn't need the money right now or ever again. If you decide not to buy G-Unit, then more power to you. The Game is actually now sort of the anti-G-Unit since he left, because, you know, the majority of their members still suck. I'd suggest Mos Def's Black on Both Sides instead of any of this stuff though... even if you were planning on buying G-Unit. That's probably the best hip-hop album I've ever heard, or will hear
1	love it! that's all i have to say. plain and simple. dr. thompson's cds have a made a postive impact on my life so much so that i have gone out and purchased more and more. the delta 2 cd has helped me attain sleep quicker and more restful than ever. i prefer the 2nd theta cd for meditation but will listen to the first for more creative mediation and thinking. i am now a devoted fan. and can not say enough about the effectiveness of the good doctor's work
0	Derek Trucks-Songlines This CD was very disappointing. The guitar rifs were sloppy and there were maybe two songs that were worthy of the purchase
1	Electric Cafe Electric Cafe was a very much delayed project and was originally called Technopop and should have included the awesome single Tour de France. After years of frustration and innuendo the album was finally released in 1986. It is way of ahead of its time in its use of sampling, loops and the way they use their keyboards. it has 6 awesome tracks on it starting with boing boom tshak and ending with the hypnotic electric cafe, Sex Object is the best track on the entire cd with amazing beats, lyrics and a melody that is quite accomplished. The book-let is typical Kraftwerk with very little information and odd looking photographs. The graphics may look basic today (2005), but back in 1986 this was cutting edge and if one used computers back then, then one knows how advanced these graphics truly were for their time. This is a great album from Kraftwerk. It is just a shame that they record so seldom these days
1	K-ci & JoJo Greatest Fan First of all, a lot of people are wondering where have these guys been? They were recently in a play entitled Guilty until proven innocent. This album was great-good for when your making love. But it should have included at least four new songs on it. And they are suppose to be coming out with a greatest hit DVD. I don't think its out yet, have anyone purchased it
1	The Most Overrated Classical Recording of All Time. It's Still Good Though... This ultra famous recording of the the Beethoven Fifth and Seventh is absurdly overpraised. I'm not going to be a Mr. Know-It-All and attack these performances just because people love them, I'm just going to try to be fair and impartial and get at the core of why these recordings shouldn't be deemed so unsurpassable. Kleiber is an exceptional conductor and he knows exactly what he is doing, his penchant for drama, attack and drive, work well with these two symphonies but they miss quite a bit too. The VPO for instance is a great orchestra but they don't always rise to the challenge here. I want to pay particular attention to the sound of these recordings which is simply not that great. It's servicable, actually typical Deutsche Grammophon sound from the mid-70s. It's cold, at times harsh and stringy. The opening of the last movement of the 5th symphony is shrill, there is no resplendent majesty here like you get in Karajan's 1962 version or Guilini's version from the early 80's with the LAPO. Kleiber's first movement is fast, intense but lacks the ultimate power I heard in the Karajan and Giulini versions. The second movement is good, Kleiber doesn't rush things, the scherzo is terrific, the transition to the finale doesn't have much mystery, certainly not the heaven storming insanity that Furtwangler brings to it in his war-time recording from the 1940's. Kleiber is also very literal in his observation of repeats in these works. Repeats everywhere you can find them is typically the norm in recent times. The repeat in the first movement is a must, obviously every conductor takes it but the finale repeat is a matter of choice. Kleiber of course takes it and it's to his credit that the movement doesn't drag as it might under someone else. Giulini's last movement does drag because he takes a slower tempo along with the repeat. Karajan on the other hand, never took the finale repeat in any of his versions, from 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s! All the Karajan versions fly to the finish with unbelievable, exhilarating force! So with Giulini or Kleiber, you're more exhausted by the end of the symphony, with Karajan, you're on cloud nine, ecstatic because of the power of the Berlin Philharmonic and because he skips the redundant repeat. Of course Kleiber's version is terrific but I would not give it this high of a status among classical recordings. Here are the best Beethoven 5ths, any Karajan version, especially the '62 and '77, the later 80's digital version is extremely powerful too but not as well played as the earlier versions. They all do pack quite a punch. Giulini with the LAPO is among the best, then Carlos Kleiber is up there in that great company as well, but not the definitive at all. If you want a Furtwangler 5th, of course there is the war-time performance to go to. It has a slow first movement but the rest of the work is majestic beyond words. Unfortunately you have to deal with the mono sound, even though it's not that bad. The 7th symphony is a tricky one and I've never been completely convinced by any version that I've heard. Kleiber once again takes all the damn repeats! It's ok in the first movement, but he takes one too many in the scherzo and he takes the repeat in the final movement which makes things way too repetitive, many conductors used to skip this repeat but Kleiber is so bloody literal minded! Karajan's versions of the 7th are just too driven for my taste, even though Karajan's finales have always been the best! The fast speed works well in the finale. Kleiber is less driven than Karajan and Carlos is also more humane in the Allegreto. However, all these versions just don't spark me too much. Furtwangler on the other hand is outstanding but of course you have to deal with the old mono sound. You can find his version on the Music and Arts label. In addition, check out the very weighty, traditional approach of Christian Thielemann with the Philharmonia Orchestra on a recent Beethoven record, with great sound that easily surpasses the sound of the Kleiber and Karajan recordings. What you ultimately have here in Kleiber, is pretty intense, terrific performances but with some catches involved. The sound is not great, the Vienna Philharmonic lacks the unbelievable virtuosity of the Berlin Philharmonic and Kleiber insists on all the repeats just like most recent conductors and that tends to make things drag in the 7th symphony. All reservations aside, they are still great performances but this is surely not the holy grail of classical recordings!
1	Roxy Music is the drug. This collection is older, but it's 20 tracks long, and does include most of the essential Roxy/Ferry songs. Included amongst all these killer songs is "Love Is The Drug", "More Than This", "Avalon", and "Slave To Love". It would truly be impossible to fit everything on one disc, but the only things I really miss is Roxy's "Mother Of Pearl", and Ferry's "Kiss And Tell" and "Limbo". Otherwise it actually does a great job as a "best of". This being currently out of print however, you may have to hit the used stores, or deal with another "hits" album.
1	One of, if not the best electronic music album ever made My title for this review may sound a bit over the top, but rest assured, it is not an exaggeration. This music was composed using a synth that the Berrons built themselves (this was before you could buy a synth) and composed this music for the sci-fi film. Whether you like the movie or not, this music stands on it's own. Brilliant compositions and beautiful, innovative electronics that interestingly enough, despite all the resources and technology available now, easily surpass most electronic work being done today. For fans of good, serious electronic music (and by good I DON'T mean techno or some crap like that), this is essential music. Do not miss out on this masterpiece
0	the worst of GM This is a very simple review. Call it a warning. This album by GM is cheesy, period. The squeaky vocals and the weak synth lines are far inferior to GM's other album, "From Here to Eternity." On that cd, the tracks are very trancy, features electro vocals and nice chord changes. The beat is stronger and harder. Especially good, besides the title track, is track #6: "First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love." Excellent techno riff that lacks the cheesey vocals, dated Expose sound effects and stabs. It just rolls and rolls and rolls. Nice driving cd. However, E=MC2 is a cd to pass on. I was very disappointed. One more note, this album sounds old and dated. "Eternity" could still work a dancefloor now. No one would think it's almost 30 years old
1	best in a long time this is one of the best CDs I have purchased in a long time. Very raw and emotional. A great, great find
0	Birtney Spears has not yet broken out of her shell Sure,this cover can say she looks good and trying to look hot.She's trying so hard to give off an image that's not her.She's being and mostly acts like a tramp.Have you seen her videos? Brintey can not break out of her shell and between the rebelious and outrageous lyrics,I see a sad girl being consumed by the media.Sure,she laughs and she looks as if she is having a good time on her videos but come on!Briney hides behind her clothes and lyrics and her record deal.It's all tenn pop lyrics penned down on her notepad while she's waiting in line! I am dissapointed and I hope she writes better songs but from the heart,go Britney!Britney rock on please!
0	Face The Facts People Kool Keith=Nasty Ass, weird Lyrics with a horrible flow, and on this CD they suck even more to craptastic beats... Have Fun
0	George's Sleeping Pill George Harrison had incredible talents that inspired the world. He was not only a member of the Beatles but he was also one of the writers. In his solo career he sang along side of Bob Dylan and other greats in the "Concert for Bangladesh". . . . So just what happened? How did this man who soared with the eagles suddenly take a nose dive and swim in the turkey droppings? How could such a winner like George Harrison create such a loser of a solo album? My guess, maybe, it was his divorce with Patti Boyd at the time. Perhaps it may have been because of his laryngitis, but that had already healed after he made his "Dark Horse" album. But whatever the reason, his other albums take off to the skies while this one crashes into a tree. Harrison plagiarizes his own material with "This Guitar Can't Keep From Crying" which is pitiful excuse for "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". If you have a small child that cannot go to sleep, just play him this song at night and the problem will be solved. The best song this album is "You" which is horribly mediocre but the only one that is not boring. The song "His Name is Legs" could have been a good hard rock song except that it was too repetitious and you would still get bored after the first half. The rest of the album is a giant sleeping pill. No need for over the counter insomnia medicine! Play this record before you go to bed and have a great night's sleep!
1	Beautiful Music Two long time friends together, reminiscing and playing absolutely beautiful blues and ballads. If &quot;New Orleans Blues&quot; or &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; don't bring a tear to your eye, then you need to check with a doctor to see if you are still alive. Why the Amazon sales rank on this CD is so low is beyond my comprehension. Wonderful recording quality. These recordings along with the other in this series are among Lonnie Johnson and Elmer Snowden's finest --amazing since both are considered to have peaked performance wise in the late 20s/early 30s
1	the best This is the Allman Brothers BEST, I don't need to go on. Just own it
0	Supposed Former Alanis Fan Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is one of the most eccentric albums to have been released in the 90's. Nobody can dismiss it as a complete failure because it genuinely does have its moments. But then of course there are songs like "Front Row" or "One" (to name just a few) that are shamelessly self-indulgent and should never have been released to the commercial public. The problem with Alanis, is that she has never been able to leave some things to a listener's imagination. What helped "Jagged Little Pill" become one of the ten best-selling albums of all time in the United States is that the lyrics were personal, but generic enough to still spark the fascination of listeners. In the case of "Supposed Former," the lyrics are painstakingly overwritten well beyond the point of gratuitousness and rather than follow a coherent format, they meander. This sort of no-holds-barred lyrical approach suits certain songs--"Baba," "Thank U," "The Couch," and "So Pure" at least adhere their obscure lyrics to a structured melody. If all art is valid, then everyone should have a painting hanging up in the Louvre, but the sign of a true artist is one who can temper their artistic integrity in a manner that engages others. "Jagged Little Pill" was a catchy, poignant, emotive masterpiece that struck a nerve with tens of millions of people. "Supposed Former," on the other hand, is far too self-involved and should have remained in the pages of Alanis' diary; where such clumsy, wordy, overreaching attempts at poetry belong. Unfortunately, this killed whatever momentum "Jagged Little Pill" had created and permanently closed the door on Alanis for tens of millions of fans
1	Brava Sarah! This is undoubtedly my favorite CD of the last decade and definitely Sarah Brightman's best effort to date! Her duets with Andrea Bocelli and Jose Cura are outstanding! I especially love 'O mio babbino caro', Alleluja', and 'La Wally'. Sarah's uniquely sensual style is evident in the incredibly beautiful 'Bilitis - Generique', 'No One Like You' and 'Just Show Me How To Love You'. Close your eyes and drift away... It is highly unusual for me to like every song on a CD, but on 'Time to Say Goodbye', I do. It has a unique way of making me feel completely relaxed while encouraging me to sing along at the same time. It's long past time for a sequel to this wonderful album
0	Edited Rhino's specialty 2 stars only because Rhino used single version and not the original long version. Why do they do this? When I read a book I read all of it not just part of it, the same is true with a song.
0	F*ck the Frog I love jazz, really. But candidly speaking, Bud Powell's frog croaking vocalizations ruin just about every damn piece of music he's ever been involved with! I just want to strangle him whenever he starts that crap in one of his tunes. Why did he feel the need to do that? Didn't he realize he was destroying his music as he recorded it? I'm sorry to offend folks, but an idiot Powell was, a complete idiot. He blew it
1	DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE, MAN!!!!! look here, i knew that there was more to this band than EXPRESS YOURSELF. this cd more than satisfied that. everything on here bumps. i can do without the slow stuff, but overall, mr. wright and company DID THEY THANG!!!!! UHHHHH!!!! i love charles' voice; especially on YOUR LOVE (MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME). that stands out because it sounds like his voice was all shot and he still found something in it to deliver. if you like true blue funkiness, then get this. it is cats and bands like this that never get played on the radio, which sucks, that really bring that sausage gravy vibe. you will understand that latter once you cop this or download it
0	Regarding full-length "Dazz" by Brick I bought "Old School - Vol. 2" specifically to get the full-length version of Dazz by Brick, among other songs. I was disappointed and angry that it was the 5 min. radio version. After reading your reviews here, I'm glad I didn't choose to get the Best of Brick. Though I enjoy other songs by Brick, Dazz is my all-time favorite. Today I found the long version on the "Disco Super Hits" CD. Though I'm not crazy about other songs on this CD it's worth the money. I will be playing my Dazz over and over with my sun-roof open, a smile on my face, and the wind blowing free in my hair! :-
0	No long version of Dazz here Have you ever heard a song that finds its way into your head, going round and round and round - but you can't place the title of it, or the group ? So it was with me, and "Dazz", put out by a group called "Brick" in the 70s. Imagine my delight when I heard a similar track on my XM car radio, which displays the title and group of every song played. A little research, and, voila, I had found the origin of that song which was playing in my memory.....but, alas, the song in my memory was approximately 15 minutes long, with absolutely tremendous flute and bass solo's. I ordered the "Best of Brick".....imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be the 3-minute version of the song. Subsequent research on the web, and Amazon, indicates that there is currently NO cd with the long track of Dazz. A real shame. If you're looking for the long version of Dazz, don't waste your money on this CD.
0	Lame and embarassing Well I am a bit jaded because I live in a city where everybody talks and looks like Larry The Cable guy. If the people here don't resemble him then they resemble Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. So I get to put up with both extremes in real life. Why would anybody want to pay for this load of nonsense unless you are from a real sophisticated state or city and this to you is hilarious because you are laughing at how lame this obese comedian is. The blue collar TV show was mildly funny. This CD on the other hand is not funny. It isn't even crude or offensive. This humor is childish and bad and possibly young kids would think it was funny for a week but most adults wouldn't buy into this stuff for a minute.
0	Completely disappointed After hearing Ice Box I was very excited to hear the rest of the album. This album was supposed to be somewhat dark and haunting. Exactly what Ice Box contains. A dark and haunting melody. The rest of the album is completely trash. So if you read this. You're best buying the single for Ice Box
0	What a Disappointment Overall, this is nothing more than a bunch of entrance themes for the WWF; if you don't believe me, just ask Edge. In my opinion, there is not one good song on this entire CD, and I have been a huge fan of Rob and White Zombie in the past. Rob, please go back to making good music and refrain from making garbage like this
0	Reality Check I have a fairly extensive collection of comedy albums, and I gatta say this is probably one of the lamest I've ever heard. If you enjoy hearing a one-line joke dragged out to 5-6 minutes (like the worst episodes of SNL), then maybe this is tolerable. maybe ONCE. The people giving this high ratings are either Norm's friends or people too young to have experienced true wit. Trust me, if you listen to this once you will probably never play it agai
0	Disgusting! Thought this CD would be funny after seeing it promoted on John Daily's Show. We tried everywhere to find it and finally found it on Amazon. What a letdown we had after finally receiving it and listening to it. This was a total waste of our money. It wasn't funny at all - would probably call it sick or stupid. Thought this guy was a comedian - he must be on his downhill slide. He isn't funny at all! Please don't waste your money on this one.
0	did't play I tried it in a cd player dvd player computer came up blank now i've givin up this is the first time this has happen
1	out of this world this album would have the 5 stars it deserves if it weren't for Mr. Feng nit-picking about technical stuff. if you don't want all the extra versions of tunji you can go out to any music store and get the original version for $12. "out of this world" is the most profoundly beautiful musical statement I have ever heard, from any artist, in any genre. that track alone makes it worth the price of admission.
0	not so good I think that this album of Natalie is not so good; there are many songs that in their original versions (Criminal by Fiona Apple, If I ever lose my faith in you by Sting, Day dreaming by Aretha Frankin)were very good songs, while Natalie, in her interpretations, make them much more "pop" than they were before; "pop" in the sense that Natalie's interpretations are more commercial and easy. I don't like this album very much; the only song that I consider good is You gotta be
1	Controversial and Classic!!!!! Wow! After reading the reviews on Amazon for this cd, I can tell that above anything else, Natalie Cole stirs a lot of emotion in her audience. It's a rare quality that inspires others to speak out the way everyone has on this controversial cd! From that hot wailing vocal in the opening song "Criminal" to the searing gospel version of "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You", this collection is a WINNER!!! Natalie has tackled various genres and made them her definitive version of each song. She is funky in "Old Man", soulful in "Day Dreaming", and haunting in "The Man With The Child In His Eyes". I can't help but feel that these song writers would not only give her a nod, but the Grammy award as well! You can count me in when Natalie comes to town in concert. I can't wait to see her perform these songs and more! Thank you Natalie! I can't say that you're "back", because you simply never went away
1	splendid I've never heard such delicate and beautiful playing of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier such as this. Schiff coaxes the most incredibly sweet sounds out of his piano and gives these works a new dimension. Some of the tempi in the fugues are slower than those of Gould's survey, as indicated by the reviewer below, but his phrasing is so flowing and smooth that it becomes more hypnotic and the listener becomes entranced by it. Add to the fact that the sound is remarkably full with just the right amount of resonance without compromising clarity (compared to Gould's discs which offer impressive crispness but is rather dry in tone) this set is satisfying in every way
0	I wish I could rate zero stars I bought this CD last Friday and knew I had made a mistake within 30 seconds of the 1st song. I only made it through the 4th track before removing it from my CD player and returning to the store to exchange it. I can respect complex time changes, but being good at math does not make for good music. I heard nothing that could be considered a melody and also nothing that sounded like actual instrumental talent. They may know how to play their instruments, but they do not know HOW to play. Also, the production is terrible. The praise of this album strikes me as some kind of joke. It's that bad. If you want to listen to instrumental rock/metal made by talented muscians who know how to play and write music that is not painfull to listen to, check out Gordian Knot "Emergent."
0	UB40 The Best of I ordered this CD specifically for Red, Red Wine and the whole song isn't even on there! I was VERY disappointed. Best song they ever recorded and I wasted my money trying to get it. Don't get this CD if you like that song
1	5 Star Music...But This Can't Be Rudy's Best Remastering Overall, this remaster is very good. But I have a 1983 Japanese LP issue of A NIGHT AT BIRDLAND that blows Rudy's away. Check out the alternate of "Wee Dot" on this CD--for the love of Clifford, Art Blakey's cymbal rips our ear drums, and ruins Clifford's solo, which is actually the better solo of the two takes. You know something? I question wrether this really is the great Rudy's remastering, especially when you consider this: when asked, in a 1986 interview on NPR, what his regrets are, without hesitation he replied, "Not having the technology back then to accurately reproduce Clifford Brown's trumpet sound" (wow, as great as Clifford sounds on record, we will never really hear him). Anyone with such love for Clifford could not have done such lousy remastering on the "Wee-Dot" alternate (I think producer Michael Cuscuna just puts Rudy's name on many of these). I do want to note, the absolutely essential "Once in a While," Clifford's greatest ballad next to "Ghost of a Chance," sounds much better than on previous domestic issues, and alone is worth many times the price of these volumes. I think these RVG issues are little more than another of Michael Cuscuna's re-marketing strategies. Geeze, how many times does he expect us to buy these same titles? But we do! We get suckered in, thinking these will be the best-sounding yet--just because they were remastered by Rudy Van Gelder himself. How many issues, how many years, does it take to get it right? For the Japanese, it takes just once. They had it right as far back as 1985, when they issued the Prestige Jazz Masterpieces series--gorgeous sound! (Compare those 1985 CDs, if you're lucky enough to own any, to the currently available harsh and brittle sounding domestic OJC CDs of the same sessions.) Japanese Blue Notes always sound magnificent--perfect. Very simply put, they are the best documentation of the masters on earth. I know the jazz CD market is nothing like the trillion dollar pop CD market; Blue Note and Mosaic are probably barely keeping above water. Thus repackaging the same music every few years is probably necessary to keep the Blue Note catalog in existence (remember the days, just before CDs, when Blue Note LPs were simply no longer available...except from Japan?). And from reading Cuscuna's liner notes, I do believe he has a passion for this music. But remastering the domestic Blue Notes to, by design, make them sound inferior to, or at least very different from, the pristine Japanese Blue Notes is taking marketing strategy too far. I have this strong suspicion that Rudy did not actually remaster all of these in the RVG series. If you ask me, many of these RVGs are nothing more than previously shelved, unscheduled reissues and/or repackaged Connoisseur series issues--compare sometime to Connoisseus you may already own and you'll hear what I mean. All in all, there is some sort of racket going on between Cuscuna and the Japanese. Think about it: Why, after all these years, after all those issues--Blue Note, Connoisseur, Ultimate, Gold, 16-Bit, RVG--why do the Japanese CDs still sound superior? (By the way, they're not always priced at $35--you now can find Japanese Blue Notes as low as $14.29.) And, while I'm at it, how many times have you purchased "The Complete," only to discover a new issue with additional material? The answer to both those questions is simple: Michael Cuscuna knows what he's doing. I've not yet heard a Japanese RVG, but I'd bet if you compared one to a domestic RVG of the SAME title, you'd like the Japanese audio better. If I'm right, that would prove, this RVG marketing ploy is a crock. What, Rudy would master it differently for the Japanese? IMPORTANT NOTE: if you buy any of these RVGs, be sure to grab the two volumes of Thelonious Monk. These include the 1951, pre-RVG Blue Notes recorded by Doug Hawkins at WOR studios on lacquer discs, not tape. In remastering these sessions, Rudy applied a process by which the disc surface noise is now just about eliminated, and he brought out much detail and nuance--these Monk RVGs are really so incredible that previous issues are now simply obsolete. By the way, as the notes indicate, the sessions are complete, and "Four in One" and its alternate take are included even though the tray card track sequence is all out of whack and does not show the alternate of "Four in One." GET THESE--can't emphasize it enough. On the other hand, on PERFECT TAKES, the sample cut from Hank Mobley's SOUL STATION is in mono--why ever would Rudy remaster his originally stereo recording in mono!?
0	HOw about a band has to actually be good to havea hits cd? How can you even have a hits cd considering they had no decent music or hits to begin with? I listened to the entire cd and couldnt find a single song worth listening to for more than 8 seconds. This CD is full of horrible songs and now i have to have surgery to stop my ears from bleeding
1	Under da Sea We actually own the CD that was originally released when the movie was first released. It is one of our favorites. I'm not sure what several others are talking about when they say this one has the origninal score. The CD's have the same exact music, with the exception of the 2nd CD. As for the songs on the 2nd CD, we have heard several on Radio Disney. They are okay once you get passed the whole remake issue. I actually enjoy the Jonas Brothers version of Poor Unfortunate Souls.
1	First DGG album--very promising Anna Netrebko has rapidly become a first tier star in opera. This album, her first at DGG, illustrates why some rate her so highly; it also illustrates some of the questions that some have raised about her. All in all, though, a very nice CD. A few selections illustrate: Mozart, Idomeneo, "Quando avran fine omai." She displays a rich and clean voice. There is a very attractive quality to her voice manifest in this work. Mozart, Don Giovanni, "Crudele? Ah no, mio bene!...Non mi dir." This is Donna Anna's poignant aria, given her circumstances. Netrebko displays rich tones. This is a well sung cut. "Non mi dir" shows off some agility in her voice. Donizetti, Lucia di Lammermoor. "Ancor non giunse!. . .Regnava nel silenzio. . .Quando rapito in estasi" Something of a disappointment. Coloratura is not her forte (and see her "Sempre Libera" CD for further confirmation). She clearly shows off a rich and lush voice. I think that she displays some characterization here that is compelling. She hits high notes cleanly. But her ornamentation is indifferent, and she appears unable to trill. I know, some say that that is irrelevant. But compare Beverly Sills' version of this work, with almost too many trills extraordinarily well sung and her florid technique, and this version simply pales. Bellini, La Sonnambula. "Care compagna. . .Come per me sereno." Again, Netrebko displays a rich voice. She displays an agile voice and the ability to hit the high notes. Her rendition of "come per sereno" is spirited. Gounod, Faust. "The Jewel Song." Very smooth singing; animated singing. But the technique does not measure up to Anna Moffo's version--let alone Joan Sutherland's. Puccini, La Boheme. "Musetta's Waltz." Yikes! What a version. Brava Netrebko. Her darker voice is very well suited to this. The characterization of Musetta seems on the mark. A wonderful cut. All in all, this shows the promise of Netrebko. It also indicates where her strengths are and where she does not do so well (coloratura work). However, this is a very nice introduction to her work and her art.
0	Who is playing the Kazoo? These guys sound pretty good, but they need to lose the kazoo player
1	Like Jon Mayer? You'll LOVE JAK Wow. I have both of Jak's CDs. Each is awesome. Extremely well done - lyrics, music, tone...wow. I can't wait until a third album. I can't get enough. He's my new favorite singer-songwriter. You WILL NOT be disappointed with this purchase.
1	Typically Bacharach... ... loved this record all my life. I'm in my mid-30's now but fondly remember this from the early Seventies, when my Mum used to play it at my Grandparents house. It evokes some very warm memories... vaguely remember watching the film on TV too but it must have been a very long time ago. Bacharach's trademark orchestration runs throughout the album, the sudden burst of trumpet on the opening track followed by a crescendo as the strings come in made me fill up with tears... I hadn't heard this album since I was about ten and it seemed as fresh as yesterday! The instrumental break in 'Share the Joy' as the strings rise to a real high point never fail to make the hairs stand up on my arms, what a lovely lovely piece of music. The vocal performances too... flawed as they are, are perfect for the songs... they seem more natural and 'human' than some perfect operatic performance. Sally Kellerman's vocal is a great example of this. I'd always assumed that Peter Finch, Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey et al had actually performed the songs but now thanks to the superb sleeve notes I now know better... it shattered my illusions a little but hey... it still SOUNDS as if it's a stage actor trying his best to sing on 'It Might Frighten Her Away' and I LOVE IT!!! I was slightly worried that listening to this soundtrack again after SO long might be a let down... I needn't have worried... a superb bit of 'Bacharach & David' for old romantics everywhere. Here's to us all finding our own Shangri-La out there somewhere.
1	Brilliant Best moments here rival the best in pop history. Essential album from the 90's. Shimmering waves of silver light wash across a pitch-black canvas. Ethereal and haunting like the most beautiful of dreams. Like visiting heaven with your ears. Highest recommendation possible
1	A Spanish Lily The lovely shot of Gloria you're looking at is not misleading. The music inside is just as beautiful as the artist. Gloria has long used Spanish music to let her artistic soul flourish and this is her masterpiece. This album is filled with beauty. If you love music and you want to hear the best of what it has to offer from around the world, then this is a perfect place to start. Once the beautiful "With the Years That I Have Left" starts we are transported to an elegant and exotic club somewhere in South America. The sun has faded and a tropical moon has taken its place. The glossy hardwood counters are polished to perfection and the cherry finish complements a scattering of sego palms and Spanish lilies as wine glasses are filled with only the finest vintage. Gloria's rich and emotional vocals surround the room and are backed by a lush orchestra and breezy spanish guitars. So rich is the atmosphere we can almost feel her moving around the room and smiling as she passes by our small table. The songs move from love of one's homeland to romantic love lost or waiting, and everything in-between. Gloria fills this room with her magical phrasing of a beautiful language. We hear so many wonderful songs we dare not leave and miss a moment. There are songs of forgiveness and hope, and songs of true love and hanging on 'till the one lost to you returns. One song, the light and playful "Si Senor!" conjurs up images of the Andrew Sisters and another time. One of the prettier songs we hear before our time in this moonlit paradise is over is "Volveras" (You'll Be Back). Gloria knows the man leaving her for another and taking her heart with him will be back, because he can't erase her memory. But we know it's only a song. No one could be foolish enough to leave this Cuban flower. And all at once, it is over, and like all vacations, it has ended much too quickly. But what we've seen and heard has enriched and expanded our world. We want to come back once in awhile to feel like this again. Lucky for us we own this little keepsake of our time with Gloria in tropical paradise.
1	boy on fire FIRST OF ALL THE BOY IS STR8 FROM BATON ROUGE JUST LIKE LIL BOOSIE, MAXMINELLI, LIL WEBBIE,C-LOC AND J-VON. ALL THESE BOYS ARE GANGSTA'S IN THIS GAME AND BEEN DOIN IT FOR A MIN
0	No staying power A very lackluster effort. Sophomoric lyrics and for the most part had nothing to distinguish itself. I liked the title track a lot, and a couple of other ballad type songs, but the rest was poorly done and little imagination
0	Idea vs. Execution 2 1/2 stars Attempting another soundscape masterpiece, Stratosphere has not aged so well. The music - simple, the production- dated, the performances- uninspired. There are attempts at greatness, hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping. Mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as Jarre or Kraftwerk then their more inspired material. Whereas on an album like Phaedra, the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated, on Stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at, rather then truly feel. The self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay, but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating fast synth-bass-cheese, you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment.
1	Merengue Music for Christians! Juan Luis Guerra crea nuevamente canciones apasionantes, esta vez demostrando su "vida nueva". El ritmo sin embargo es el mismo "sabroso pa' bailar" de siempre
1	20/20... The Forgotten Gem The only reason I gave this four stars is because it's combined with Friends, which with the exception of Meant For You & the title song is just OK, in my opinion. 20/20, however is loaded with phenomenal songs. Do It Again,I Can Hear Music,Be With Me, Time To Get Alone,Our Prayer(a capella at it's best), etc. For some reason, critics never even gave this album a chance and I don't know why. Maybe it didn't fit the late 60's groove that was going on, but still the lyrics are strong and the harmonies are fantastic. Yes, there is that one song, "Never Learn not to Love", whose lyrics were written by Charles Manson, but the way the song is done by The Beach Boys is just too good to pass off just because of who wrote it. This 2 CD set also includes Break Away and We're Together Again, which are also excellent songs that never received any airplay. The only 2 songs that did were Do It Again and I Can Hear Music. My advice is to buy this while you can. You won't be disappointed!
1	Pure Genius Longesome Crowded West just somehow works. Everyone should have a listen! Polar Opposites is my favorite song of all time.
1	Long Awaited Black & Blue and Tobacco Road It's very hard for me to be objective about these two recordings by Lou Rawls and Onzy Matthews. I wore out my vinyl long, long ago and have been waiting for the CD issue of these records for 20 years. FINALLY! Great and creative big band writing by Onzy Matthews....The arrangements never get in Lou's way and such mature singing for a young guy. Lou's in great voice, the selection of material is first rate and the writing and playing top notch. Enough with the cliches........buy it..at two for the price of one
0	Don't Bother There's a reason that there are over 200,000 albums ranked before this one. Even if I was a big fan of rap, I would be a fan of bad rap. If you enjoy droning, monotone vocals with no real music to back it up then maybe this is for you, but even then I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe try Grits or something (try anything else... please!!)
0	Mass Hypnosis The only thing that can account for the acclaim that some have lavished on this album is mass hypnosis. Signor Bocelli's publicists have declared that he has 'the most beautiful voice in the world' and people believe it. I agree with the reviewer who described listening to this cd as painful. Everything sounds the same---like sandpaper. If he were not adorable and blind, this fellow would not have a career even as a pop artist, never mind opera singer. If you want to hear what opera sounds like at its best and most real today, check out Ramon Vargas, Juan Diego Florez, Rolando Villazon, Marcello Giordani and discover the difference between creme brulee and instant pudding
1	Those Great Bond Songs... 75% of the tracks on this CD are great. Takes you back to all the first times you saw the new bond film. Great insert, nice CD
1	magnificient ! Despite the few bad reviews I've read, I decided to buy the CD and decide by myself. And I don't regret it. The songs may not be easy to listen, but like any good book or great piece of art are hard to read and understand, if you are willing to get delighted by real music, you'll get it . There's lots of talent on this CD. It made my imagination and philosophies fly, made me cheerful, made me sad. My favorite songs: it;s hard to decide between so many. It brightenly opens with " No more a-roving" which, regardless of not containing Leonard's lyrics, he makes of this poem such a song !!! I love to listen to it while in my deck on a clear full moon night. "Nightingale" lifts up my mood so much and makes me feel so much at home (specially because I live in the mountains/woods) and am a nature/wildlife lover. "The Faith", just soothes my soul and relaxes me so much that takes me floating to the highest cloud, while listening to it watching the sun set on a cold afternoon....But right away I get up and start dancing to the tunes of "Tennessee Waltz, which IS NOT OUT OF TUNE like some reviewer mentioned. Here, Leonard is singing as imitating a "country/folk " singer due to the roots of the song. I love that song too ! In summary: I have to clean my CD, because i had played it over and over, and over and over...and I think it's dirty now...Like they said: "In the repetition you'll find the taste" Leonard's voice and Anjani's vocals make an amazing contrast. I give this CD a "FIVE" . Some may say because it fits my personality. I love contrast . I like being sad and then happy right after. I like to sooth my soul. I like Leonard Cohen
1	The James Dean of Jazz This, ladies and gentlemen, may be the best vocal Jazz album I have ever heard (I say have heard because I've only listened to maybe fifteen albums in the genre). By just destroying any credentials I had in the previous statement, lets move on to the review. This is a West Coast Jazz classic, truly one of the most overlooked outputs of the Cool School of Jazz. While not as technically competant as "Kind of Blue", I manage to listen to it just as much, if not more. Every song included on this disc is a classic standard, and Baker's version of "My Funny Valentine" is the greatest version of the song, beating out Sinatra's rendition by a mile. The instrumentation itself is flawless, as Mr. Baker's trumpet playing guides the band. He was as adept at the trumpet as he was at singing. The low-key and minimalist style of the band is perfect for the songs, and is one of the best bands in Jazz history. Influential and flawless, this is a must-have for any fan of post-war Jazz
